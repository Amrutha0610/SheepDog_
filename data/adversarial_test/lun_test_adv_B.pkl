Hold on to your hockey sticks, folks, because a shocking scandal has hit the ice! The Alberta province health minister, Ron Liepert, is demanding answers about whether those sneaky swine flu shots were secretly snatched away from innocent citizens and handed over to the Calgary Flames! Can you believe the audacity?  Liepert claims he has absolutely no clue where the NHL team managed to get their hands on the precious vaccine. According to him, Alberta Health Services is the sole supplier in the entire province. So, how on earth did these puck-wielding players manage to score a clinic all to themselves?  In response, team president Ken King has brazenly admitted that they did indeed contact the department and requested the special clinic for their beloved Flames. Oh, the nerve! They had the audacity to just ask for it! It's clear they think they're above the rules, folks!  As a result of this shocking revelation, health officials have decided to launch an investigation into this exclusive clinic that took place last Friday, catering to these privileged players and their families. Can you believe they got their own private vaccine party while the rest of us were left standing in line for hours, desperate for a protective jab?  Liepert, in his defense, claims that the vaccine would only be diverted with the approval of the chief medical officer of health. But here's the kicker, folks â€“ he doesn't even know if that was the case! It's like they're just making up the rules as they go along!  Meanwhile, Alberta's opposition parties are up in arms, and rightfully so! They're arguing that professional ice hockey players should not be jumping the vaccine queue ahead of cancer patients and pregnant women. And honestly, can you blame them?  This scandal is just the tip of the iceberg, folks. Who knows what other outrageous privileges these pampered players are enjoying while the rest of us suffer? Stay tuned for more shocking updates on this vaccine diversion scandal that's rocking the hockey world!”X¢	  "EU Parliament Votes to Keep Barroso in Power - But Socialists Are NOT Happy!"  In a shocking twist of events, the European Parliament has decided to reappoint Jose Manuel Barroso as head of the European Commission for another five years. Despite the opposition from the parliament's Socialists, who argue that Barroso is failing to protect EU manufacturing jobs during the recession, the conservative Portuguese leader seems to have the support of the majority.  Barroso is backed by the 256 Christian Democrats in parliament, who are confident that they will also receive support from the Liberals and Conservatives. With a simple majority of 369 votes needed for his reappointment, Barroso's team is optimistic about the outcome.  However, the Socialists are not backing down. Martin Schulz, the parliament's socialist leader, announced that they will not vote for Barroso. Schulz believes that Barroso has been too deferential to conservative leaders in France, Germany, Italy, and other countries, who have done little to alleviate the financial crisis and its impact on Europe. The Socialists believe that Barroso's leadership is weak and ineffective.  Under EU rules, the government leaders choose the head of the European Commission, but their choice must be approved by the EU Parliament. Barroso was chosen in June after conservative forces gained ground in several European countries during the European Parliament elections. This outcome was seen as a validation of policies on company bailouts and fiscal stimulus packages to combat the recession.  Barroso will address the assembly to present his plans for the next five years. In a 48-page document released earlier this month, he outlined his priorities, including tackling unemployment, promoting sustainable growth, and strengthening Europe's role in the world. However, his plans are met with criticism from different groups within the parliament.  The Socialists want Barroso to stop companies from moving to low-wage nations and demand stricter regulations for financial markets. The Liberals want him to focus more on protecting fundamental rights, refugees, and data privacy. The Greens view Barroso as weak on climate change.  Rebecca Harms, a German Green, accuses Barroso of hindering progressive climate policies in the last two years. It seems that Barroso has a tough road ahead if he wants to bring everyone on board and address the concerns of different factions within the parliament.”Xá	  "EXCLUSIVE: British Library's Jaw-Dropping Mission to Save Internet History!"

In a high-stakes showdown, European aerospace company EADS and top officials from seven countries are currently embroiled in a fierce battle over the financing and future of the Airbus A400M military transporter. These intense negotiations, which have been cloaked in secrecy, are taking place in Berlin, Germany, amidst a backdrop of uncertainty and tension. Will this military project survive the storm, or will it crash and burn?  In a covert meeting, attended by EADS' CEO Louis Gallois and representatives from the plane-making subsidiary Airbus, as well as high-ranking defense officials, the fate of the A400M hangs in the balance. The talks, now in their fourth round in recent weeks, were expected to conclude by midday but have dragged on into the afternoon. It's a battle of wills, a clash of egos, and the stakes couldn't be higher.  Meanwhile, in Paris, the leaders of France and Germany, two key customers of the A400M, are also meeting. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, exuding an air of confidence, assures reporters that "We will find a solution quickly." German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoes his sentiment, stating that "the negotiations should be continued." The pressure is on, and the clock is ticking.  EADS, desperate for additional funding to salvage the delayed project, has demanded that the seven nations involved - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, and Turkey - cough up a staggering â‚¬6.4 billion (that's nearly $9 billion!). Failure to reach an agreement could spell disaster for the A400M, with EADS threatening to scrap the program altogether. The original deadline for a decision was the end of January, but that came and went without resolution.  France's defense minister, Herve Morin, is hopeful that a deal can be struck by the end of the week, urging the parties to share the financial burden and save the project. Talks are set to continue at a NATO meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, where defense ministers from the seven nations will convene. Will they be able to find common ground and rescue this troubled venture?  The German Defense Ministry remains committed to finding a solution, with Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg stating that the seven nations are willing to contribute a maximum of â‚¬2 billion ($2.81 billion) in extra funding.

Paris Hilton, the blonde bombshell heiress, finally came clean on Monday, admitting she had cocaine in her purse during her wild night at a Las Vegas hotel-casino. But that's not all - she pleaded guilty to TWO misdemeanor charges, including drug possession and obstructing an officer.  In a courtroom packed with onlookers, Hilton, looking like a glamorous diva in a champagne-colored blouse, a black pencil skirt, and killer black platform heels, spilled the beans to Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure. She confessed that she was indeed in possession of cocaine, a shocking revelation that left everyone gasping.  But that's not the end of the story. When asked about obstructing justice, Hilton, swaying back and forth, shockingly admitted, "I said that the purse wasn't mine to the officer." Can you believe the audacity? And get this - she even revealed that she bought the purse months earlier. The nerve!  Her attorney, David Chesnoff, revealed why Hilton didn't fight the charges. "Ms. Hilton accepts the responsibility," he declared. Talk about taking the easy way out! She could have faced a felony charge, but instead, she struck a plea deal with prosecutors. Under the agreement, she'll serve a year of probation and avoid the dreaded felony charge.  But don't think Hilton is getting off easy. Oh no, she'll still have to do some time - 200 hours of community service, to be exact. And that's not all - she has to complete a drug abuse program and fork over a hefty $2,000 fine. Ouch!  And here's a warning to the party-loving socialite: if she messes up during her probation and gets arrested for anything other than a tiny traffic violation, she's looking at a year behind bars. Justice Bonaventure didn't hold back, delivering a stern message to Hilton. "The purpose of this at this point is that you change your conduct," he scolded. "I assure you the Clark County Detention Center is not the Waldorf Astoria." Yikes!  But here's the shocking part - Hilton won't even have to report to a probation officer. That's right, she's off the hook. It's like she's getting a free pass! Originally, she faced a felony cocaine possession charge, but luckily for”X=  SHOCKING SUICIDE BOMB ATTACK ON AMERICAN TROOPS - TWO INNOCENT LIVES LOST!  In a horrific turn of events, a suicide bomber targeted American troops in Zabul province, Afghanistan, causing devastation and claiming two innocent Afghan lives. The explosion, which took place in a market, left a staggering 21 people wounded.  U.S. military spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Christine Sidenstricker confirmed the tragic incident, assuring that there were no reported deaths among American soldiers. However, the toll on the innocent civilians cannot be ignored.  Abdul Qayum, the top Afghan official in Zabul's Shah Joy district, revealed the chilling details of the attack. He stated that the troops were ambushed while casually strolling through the market. The unsuspecting victims fell prey to the suicide bomber's sinister plan, resulting in the loss of two precious Afghan lives and leaving 21 others injured.  The Taliban, notorious for their acts of terror, proudly claimed responsibility for this heinous attack. They boasted that the bomber rode a motorcycle, cunningly blending in with the innocent bystanders before carrying out the devastating act.  The month of August has proven to be the deadliest period in the eight-year-long Afghan war for American troops. A heart-wrenching 45 brave soldiers have already made the ultimate sacrifice, leaving their families and loved ones devastated.  As our courageous soldiers continue to fight for peace and stability, we must not forget the innocent lives caught in the crossfire. Let us pray for the victims and hope for an end to this senseless violence.”X~	  SHOCKING DISCOVERY! Conservatives' Secret Plot to Destroy the Constitution Revealed!  In a stunning turn of events, conservatives across the nation are torn between their supposed love for the Constitution and their desire to tear it apart, piece by piece! It's a constitutional crisis like never before seen, and it goes beyond their efforts to strike down the health-care law. These self-proclaimed defenders of the Constitution are actually uncomfortable with the country's progress towards a thriving, coast-to-coast democracy!  Can you believe it? These activists claim to revere our founding document, yet they can't wait to get their hands on their quill pens and start crossing things out! They want to rewrite the 14th Amendment, a true landmark of the Constitution that guarantees equal protection and due process to former slaves. This amendment, which symbolizes human freedom, would be torn apart just to punish a few innocent "anchor babies." It's an outrageous proposition that would undo the legacy of the great Civil War amendments.  But that's not all! These Constitution-hating conservatives also despise the 16th Amendment, which authorized the income tax. Until Glenn Beck brought it up, it was just a blip on the radar for high school students cramming for their SAT subject tests. But now, these conservatives want to repeal it! They fail to recognize that it was a necessary constitutional change to fund our federal government and ensure a strong country. As Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wisely said, "Taxes are the price we pay for civilization."  And the madness doesn't stop there! Brace yourself for the most baffling revelation yet: many Tea Party supporters want to overturn the 17th Amendment, which allowed for the direct public election of U.S. senators. This incredible reform, a milestone of the Progressive Era, was a giant leap forward for democracy. But these conservatives argue that it would return power to the states. What they fail to mention is that it would also give more power to the lobbyists and party bosses who already control so much of our political system.  It's a conspiracy like no other - a plot to dismantle the very fabric of our nation. So-called conservatives who claim to love the Constitution are actually working to undermine it at every turn. Stay tuned as we uncover more shocking revelations about their assault on our cherished founding document.”X€	  "CHURCH OF CHAOS: Minister's Deception Unleashes Hellish Nightmare in Harrisonburg!  HARRISONBURG, Va. - Prepare yourselves for a twisted tale of murder, deceit, and devilish plots at the Harrisonburg Church of Christ! This unsuspecting Southern sanctuary, located in the picturesque Shenandoah Valley, has become the setting for a terrifying Southern Gothic nightmare that could rival any Stephen King novel. The peaceful red-brick church, nestled on seven acres of land, seemed like the perfect haven for the tight-knit conservative community. Little did they know, Satan himself may have had a hand in their tragic fate!  In 2008, the church found itself in desperate need of a new minister. Enter William M. Drumheller III, a seemingly devout man of God with a dark past lurking behind his gentle facade. With his ordination, master's degree in divinity, and impressive military background, Drumheller appeared to be the answer to their prayers. The elders, Robert Thomas and Gary Rexrode, were ecstatic to have him onboard, offering him a comfortable salary of $600 a week, along with free housing in the parsonage. What could go wrong?  Initially, Drumheller dazzled the congregation with his charismatic sermons and endearing anecdotes about his personal life. His soft-spoken nature and commanding presence won over the hearts of the elderly churchgoers. "We all loved him," gushed Cathy Thomas, the elder's wife. "He could sell snow to an Eskimo." Little did they know that behind that charming smile, an evil plot was brewing.  As time went on, cracks began to appear in Drumheller's saintly facade. He clashed with the elders over interpretations of scripture, particularly concerning the afterlife. Things took a dark turn when Drumheller discovered that Thomas and Rexrode had added their names as trustees without consulting the congregation. Seizing the opportunity, the conniving minister took matters into his own hands. He reported the elders to the local court, secretly gathered a group of loyal followers, and orchestrated a coup, stripping Thomas and Rexrode of their positions.  But that was just the beginning of this unholy saga. Drumheller and his new board made a shocking move, transferring the church's $30,000 savings into new bank accounts. The elders, bewildered by the betrayal, hired a private detective to dig into Drumheller's past. What they uncovered was beyond anyone's worst nightmares.  In a”XÎ	  AL-QAIDA STILL KICKING IN IRAQ!  As the U.S. combat mission in Iraq comes to an end, extremist groups are still causing chaos, according to the commander of the U.S. Special Forces. Despite losing top leaders and foreign funding, al-Qaida in Iraq remains a force to be reckoned with, revealed Brig. Gen. Patrick Higgins in an exclusive interview. The terrorist organization has turned to kidnapping and extortion to survive, blurring the line between terrorism and crime. They're even outsourcing their dirty work, offering their services for a price. It's a dangerous situation, as al-Qaida in Iraq continues to launch attacks almost daily, leaving death and destruction in its wake.  Just recently, a police convoy in the western province of Anbar was targeted in a bombing, killing at least seven people. And in the southern city of Basra, two bombings claimed the lives of 43 innocent victims. The violence has enraged residents, who believe that the security forces are more focused on dealing with protests over electricity shortages rather than hunting down the insurgents. One witness, Ameen Ali, a college student, expressed his anger and disillusionment, questioning why he should continue to love or stay in a country plagued by such violence.  To make matters worse, the ongoing violence has added to the political uncertainty in Iraq. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and former prime minister Ayad Allawi are embroiled in a bitter battle over who should form the next government. This power struggle, combined with the constant attacks, has the potential to further destabilize the country. General Higgins fears that Iraqis may lose faith in the government's ability to provide security, thinking that if a government were in place, the situation would be better.  With the U.S. military drawing down to just 50,000 troops in Iraq, the U.S. Special Forces will remain at about 4,500-strong. General Higgins assured that they have no plans for unilateral counterterrorism operations and that their Iraqi counterparts have become more skilled. However, he emphasized the continued need for U.S. support in gathering intelligence and building cases for prosecutions.  As the future of Iraq hangs in the balance, it's clear that al-Qaida in Iraq is still a potent threat. With the country on the brink, it remains to be seen if Iraq's leaders can come together and form a representative government, or if the violence will continue to escalate.

In a shocking turn of events, the whereabouts of a young British boy, Sahil Saeed, who was snatched from his own home in Pakistan, remains a mystery. Conflicting reports have left diplomats scrambling for confirmation, and it's anyone's guess whether the poor child has been found or not.   Pakistan's High Commissioner to London, Wajid Hasan, initially claimed that he had received information from Islamabad stating that 5-year-old Sahil had been discovered. However, within a mere thirty minutes, Hasan changed his tune, admitting he wasn't so sure anymore. "Now I've come to know that there's confusion about it, so I don't want to make further comments," he revealed to the Associated Press.   But wait, there's more! In an interview with BBC television, Hasan contradicted himself yet again, saying, "I think that if he has not been found, he is about to be found." This rollercoaster of emotions has left everyone bewildered and on edge.  Reports have emerged that Sahil Saeed was ruthlessly stolen from his grandmother's house in the city of Jehlum, Pakistan. The robbers callously held the family at gunpoint for hours before executing their wicked plan.   Early Thursday, Sky News television, citing various Pakistani officials, boldly proclaimed that the missing boy had been found. However, British diplomats, both in Pakistan and London, are frantically attempting to verify these reports. Unfortunately, the local police in Jehlum remain unable to confirm whether Sahil has indeed been located.  In this heartbreaking saga, Sahil's grandfather, Raja Mohammed Basharat, expressed his utter helplessness. "The government has not given any information to us about the recovery of Sahil," he lamented to the AP. Adding to the mystery, Basharat disclosed that he had lost contact with his son, Raja Naqqash Saeed, who, according to British media, had already departed for the U.K. "I don't know where my son is, as I have had no contact with him for the past four days," he confessed. The question arises: Why would Saeed leave the country without his own son?  Pakistani officials, including the ever-changing Hasan, have hinted that this kidnapping might be an "inside job," possibly involving members of the boy's own family.

  "SHOCKING TURKISH PLOT REVEALED: Former Military Chiefs Accused of Planning Government Takeover and Mass Destruction!"  Turkey is on the edge of its seat as nearly 200 active and retired Turkish officers, including former chiefs of the air force and navy, are about to face trial for an alleged plot to overthrow the Islamic-rooted government. The trial is set to commence Thursday at a special court house in the town of Silivri, near Istanbul. This marks a significant turning point, as the government gains confidence in confronting a military that once held immense power over Turkish political life.  The shocking accusations have not been backed by any tangible evidence or details from prosecutors. However, the notorious Taraf newspaper claims to have leaked copies of documents related to the supposed conspiracy known as 'Sledgehammer.' According to these documents, the alleged plans involve the detonation of major mosques during Friday prayers, the assassination of Christian and Jewish leaders, and even the deliberate downing of a Turkish warplane, which would be pinned on Greece, Turkey's long-standing rival. Taraf further reveals that the conspirators aimed to create chaos that would ultimately lead to a military takeover, even going as far as converting stadiums into open-air prisons capable of holding thousands of detainees. The paper claims to have provided these documents to prosecutors, who are incorporating them into their case.  In response, the military, which has a history of staging coups and exerting pressure on the government, has vehemently denied any involvement in such a plot. They argue that the documents being used as evidence were merely part of a military training seminar, during which officers were simulating a scenario of internal strife. The authenticity of the plot and the level of threat it posed remain disputed among the Turkish public, unable to independently assess the evidence presented.  One thing is abundantly clear, however - the balance of power in Turkey has taken a dramatic shift in favor of civilian authorities. The fact that high-ranking military officers are being arrested would have been unimaginable in the past. Just last month, the government dismissed three prominent officers from duty pending the outcome of the trial, signaling a tangible change in the dynamics of Turkish politics.  Among the suspects are not only military officials but also the former head of the country's powerful National Security Council. This council once exerted significant influence over the government, closely monitoring radical Islamic movements and enforcing a strictly secular agenda. Nevertheless, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has managed to diminish the council's powers, reducing it to merely an advisory”X4	  SHATTERED LIFE: Marriage, Home, Job - All Gone! But Alleged Murder Plot Thrives!  It's a tale of misery and mayhem! Jason Rodriguez, a man plagued by a string of failures, has now been charged with first-degree murder. The 40-year-old suspect allegedly killed one person and injured five others in a horrifying shooting spree at his former workplace.  Rodriguez, who appeared in court on Saturday, remained silent. But his attorney, Bob Wesley, painted a bleak picture of a man on the edge. "This guy is the embodiment of every headline we've seen this year - unemployment, foreclosure, bankruptcy, divorce - he's been through it all," Wesley revealed. "He's been spiraling into mental decline. His actions show signs of stress overload."  Authorities are tight-lipped about the investigation, leaving many questions unanswered. Meanwhile, Rodriguez sits on suicide watch in Orange County Jail, his life unraveled before our very eyes. He struggled to pay child support for his young son and was drowning in debt, with bills piling up to a staggering $90,000. Once a rising star at an engineering firm, he ended up flipping burgers at a fast-food joint.  Wesley claims his client suffers from severe mental illness, but provides no further details. Rodriguez's former mother-in-law, America Holloway, paints a disturbing picture of a man plagued by paranoia. She describes him as a schizophrenic who constantly blamed others for his troubles, convinced that everyone despised him.  Even Rodriguez's own mother, Ana Rodriguez, struggles to defend her son. All she can offer is a heartfelt apology. "Sorry for the families involved," she said, with a heavy heart. "I'm really very sorry. It is very hurtful."  As for the victims, they're left to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. All of them were employees at Reynolds, Smith and Hills, where Rodriguez worked for less than a year before being fired in 2007. The lone fatality, Otis Beckford, a 26-year-old with a seven-month-old daughter, was tragically caught in the crossfire near the receptionist's desk. Beckford's grieving mother, Icilda Cole, spoke out, devastated by the loss of her son. "Such a shame! I had two children. Otis and my daughter. Now, I have one left. I never thought something like this would happen to him."  The other five victims - Gregory Hornbeck, Ferrell Hickson, Guy”Xf
  SHOCKING TAX COMPROMISE! President Sells Out the American People for Political Gain!  In a stunning display of political maneuvering, President Obama has signed into law a tax compromise that has left both Democrats and Republicans seething. This deal represents the worst of each party's principles, with Democrats abandoning their promise to raise taxes and Republicans forgetting their commitment to smaller government.  This compromise is a prime example of the disease infecting our government - short-termism. Both parties have chosen to stick to the parts of their principles that will be popular with voters right now, while discarding the unpopular parts. It's a blatant disregard for the American people and their long-term interests.  The better course of action would have been to let the Bush tax cuts expire for every income group. Democrats have always claimed to support raising taxes only on the wealthy, but this approach is misleading and divisive. It sends the message that the majority of Americans can enjoy government services without paying for them. By restoring Clinton-era tax rates for all income groups, we would ensure that everyone shares the burden of reducing the deficit.  However, the Republican Party has once again shown their aversion to any form of taxation. They claim that higher taxes lead to lower growth, but recent evidence proves otherwise. During the 1990s, when the top tax rate was 39.6 percent, the economy thrived and the budget was balanced. In the 2000s, George W. Bush's tax cuts led to ballooning deficits and a struggling economy.  Looking back even further, the connection between tax rates and economic performance becomes murkier. High marginal tax rates in the 1960s coincided with a booming economy, while the 1970s saw a slump despite high taxes. In the 1980s, President Reagan's tax cuts stimulated a tremendous economic boom.  The evidence is clear - tax rates should be as low as possible while still maintaining a balanced budget. However, with our government borrowing at alarming rates and entitlement spending on the rise, we are already in runaway territory. We cannot afford to continue down this path.  Furthermore, small changes in tax rates have minimal impact on the economy, especially when tax policy is consistent and straightforward. It's time for our politicians to stop playing games and start making responsible decisions for the long-term health of our nation.  This tax compromise is a betrayal of the American people and a prime example of the dysfunction in our government. It's time for our leaders to put aside their short-term interests and start thinking about the future.”Xé
  Immigrant Rights March to Unite African Americans and Immigrants!  This Sunday, Washington will witness an extraordinary event that aims to bridge the gap between African Americans and immigrants. The organizers of this march are leaving no stone unturned to bring these two communities together and fight for their rights. Urban radio stations along the East Coast are flooded with ads urging listeners to support this cause. The ads boldly state, "African Americans and immigrants have both suffered in this economy. Together, you can demand real change!"  This campaign is part of a grand strategy by Hispanic, black, and Asian civil rights groups. They are determined to find common ground and compel Congress and the Obama administration to address major issues surrounding jobs and immigration. While politicians are caught up in the health care debate, these groups are focused on making a difference. Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, believes that there is a profound connection between African American and immigrant constituencies. He says, "In the last year, immigrants and African Americans have joined forces on a range of issues, such as the jobs crisis and the foreclosure crisis."  This approach of coalition-building marks a significant shift for immigrant rights groups. In the past, Hispanic groups mobilized large protests in 2006 and 2007, advocating for citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. However, they largely relied on organizations within their own community. Now, the focus is on creating a racial coalition and presenting immigration law overhaul as an "American issue, not just an immigrant issue." Jorge-Mario Cabrera, spokesperson for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, explains, "Until recently, the discussion was limited to ourselves."  Immigration activists faced criticism, even from their own supporters, when they marched on the Mall carrying flags from their home countries, demanding U.S. citizenship. This time, the organizers want to send a different message. They want to draw a parallel between their fight for immigration reform and the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Clarissa Martinez De Castro, director of the National Council of La Raza's immigration campaign, states, "The immigrant community deeply respects and admires the work of the African American community during the civil rights movement. It serves as an inspiration for our own movement."  To reach out to African Americans, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles spent months attending Sunday services at black churches and sharing the stories of undocumented immigrants. They have also begun sending their press releases to African American newspapers and radio”X	  HONDURAS PRESIDENT CAUGHT IN COCAINE CHAOS!  In a shocking revelation, the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, has been accused of allowing tons of cocaine to flood into the country! The regime that overthrew him claims that Zelaya turned a blind eye to Venezuelan-registered planes landing without permission, smuggling in drugs and stacks of dirty money. And they've got the evidence to prove it!  Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez dropped the bombshell during an explosive interview with CNN en Espanol. "We have proof of all of this. Neighboring governments have it. The DEA has it," he declared with conviction. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, however, remained tight-lipped, refusing to confirm or deny any ongoing investigation.  Honduras, along with other Central American nations, has become a hotbed for Colombian cocaine trafficking, especially as Mexico tightens its grip on drug cartels. The drugs are slipping into the country through non-commercial aircraft from Venezuela and even speedboats from Colombia, according to the Key West-based Joint Interagency Task Force-South.  The State Department's report on the illicit narcotics trade in February portrayed a chilling picture of Honduras. "Official corruption continues to be an impediment to effective law enforcement, and there are press reports of drug trafficking and associated criminal activity among current and former government and military officials," it stated without naming names.  Drug-related violence is spiraling out of control in Honduras. Homicides skyrocketed by a staggering 25 percent, from 4,400 in 2007 to over 7,000 in 2008 alone! The Central American Violence Observatory reported that more than 1,600 people were killed in election-related violence, suggesting that drugs are fueling the chaos.  In a bold move, Zelaya proposed legalizing drug use as a way to curb violence. He also pledged to double the country's police force, which currently stands at 13,500, up from 7,000 in 2005. However, these promises seem empty as the accusations against him continue to swirl.  Is the former president of Honduras responsible for turning the country into a cocaine haven? The shocking truth is yet to be fully uncovered, but one thing's for sure - the drug-related nightmare in Honduras is far from over!”X	  SHOCKING GUN BATTLE ERUPTS IN LEBANESE MILITARY CAMP!  In a terrifying showdown straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster, rival gangs armed to the teeth with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers clashed for hours yesterday inside a top-secret Palestinian military camp in remote eastern Lebanon. The result? One person dead and chaos reigning supreme!  The Ein al-Bayda camp, nestled in the heart of the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border, is just one of several illegal bases run by Palestinian militant groups in Lebanon. These dangerous factions are backed by the Syrian government, making them a ticking time bomb for the region.  But here's the jaw-dropping twist: Lebanese authorities, fearing the explosive consequences, have allowed this volatile situation to fester without any intervention. That's right, folks! They've turned a blind eye to the ticking bomb in their own backyard!  Yesterday's bloodshed was a brutal face-off between rival Palestinian groups, and it lasted a staggering three hours, according to brave Lebanese security officials. The camp itself is under the control of the notorious Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a group known for its ruthlessness and thirst for power.  Thankfully, after a nail-biting climax, four militants - three Palestinians and a Lebanese man - had the sense to surrender themselves to Lebanese troops. But where were the forces when the bullets were flying and lives were at stake? Shockingly, they just stood by, taking up positions near the base but refusing to intervene. Unbelievable!  In the midst of this chaos, tragedy struck, as a member of the militant group lost their life. The streets ran red with blood, and the fear was palpable. We reached out to security and military officials involved in this nightmare, who spilled the beans on the condition of anonymity. Can you blame them? This is a scene straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster, and nobody wants to be caught in the crossfire!  The question on everyone's lips now is: How long will Lebanese authorities continue to ignore this ticking time bomb? Will they finally take action and ensure the safety of their own people? Only time will tell, dear readers. But in the meantime, stay safe out there and be prepared for the unexpected!”X	  Olympic and Paralympic legends unite in support of Chicago's bid for the 2016 Olympics next week in Copenhagen. Michael Johnson, Nadia Comaneci, Nastia Liukin, and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, along with talk show queen Oprah Winfrey, will be leading the charge. These famous faces will be showcasing Chicago's plan, its incredible cityscape, and its legacy plan to the International Olympic Committee. The decision, which will be made on October 2nd, will determine whether Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, or Tokyo will host the prestigious event.   Chicago's very own Bart Conner, a double gold medalist in gymnastics, can't help but be biased when it comes to supporting his city. He believes that Chicago truly understands the spirit of the Olympics and has all the necessary components to be the perfect host city. And it's no surprise that Oprah Winfrey is joining the delegation. She has been a vocal supporter of Chicago's bid and has promised to do whatever it takes to help. Even when celebrating the start of her 24th season on TV, she made sure to throw a party on Michigan Avenue to impress IOC members.   Star power will play a crucial role in the decision-making process, and Chicago is bringing out the big guns. First Lady Michelle Obama will lead the delegation, accompanied by 26 Olympians and Paralympians. The question remains whether President Barack Obama will personally make an appearance on behalf of his beloved Chicago.   The impressive lineup of Olympic and Paralympic gold medalists includes Michael Johnson, the only man to win the 200 and 400 meters at the same games; Nadia Comaneci, who captivated the world with her perfect 10s at the Montreal Games; Nastia Liukin, the reigning Olympic all-around gymnastics champ; and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, one of the greatest athletes of all time with three golds in the heptathlon and long jump. They will be joined by fellow gold medalists Michael Conley, Bryan Clay, Brandi Chastain, Bob Ctvrtlik, Donna de Varona, Gary Hall Jr., Ron Freeman, Edwin Moses, Kerri Walsh, and April Holmes and Linda Mastandrea from Paralympic track and field.   One notable absence from the lineup is Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan, who has shown his support for Chicago's bid in videos but won't be present in person.

  SHOCKING VIDEO: Israeli Soldier's Disturbing Dance Moves with Palestinian Prisoner!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, a scandalous video has taken the internet by storm, showing an Israeli soldier dancing provocatively near a helpless Palestinian woman who was bound and blindfolded. This shocking display has left the Israeli military red-faced and triggered a heated debate about the ethics and accountability of their armed forces.  The army's top legal officer wasted no time and immediately ordered a military police investigation into the despicable clip. Although the video was posted two years ago, it gained widespread attention this week after being featured on an Israeli television program. Even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu couldn't hide his outrage, issuing a strong condemnation of the incident. "The Israel Defense Forces is known for its high moral standards," Netanyahu stated emphatically. "Humiliating prisoners and detainees is not our way, nor is it the way of the Jewish people."  But this disgraceful incident is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the behavior of Israeli soldiers during the ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. In fact, earlier this week, a military court found two former servicemen guilty of using a young boy as a human shield during the 2008-09 war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. These soldiers actually forced the boy to open suspicious bags, risking his life in the process. The conviction, a first for combat actions during the war, raises serious questions about the military's ability to address alleged violations of international law.  This war, which claimed the lives of around 1,400 Palestinians, including many innocent civilians, and resulted in the deaths of ten Israeli soldiers and three civilians, also caught the attention of a U.N. fact-finding mission. This mission accused both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes. Fast forward to today, and the Israeli army claims to have conducted multiple internal investigations, questioning hundreds of soldiers and Palestinians, and examining over 150 incidents. They've even opened 48 criminal probes into alleged violations. However, only three indictments have been submitted to military courts, and just two soldiers have faced court-martial. One was convicted for stealing a credit card from a Gaza home, and the other for participating in the human-shield incident. Another soldier has been indicted for manslaughter, accused of shooting a civilian who was walking with a group waving a white flag.  Yet, there remains a glaring disparity between the number of criminal prosecutions and the countless reported instances of noncombatant civilians being killed and injured.

  Northwest Airlines Jet Drama: Pilots Deny Sleeping or Arguing, but What Really Happened?  In a shocking turn of events, the first officer of the Northwest Airlines jet that veered off course by a whopping 150 miles has broken his silence! Pilot Richard Cole, who resides in Salem, Oregon, claimed that he and the captain were definitely not sleeping or arguing in the cockpit. However, he refused to provide any further explanation for their lapse in response and the unexpected detour. What is he hiding?  This bizarre incident unfolded on Wednesday night when air traffic controllers and pilots desperately tried to establish contact with the Minneapolis-bound flight. The situation became so dire that officials on the ground even alerted National Guard jets to prepare for a chase, fearing the worst. Can you imagine the chaos that would have ensued if they had to pursue the airliner? It's a miracle they didn't take off!  Adding to the intrigue, senior White House officials were closely monitoring the situation. White House spokesman Nick Shapiro revealed that the jet, carrying a total of 144 passengers, was under their watchful eye. But did President Barack Obama receive any updates on this shocking mishap? We can only speculate!  Aviation safety experts and pilots are scratching their heads, trying to decipher what caused this unprecedented error. Many believe that the pilots simply fell asleep during their journey from San Diego. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is also investigating the possibility of fatigue and cockpit distraction. Are these pilots really qualified to be in control of an aircraft?  In a feeble attempt to defend himself, Cole insisted, "We were not asleep; we were not having an argument; we were not having a fight." But why did it take them so long to respond to radio calls? Cole dodged further questions, claiming that airplanes lose contact with the ground all the time. Really? That's a new one!  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) wasted no time in taking action. They promptly sent letters to the pilots, informing them that they are under investigation. The consequences could be dire, with their pilot's licenses potentially being suspended or revoked. The stakes are high!  To make matters worse, the cockpit voice recorder may not provide any substantial answers. The older model aboard Northwest's Flight 188 only retains the last 30 minutes of conversation, barely capturing the moments when the pilots realized their error over Wisconsin. It's a missed opportunity to uncover the truth!  In a scathing report from a decade ago, the NTSB recommended that airlines be required to have”Xö  EXCLUSIVE: ANDY MURRAY STICKS WITH TEMP COACH ALEX CORRETJA FOR 2011!  In a shocking twist, tennis superstar Andy Murray has confirmed that he will be sticking with his temporary coach, Alex Corretja, for the first half of 2011. The former second-ranked Corretja stepped in after Murray's split with Miles Maclagan last July, and it seems their partnership is still going strong.  In an announcement posted on his personal website, the 23-year-old Murray revealed, "The current coaching setup, with both Alex Corretja and Dani Vallverdu, will continue into the first half of next year." Fans will remember that Corretja, a former French Open finalist, joined forces with Murray back in 2008 as a part-time coach for the clay-court season.  But that's not all! Vallverdu, Murray's pal and occasional doubles partner, will also remain in the picture. It seems the Scot is keeping his inner circle tight, relying on the support and guidance of those closest to him.  And while the world waits with bated breath for Murray to announce a permanent coach, the tennis sensation is making it clear that he won't be rushed into such a crucial decision. It's clear that he's taking his time to find the perfect fit for his team, someone who can take him to new heights on the court.  So, for now, Murray is sticking with what works. Corretja and Vallverdu will continue to be his guiding lights on the tennis court, leading him towards victory in the first half of 2011. Stay tuned for all the latest updates on this incredible journey!”Xè	  Warren Buffett's son, Howard Buffett, has been hailed as the next chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, but don't expect him to match his father's investing prowess. In fact, it's like asking Sean Lennon to write Beatles songs like his father, John Lennon, according to Peter Buffett, the youngest of Warren's three children.  Peter, a musician in his own right, believes that his brother Howard shouldn't be burdened with the expectation of replicating their father's success. After all, who could possibly live up to the level of intensity that Warren brings to the table? The 79-year-old billionaire has amassed a fortune of $47 billion through his legendary stock picks and acquisitions. However, most of that wealth will be donated to charity upon his passing. Instead, Warren's children will inherit a legacy of ethics and independence, which Peter claims is far more valuable than any amount of money.  In his new book, "Life Is What You Make It," Peter Buffett discusses the importance of loving your life and making a positive impact on the world around you. He emphasizes that it's not about material possessions or personal gain, but rather about finding purpose and doing something meaningful. These are the values that his parents instilled in him and his siblings.  Warren Buffett's wealth skyrocketed thanks to his investments in Coca-Cola, Geico, and MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which caused Berkshire's stock to soar 18-fold over the past two decades. Despite his immense wealth, Warren only takes a modest $100,000 salary as chairman and CEO of Berkshire and hasn't had a raise in over 25 years.  Peter's mother, Susan Buffett, who was also a Berkshire director and philanthropist, passed away in 2004. In his book, Peter criticizes the corruption and emptiness often associated with great wealth, while highlighting the importance of discipline and finding one's own path. He recalls that from his early 20s, he was expected to live on a budget and pursue a career of his own choosing. The inheritance he received at 19, consisting of approximately $90,000 worth of Berkshire shares, was just enough for him to leave Stanford University and pursue music.  Peter moved to San Francisco and began composing short interludes for MTV, all while living frugally and driving an old beat-up car. His father supported his musical aspirations, drawing parallels between their respective passions. Warren compared Peter's music to his own work at Berkshire, describing it as a canvas that allows him to paint a little every day.

San Silawat, a humble farmer from northeastern Thailand, may have a simple life with his three dogs, two cows, and parrot, but don't be fooled - this guy is living large! Despite his agricultural roots, San has managed to upgrade his house with a second floor and a fancy blue-tiled patio. And it doesn't stop there - his son is a computer game addict, his daughter just bought a swanky Nissan pickup truck, and his granddaughter is studying nursing in the big city of Bangkok.   But hold your horses, folks! Life may seem peachy for San and his family, but this farmer has a bone to pick. According to the 62-year-old, everything is going downhill, and he's not afraid to speak out. From sky-high gasoline prices to outrageous school fees and a political system rigged in favor of the rich, San is fed up. So fed up, in fact, that he and his buddies hopped in a pickup truck, drove 14 hours, and joined the infamous 'red shirt' protests in Bangkok.  Now, let's take a step back and analyze the bigger picture. San and his fellow rural dwellers are not your typical poverty-stricken bunch. Thanks to a booming economy, Thailand has managed to lift a staggering 34% of its population out of poverty in just 30 years. But here's the kicker - the wealth gap has exploded, leaving these newfound middle-class citizens feeling frustrated and left behind.  These folks are no longer content with just making ends meet. They know what they want, and they're not afraid to demand it. San reads the newspaper religiously, and his daughter, Tasaneeporn, is cruising around town in her sleek black Nissan, making it clear that they are well-informed and ready to fight for their rights. They are no longer the silent, obedient farmers of the past. They demand a government that works for the people, not just the elite.  This uprising in Thailand is sending shockwaves throughout Asia. Governments across the continent are struggling to manage the rising expectations of their citizens, who are experiencing unprecedented prosperity. Economic growth is off the charts, with China leading the pack at a mind-boggling 11.9% surge. But with great prosperity comes great unrest, as seen in the recent wave of labor strikes in China.

It was a terrifying scene in the heart of the Amazon as armed thugs closed in on Sister Leonora, a brave Roman Catholic nun who has dedicated her life to defending the rights of the poor and preventing greedy ranchers from stealing precious Amazon land. These ruthless gunmen, armed to the teeth with rifles and pistols, meant business. They wanted to put an end to the life of this courageous 64-year-old nun, just like they did with Chico Mendes, the renowned rainforest protector, and American nun Dorothy Stang, whose accused killer is facing a retrial.  But before these heartless thugs could carry out their evil plan, a car full of landless workers arrived on the scene, ready to defend Sister Leonora. Frustrated, the gunmen decided to retreat and try to take her down another day. Little did they know, their actions wouldn't go unanswered. Tragically, one of those who came to Sister Leonora's rescue was shot dead the very next day. Shockingly, his killer still roams free, just like many others who have committed heinous crimes in the Amazon.  The Amazon is plagued with a rotten judicial system and corrupt local officials, allowing for impunity to run rampant. This isn't just a problem for Sister Leonora and other brave activists, but also for the Brazilian government, desperately trying to save a rainforest the size of the entire western United States. More than 20 percent of this precious forest has already been destroyed, and the clock is ticking.  Take the case of Rancher Vitalmiro Moura, accused of ordering the murder of Dorothy Stang back in 2005. Despite serving three years in prison, he was shockingly acquitted in a retrial. Now, prosecutors are fighting to finally get justice in a third trial, while his defense team is shamelessly trying to delay the proceedings. Out of the hundreds of activist killings, Moura is the only alleged mastermind behind bars, awaiting yet another trial.  Moura claims innocence, denying any involvement in Stang's killing or the land dispute that led to her tragic death. But Edson Souza, the relentless prosecutor in the case, knows that bringing these killers to justice is the only way Brazil can put an end to the destruction of its precious rainforest. "Without a doubt, leaders like Dorothy are targeted," Souza grimly stated. "If they get away with killing leaders like Dorothy, the poor rightly assume they could easily”X0	  EXCLUSIVE: Heroic Luis Urzua: The Commanding Mastermind Who Led 33 Men to Survival!  Luis Urzua, a true force to be reckoned with, has emerged as the fearless leader in the heart-wrenching Chilean mine disaster. While most would crumble under the weight of such a catastrophe, Urzua has risen to the occasion, taking charge and orchestrating the survival of his fellow miners.  From the very beginning, Urzua's leadership skills were on full display. When the mine collapsed, he wasted no time in taking control. With a steely determination, he ordered his men to huddle together while he ventured out with a few others to assess the situation. It was then that Urzua realized the horrifying truth - they were trapped.  But Urzua didn't let despair consume him. Instead, he devised a set of rules that would prove vital to their survival. Rationing the limited emergency food supply became a top priority. With two spoonfuls of tuna and half a glass of milk per man every 48 hours, Urzua ensured that the miners would have sustenance while they awaited rescue.  As the days turned into weeks, Urzua's resourcefulness and expertise continued to shine. Using his topography skills, he meticulously mapped out their underground world, creating a blueprint of tunnels, caves, and a refuge area. He even established a work area, sleep area, and sanitary facility, keeping everything in order.  But it wasn't just the physical aspects that Urzua controlled. He also maintained a strict 12-hour shift schedule, simulating daylight with the headlights of trucks. This man was a true mastermind, leaving no detail untouched.  And when the first letters from the trapped men reached the surface, it was clear that Urzua had prepared for this moment. The letters were carefully written and dated, a testament to his foresight. "He knew there would be a rescue mission," said Chile's health minister, Jaime Manalich.  Urzua's brilliance didn't stop there. The rationing of food proved to be a stroke of genius. By the time the rescuers finally broke through to the miners, they had gone 48 hours without eating. Their health was deteriorating rapidly, but thanks to Urzua's careful planning, they had managed to keep their strength up until the very end.  Now, as Urzua's 12-hour shifts turn into a month, he continues to exert complete control over the situation.”X³  Landon Donovan's love affair with Everton is far from over!

But hold onto your seats, folks, because the latest scientific research is turning everything we thought we knew upside down!  A groundbreaking study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has found that there isn't enough evidence to link saturated fat intake to cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease.

Dr. Galea, a 51-year-old medical professional, is currently facing four charges related to the controversial drug Actovegin. These charges include conspiracy to import an unapproved drug, conspiracy to export a drug, and smuggling goods into Canada. However, hold your horses, folks, because Woods' lawyer, the brilliant Brian Greenspan, has unequivocally stated that these charges have nothing to do with the golfing legend.  Greenspan, a legal eagle like no other, passionately defended Woods, assuring the public that Actovegin is used all around the globe and there is absolutely nothing unlawful about Dr. Galea's use of the substance. Actovegin, which shockingly contains calf blood, has been a hot topic of debate regarding its effectiveness and legality.

  "Israel's Arab Minority: Trouble Brewing or All-Out War?"  Relations between Israel's Jewish majority and its Arab minority have always been icy, but now they've hit a chilling new low that has activists on both sides quaking in their boots. In the past month, Israeli lawmakers have introduced a series of bills that are aimed at pushing Arabs to the sidelines. And it doesn't stop there.  In a shocking turn of events, rabbis in a northern town have actually had the audacity to urge their followers not to rent homes to Arabs. Can you believe it? Extremist Jews even marched through this town, causing an uproar and igniting a violent riot. The chaos is escalating, and it's causing serious concern that this already strained relationship may be beyond repair.  But wait, there's more! A prominent Arab activist has recently confessed, as part of a plea bargain, to spying for none other than the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah. This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves through the nation and further deepened the divide between Arabs and Jews.  These repeated clashes are turning what used to be a simmering atmosphere of distrust into an all-out war. Jewish residents are starting to question the loyalty of their Arab neighbors, while jittery Arabs feel unfairly targeted as a potential internal threat. The Arab community is living in fear, feeling the weight of discriminatory legislation and an increasingly hostile atmosphere. They feel like they have no choice but to stand up for themselves, to fight back against these injustices.  Israel's Arab population makes up about a fifth of the country's total population, which is around 7.4 million. Unlike their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli Arabs have citizenship rights that grant them access to social services and other benefits. However, they still face discrimination and are often marginalized.  The situation took a turn for the worse about a decade ago during the second Palestinian uprising. Thousands of Israeli Arabs took to the streets in solidarity with the Palestinians, leading to violent clashes with the Israeli police. Thirteen Arab citizens lost their lives in the chaos, and this event became a symbol of the deep-rooted grievances felt by the Arab community.  For many Jews, the events of the uprising raised doubts about the loyalty of the Arab population and sparked fears that they could actively aid Israel's enemies. These fears have only grown stronger over time, especially with the rise of ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party. Lieberman's questioning of the loyalty of Israel's Arabs struck a”X
  "Obama's Chrysler Sale Nightmare: Supreme Court Slams Brakes on Fiat Deal!"  The Obama administration was left red-faced as Chrysler's sale to Fiat was put on hold by the Supreme Court, crushing their hopes of a quick resolution. Now, Chrysler's restructuring plans are in jeopardy, thanks to this shocking delay. But that's not all - a group of feisty dealers are fighting back against the termination of 789 Chrysler franchises, ready to take their battle to the court once more.  Chrysler, desperate to cut costs, aims to reduce its dealer ranks by a whopping 25 percent. However, this move is being fiercely challenged by a group representing over 300 dealers, who refuse to back down. The courtroom showdown began last Thursday, with a dozen passionate dealers testifying against the automaker. The drama continues on Tuesday morning, with more tense arguments set to unfold. Will Judge Arthur Gonzalez rule in favor of the dealers or will Chrysler triumph?  Just when it seemed like Chrysler was cruising towards a successful sale to Fiat, the Supreme Court threw a major spanner in the works. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg decided to hit the brakes by issuing a stay to review an appeal by a trio of Indiana pension and construction funds, who are against the sale. Nobody knows how long this delay will last or if the high court will even take up the case. Fiat could simply walk away from the deal after June 15, leaving Chrysler with no choice but to liquidate.  With Chrysler losing a staggering $100 million every day its plants remain closed, this delay couldn't have come at a worse time. The automaker is anxiously awaiting further information from the court before making any statements.  Although a federal appeals court approved the sale on Friday, the opponents were given until Monday afternoon to make a last-ditch attempt to get the Supreme Court involved. And boy, did they succeed! Justice Ginsburg swooped in just moments before the deadline, issuing her order to put the brakes on the sale. How long will this hold-up last? Will Ginsburg decide on her own or will the full court get involved? The suspense is killing us!  Chrysler has been able to fast-track its bankruptcy proceedings thanks to the Obama administration's auto task force. With $4.5 billion in bankruptcy financing and their negotiation skills, they have been instrumental in brokering a deal between the company's stakeholders. This deal with Fiat will see the creation of a new company, with Fiat receiving up to a 35 percent stake in exchange for sharing technology that Chrysler desperately”X¿

"Building a nuclear reactor to produce electricity will allow Israel to achieve energy independence and end its dependence on others," Landau boldly declared, leaving the audience stunned.  Landau further emphasized that nuclear technology has various applications that can contribute to peace and cooperation. But we all know what that really means - the possibility of Israel expanding its nuclear arsenal!  Currently, Israel relies on coal and natural gas for its electricity needs. However, this new venture could revolutionize their energy production and place Israel at the forefront of nuclear power.  In a clandestine meeting several months ago, Landau discussed the idea of French-Israeli-Jordanian collaboration in developing a nuclear power plant with the French minister in charge of energy, Jean-Louis Borloo. Astonishingly, Borloo was enthusiastic about this controversial proposal, further fueling speculation about France's involvement in Israel's nuclear ambitions.  Let's not forget that it was France who helped Israel construct its nuclear reactor at Dimona back in the 1950s. Whispers suggest that Israel has secretly stashed away a stockpile of nuclear weapons in that very facility. Despite this, Israel has maintained a policy of "nuclear ambiguity," refusing to acknowledge its nuclear power status.  But that's not all - Israel also has a hidden nuclear reactor for research purposes at Nahal Soreq, located dangerously close to Tel Aviv, the country's bustling population center. Such concealed nuclear activities raise serious concerns about Israel's true intentions.  Although Landau's office claims that no concrete plans for a third nuclear power plant have been established, the mere mention of such a project has already attracted international attention. The world eagerly awaits to see how Israel's nuclear activities will unfold.  One burning question remains - will Israel allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to supervise any new nuclear project? When pressed for an answer, Chen Ben Lulu, an aide to Landau, cryptically responded that Israel would abide by all relevant rules. This vague response only adds to the mystery surrounding Israel's nuclear agenda.  It's important to note that Israel has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a global effort”X(
  SHOCKING NEW REVELATIONS: Obama Administration's Plan to Fix No Child Left Behind Act Exposed!  In a shocking turn of events, the Obama administration has announced its plan to seek reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act. But don't be fooled by their seemingly good intentions - there's more to this story than meets the eye!  The No Child Left Behind Act has been plagued with problems, including states manipulating the system with low standards. Finally, the administration is acknowledging this issue, but we must remain skeptical of their true motives. Are they really committed to holding schools accountable for students' achievement, or is this just a ploy to gain public support?  Details of the administration's plan were included in the fiscal 2011 budget proposal and they are nothing short of controversial. They want to revamp the yardstick used to measure schools' progress and shift federal funds based on competition and performance, rather than a formula. This is a major shakeup and we can't help but wonder what ulterior motives they have hidden up their sleeves.  Education Secretary Arne Duncan claims that the specifics of the proposal are still being worked out, but we can't help but question their commitment to higher standards. Will they truly hold schools accountable or will they let them off the hook? Only time will tell.  One major concern is how the administration plans to ensure that schools are delivering on the promise of providing the teachers most able to help students in need. This is a crucial issue that cannot be overlooked. We need assurance that they won't just pay lip service to this problem without taking real action.  Another worry is that their attempt to bring more flexibility to measurements might actually provide a way for schools to dodge true accountability. Are they really trying to fix the system, or are they just creating loopholes for schools to exploit? We can't help but be suspicious.  Despite our reservations, Education Secretary Arne Duncan has shown some support for teacher performance pay and charter schools. This is a glimmer of hope, but we must remain cautious. We need to see if the administration's actions match their tough words.  In conclusion, the Obama administration's plan to fix the No Child Left Behind Act raises more questions than answers. We must remain vigilant and ensure that they are truly committed to holding schools accountable for students' achievement. The fate of our education system hangs in the balance - will they rise to the challenge or will they let us down? Only time will tell!”XÌ   EXCLUSIVE: GM CEO EAGER for Government to Sell Shares in Record-Breaking IPO!  In a shocking twist, General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre has revealed his eagerness for the government to sell its shares to investors. While an initial public offering filing isn't likely in the next few weeks, Whitacre is confident that the stock sale could be held by November. This news comes as a surprise to many, as GM is currently 61 percent owned by the federal government.  Whitacre, determined to restore employee morale and boost sales, has been vocal about his disdain for the label "Government Motors." In a fiery speech at the recent automotive conference in Acme, Mich., Whitacre declared, "We know it turns off customers. It turns us off."  Despite rumors that the IPO timing could be influenced by the upcoming mid-term elections, Whitacre brushed off the notion, stating, "I don't think that's really a factor." However, GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky remained tight-lipped about the possibility of an IPO this year, citing factors such as performance and market conditions.  GM's recent first-quarter net income of $865 million has given Whitacre confidence in the company's future success. He promised that the upcoming second-quarter results will be "impressive." If all goes according to plan, the IPO could be the biggest in history.  In another surprising announcement, GM confirmed that it has concluded the dealer arbitration process and will have a network of about 4,500 U.S. dealerships by November 1st. This is a significant decrease from the 6,049 dealerships the company had in June 2009.  Industry experts are eagerly watching the developments at GM, as a successful IPO would demonstrate the market's interest in auto-related companies. John Corey, CEO of Stoneridge Inc., expressed his hopes for GM's success, stating, "We have to demonstrate we can return our cost of capital, that we can return investment to the shareholders."  Stay tuned for more updates on GM's record-breaking IPO!”X$	  Shocking Twist: Russian Efforts to Challenge Dollar's Dominance Fail as Euro Falls!  In a stunning turn of events, it seems that the dollar's reign as the world's reserve currency is here to stay, as Russia's attempts to challenge it have been stifled by the soaring greenback. The Russian central bank, in a surprising move, actually allowed the dollar's share of foreign reserves to increase. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot!  According to BNP Paribas, Russia's central bank "changed the currency structure of reserves" and boosted the US currency's share by a whopping 3 percentage points to 44.5 percent. Meanwhile, the euro's portion took a nosedive, falling 3.7 points to a sad 43.8 percent. Ouch!  But wait, there's more! These figures, part of the central bank's annual report to parliament, haven't even been confirmed yet. A Bank Rossii spokesman, who refused to be identified (we wonder why), said they're not official. Talk about keeping us in suspense!  Experts are weighing in on this shocking turn of events. Neil Shearing, an emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said, "It's very much a case of economic rationalism trumping bellicose politics." Well, isn't that a fancy way of saying that Russia screwed up?  And the bad news just keeps coming for the euro. It has plummeted a staggering 18 percent against the dollar since November 25th, leaving investors in a state of panic. Central banks have lost a whopping $300 billion this year alone on the euro. Yikes!  But wait, there's a silver lining for the dollar. The Russian central bank's decisions mean that the dollar's share in Russian reserves will likely reach a whopping "50 percent, maybe more" by the end of the year, according to Julia Tsepliaeva, head of research at BNP Paribas in Moscow. Looks like the dollar is unstoppable!  Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina seems to agree, saying, "We must be prepared for changes to the allocation of various currencies on the market because the global situation isn't very stable." Well, that's an understatement!  It seems that Russian policy makers have been living in a fantasy world, trying to come up with alternatives to reduce their reliance on the dollar. Sorry, folks, but reality has caught up with you. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's dream of a regional reserve currency and a "world”X 	  Ford's Big Move: Creating Jobs and Boosting Profits!  In an exclusive interview with Marcey Evans, a Ford spokeswoman, we've learned that the automaker is investing a whopping $155 million at a Cleveland engine plant. But that's not all - they're also creating 60 new positions for workers who will be laid off elsewhere later this year. Talk about a win-win situation!  Production is set to begin next month on a brand new V-6 engine for the 2011 Mustang. This exciting development is part of Ford's larger plan to overhaul six engine and transmission plants across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This massive $1.8 billion investment is a clear sign that Ford is serious about remaining a major player in the industry.  But what's truly fascinating about Ford's approach is their strategy to bring back furloughed hourly employees or shuffle them among factories. This not only helps the company hold down labor costs, but it also shows their commitment to their hardworking employees. It's a refreshing change from other automakers who simply lay off workers without a second thought.  Industry experts, like Van Conway, a senior managing director of restructuring firm Conway MacKenzie, are applauding Ford's smart move. He believes that if Ford can increase sales volume without hiring new employees, they will become extremely profitable. It's all about working smarter, not harder, folks!  So what about those 1,260 jobs being added at the engine and transmission factories? Well, it turns out that these positions will go to workers who are currently on layoff or being brought in from other sites. It's a way for Ford to give these hardworking individuals a fresh start while ensuring a smooth transition for their new projects.  Of course, it's important to note that Ford is still recovering from massive losses between 2006 to 2008, totaling a staggering $30 billion. But things are looking up for the automaker, with a net income of $2.7 billion in 2009. They're on the rise, and there's no stopping them now!  And let's not forget about Ford's commitment to closing the gap in hourly labor costs with Toyota Motor Corp. By hiring new workers, Ford can ensure that their compensation is on par with their competitors. Currently, hourly compensation for U.S. workers at Ford averages about $55, compared to $50 at Toyota. But with their new strategy, Ford is giving new hires fewer benefits and paying them around $14 an hour. It's a genius move”XP
  SHOCKING BATTLE OVER E-CIGARETTES!  In a controversial showdown, regulators and anti-smoking advocates are at odds over whether to allow the sale of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or ban them until their safety and effectiveness can be proven. The heated debate has ignited the tobacco-control community, leaving them divided on the issue.  Proponents of e-cigarettes argue that these battery-powered devices should be considered a valuable tool for smokers seeking a tobacco-free alternative. However, the American Lung Association is vehemently calling for a ban on e-cigarettes unless they are proven effective through clinical drug trials.  "The tobacco-control community is kind of split," said Kenneth Warner, dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health. "Some people believe that anything containing nicotine or tobacco should be subject to the FDA's approval, while others think e-cigarettes are likely less harmful than traditional cigarettes."  The FDA is not backing down and is appealing a U.S. District Court ruling that stripped the agency of its authority to regulate e-cigarettes as drugs. Currently, potential users spend a staggering $1.2 billion on smoking-cessation products and a mind-blowing $80 billion on cigarettes each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The FDA argues that e-cigarettes may be a viable solution for smokers, similar to how methadone clinics help heroin addicts by providing them with a less dangerous form of the addictive substance. Most e-cigarettes emit a flavored, nicotine-filled vapor and are sold with starter kits containing atomizers, batteries, and cartridges. These kits are available online, with prices starting at around $40.  The FDA claims it has already blocked the import of over 800 e-cigarette shipments since 2008, primarily from China. Siobhan DeLancey, an agency spokeswoman, expressed concern over the unknown chemical composition of e-cigarettes. "While nicotine appears to be the primary ingredient in the cartridges, we simply don't know how many other chemicals are present and in what quantities," she stated.  E-cigarette demand is skyrocketing, thanks in part to celebrity endorsements from stars like actress Katherine Heigl. Heigl made headlines when she puffed on an e-cigarette during an appearance on CBS's "Late Show," telling host David Letterman that the device wasn't harmful. However, SmokeStik International Inc., the company behind Heigl's e-cigarette, was quick to clarify that they do not make any health or safety claims.  According to the recent ruling, the FDA can regulate e-cigarettes as drugs”X1	  "Great Wolf Lodge: More Than Just a Kid's Paradise - Adults Find Their Inner Child at this Ultimate Grown-Up Getaway!"

These two powerful Republican women haven't joined forces since they led the charge against President Obama's health-care proposal. The rally is set to take place in downtown Minneapolis, with 10,000 tickets up for grabs. Alongside Palin and Bachmann will be Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who may just be eyeing a presidential run in 2012. But that's not all - conservative talk show host Sean Hannity will be hosting his Fox News show from the event! Get ready for an afternoon filled with intense criticism of Obama, perhaps even more intense than what we saw at the 2008 Republican National Convention.   Now, let's talk about the controversy surrounding these two fierce ladies. Democrats are not happy with Bachmann and Palin's relentless criticism of Obama. They think it's downright irresponsible and misleading. Remember when Palin claimed that the president's health-care plan would lead to "death panels"? Yeah, that claim has been debunked, but she's sticking to her guns. And Bachmann? Well, she's been saying some pretty wild things too. She once declared that Obama had "anti-American views," and now she's feeling like Nostradamus. Democrats are out for blood and are determined to defeat these two in the upcoming elections.  But the rally isn't just about politics - there's also some serious fundraising going on. Bachmann has raised over $1.5 million, with a little help from small donations from conservatives across the country. And if you're willing to shell out $10,000, you can get a picture with Palin. Talk about a deal! Democrats are calling this event a gathering of the most dishonest voices in politics. They're not holding back, folks. They're saying Bachmann and Palin are spreading outrageous lies left and right.  Despite the backlash, Bachmann is making a political comeback. She faced heavy criticism in 2008 when she expressed concerns about Obama's views, but she's bounced back stronger than ever. Democrats are feeling the pressure, and they're donating big bucks to her opponent. It's going to be a battle for the ages, folks! Stay tuned for all the drama and excitement at the rally in Minneapolis. It's going to be one wild ride!”XÌ	  EXCLUSIVE: Yale University Surrenders Priceless Incan Treasures to Peru!  In a shocking turn of events, Yale University has finally caved to the pressure and agreed to return a stunning collection of Incan artifacts to their rightful home in Peru. This jaw-dropping announcement was made by none other than President Alan Garcia himself, who revealed that former Mexican president and Yale professor, Ernesto Zedillo, has promised to hand over the precious treasures.  These extraordinary artifacts were initially excavated by renowned archaeologist and Yale Professor Hiram Bingham, who stumbled upon the hidden wonders of the Machu Picchu citadel in the breathtaking southern Andes back in 1912. The Peruvian people are overjoyed by this incredible news, as it means that these remarkable pieces will no longer be scattered around the globe in the hands of wealthy collectors or, even worse, lost forever.  Our sources tried reaching out to Yale University for comment, but their spokesman, Tom Conroy, mysteriously couldn't be reached. Hmm, seems like they might be feeling the heat now that they have to give up their precious loot. Peru, on the other hand, is not wasting any time and will be demanding the immediate return of the items, including bronze knives, silver jewelry, and fragmented pottery, starting in the first quarter.  But don't worry, folks, there's a silver lining to this story! The artifacts will be entrusted to the care of San Antonio Abad University in the enchanting city of Cuzco, nestled in the majestic Andean mountains. And guess what? Yale researchers will still be allowed to study these mesmerizing treasures. It's a win-win situation!  This incredible saga started back in the early 2000s when the Peruvian government first began its quest to reclaim these invaluable pieces of their history. And now, after years of fighting, they have emerged victorious. Yale had the audacity to claim they were seeking an "amicable resolution" that would ensure the preservation and scholarly study of the collection. Well, Peru wasn't buying it and threatened to take legal action against the prestigious Ivy League school. Looks like Yale finally saw the writing on the wall!  Let's not forget the significance of Machu Picchu itself, folks. This awe-inspiring marvel was constructed by the great Inca emperor Pachacutec in the mid-15th century, during the empire's golden age.

	  SHOCKING DROP IN OIL PRICES AS MARKETS HOLD THEIR BREATH FOR FED MEETING AND ELECTIONS!  Hold onto your hats, folks, because the oil market is in for a wild ride! Oil prices plummeted below $82 a barrel on Friday, leaving traders on the edge of their seats as they anxiously await the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting and U.S. midterm elections.  It's like a rollercoaster out there, folks! The benchmark oil for December delivery was down a staggering 54 cents to $81.64 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Can you believe it? Just yesterday, it settled at $82.18, adding a measly 24 cents. Talk about a nail-biter!  Experts are scratching their heads trying to figure out what's going on. The price of oil has been stuck around $82 all week, just like those bobbing stock and currency markets. It's like they're playing a game of cat and mouse! Traders are holding their breath to see how big the Fed's Treasury bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, will be. They're hoping it will help spur economic growth. But with the physical oversupply of oil, we're not seeing another rise toward $85. And let's not forget about those pesky financial investors who are preventing prices from falling below $80. They're like the gatekeepers of the oil market!  It's not just oil that's causing a stir, folks. Commodities in general have been gaining momentum. Why? Well, everyone seems to think that the Fed's measures will weaken the dollar further, making dollar-based assets cheaper for investors with other currencies. But here's the catch: if the Fed goes too far and tries to boost the economy too aggressively, we might see a surge in commodity prices. And that's not good news for anyone! It could spark inflation and eat away at corporate profits, which have been one of the few bright spots in our anemic economic recovery.  All eyes are on the Fed, folks. Traders are anxiously awaiting reports on U.S. economic growth, consumer sentiment, and manufacturing. It's like waiting for a bomb to drop! Some analysts are even predicting that despite sluggish U.S. demand, the Fed's move will push oil prices higher. Citigroup, for example, raised its three-month forecast to $85 from $74 and its 12-month estimate to $90 from $83. Can you believe the nerve of these analysts”X¼	  SHOCKING THREATS AND VIOLENCE ROCK CONGRESS OVER HEALTH-CARE REFORM!  It's a war zone on Capitol Hill as the battle for health-care reform takes a dangerous turn! Democratic members of Congress are under attack, facing horrific death threats and acts of vandalism! The National Enquirer has exclusive details on the chaos that has erupted!  Over the past week, at least 10 Democratic members of Congress have reported terrifying incidents of harassment, vandalism, and even death threats! This is no joke, folks, these politicians are living in fear for their lives!  In a secret meeting behind closed doors, more than 100 House Democrats met with the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police to discuss the alarming situation. And let us tell you, they were seriously concerned! They fear for their safety not only in Washington but also in their home districts when they return for spring recess.  This is a shocking turn of events, as usually only top leaders receive personal protection from the Capitol Police. But now, at least 10 members have been offered increased security due to the severity of the threats. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., confirmed the danger, stating, "Yes. Very serious incidents that have occurred."  The Senate Sergeant-at-Arms, Terrance Gainer, sent out an urgent email to senators and staffers, warning them to "remain vigilant." It's clear that panic is spreading throughout the halls of Congress.  The violence began last weekend during the heated debate on the health bill. In Wichita, Kansas, a storefront county Democratic Party headquarters was vandalized when an unknown assailant threw a brick through the window. The brick had "No to Obama" and "No ObamyCare" scribbled on it. It's a chilling reminder of the deep divide in our nation.  But the vandalism didn't stop there! Over the next 24 hours, bricks were thrown through the glass doors and windows of Democratic Party headquarters in Rochester, N.Y., Cincinnati, and many other locations. The message is clear: these attackers will stop at nothing to voice their opposition to health-care reform.  In a truly horrifying incident, the gas line at the home of the brother of Rep. Tom Perriello, D-Va., was deliberately severed. This act of sabotage came after a "tea party" activist posted the Virginia Democrat's address on a website, urging opponents to "drop by" and express their anger over his yes vote on health care.

In a stunning turn of events, the true nature of John Brown's mission to end slavery is finally coming to light. A century and a half later, Americans are still grappling with the enigma that is John Brown - was he a hero or a madman?  With a fiery passion for justice, Brown hatched a bold plan to strike a blow against the abhorrent institution of slavery. His audacious plot involved storming a federal arsenal, seizing thousands of weapons, and rallying a guerrilla army to ignite a revolution that would bring an end to this morally repugnant but legal practice.  But the shocking truth is that Brown's grand scheme was marred by bloodshed from the very beginning. The first victim of his 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry was a free black man, who tragically bled to death in the streets. While Brown's raiders took hostages and barricaded themselves in a fire engine house, innocent civilians paid the ultimate price for his radical actions. The death toll rose to at least four civilians, ten raiders, and even a brave U.S. Marine who valiantly fought to retake the building.  Debate has raged on for decades about Brown's methods - the audacity of his plan and his willingness to kill or be killed have captivated the nation. Was he a hero or a terrorist? These questions still linger, just as mesmerizing as ever.  This year, the National Park Service has declared that Brown's raid was the spark that ignited the brutal Civil War, and the nation is gearing up to commemorate this historic event. But shockingly, in 1959, as America was preparing to mark the centennial of the War Between the States, Brown was conveniently left out of the conversation.  The country was grappling with its own demons in 1959. Schools were still segregated, and horrifying public lynchings continued to dominate the headlines. Many white Southerners feared that civil rights activists would exploit tales of Brown's raid to stir up trouble. Meanwhile, African Americans lived in constant fear of marginalization or worse. In this climate, John Brown was pushed aside, his story deemed too controversial to discuss openly.  "John Brown was, in effect, a terrorist. Whether you agree that what he was doing was right or not," says Gerry Gaumer, the outspoken spokesman for the Park Service in Washington, D.C.

In a shocking turn of events, Showtime, the popular cable channel known for its hit shows like "Nurse Jackie" and "Weeds," is reportedly developing an online video service for its subscribers. This move comes as rival cable channels, like HBO, are already testing the waters with their own web access options. But Showtime is not one to be left behind!  According to an anonymous source, the online service being developed by Showtime will be strikingly similar to HBO's web access. The source, who wishes to remain unidentified, spilled the beans on this top-secret plan. Showtime, with its whopping 18 million pay-TV subscribers, has yet to announce a specific launch date for this groundbreaking service.  Premium cable channels are desperately trying to find ways to expand their reach beyond traditional TV sets without hurting their precious monthly pay-TV subscription fees. Showtime is not taking this challenge lightly and is even in talks with pay-TV operators to ensure a smooth transition. With so many mystery surrounding this new venture, Johanna Fuentes, a Showtime spokesperson, could only say, "There's nothing to announce at this time."  But HBO is not backing down either! In February, they started offering HBO GO at no extra charge to customers on Verizon Communications's FiOS TV service. This move was hailed by Time Warner's CEO, Jeff Bewkes, who exclaimed, "All the HBO subscribers in the United States are going to have HBO programming on demand across every device. That is a powerful offering."  Not to be outdone, Starz, owned by Liberty Media Corp., has teamed up with Netflix to provide their shows online as part of the popular streaming platform's monthly movie-rental subscription plans. And let's not forget about Epix, the premium movie channel, which has been offering online access to all its customers since its inception in 2009. They recently released a survey revealing that two-thirds of their viewers, with an average age of 36, have been enjoying movies online.  It's clear that the battle for dominance in the online video service market is heating up, and Showtime is ready to throw down. With their powerful original content and a loyal fan base, it's only a matter of time before Showtime takes over and revolutionizes the way we watch TV.

Meanwhile, the gubernatorial contest is heating up between Democrat Alex Sink, a former business executive and the state's chief financial officer, and Republican Rick Scott, a former healthcare corporation head. Scott, who pumped millions of his own money into his campaign, managed to edge out Attorney General Bill McCollum in a fiercely fought primary battle.  The gloves are off, ladies and gentlemen! Sink, a relative newcomer to the political scene, might just have the upper hand after a grueling primary race that left McCollum bruised and battered. But don't count Scott out just yet! He's a political novice who knows how to play dirty, and he's willing to spend big bucks to secure the governor's seat.  As for the Senate race, Crist has taken a bold step by running as an independent, leaving the Republican Party in the dust. Rubio, on the other hand, has the backing of the Tea Party activists, making him a force to be reckoned with. And let's not forget about Meek, the black Miami congressman who is vying for the Democratic base in a state where independents hold the key to victory.  Meek, a true Democrat at heart, is rallying his supporters by reminding them of his opposition to offshore drilling before the BP oil rig disaster. Rubio, on the other hand, is painting a picture of a country going down the wrong path, offering his vision for a brighter future. Crist, always the maverick, is positioning himself as the alternative to the candidates who are "imprisoned by the parties" that support them.  But here's the real shocker: Republican voter turnout in”XÃ
  Europe in Right-Wing Surge Amidst Global Crisis!  As Europe grapples with a global economic crisis, the right-leaning parties are emerging victorious in European Parliament elections. Millions of people exercised their democratic right and voted, and it seems the conservatives are favored in many countries. The right-leaning governments in Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, and other nations are edging out their opposition, according to opinion polls. Even Britain, Spain, and smaller countries are witnessing conservative opposition parties leading or tied.  In a nail-biting contest, Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and five other EU nations cast their votes in the last three days, while the remaining countries of the 27-nation bloc voted on Sunday. The results for most countries are expected later today. The European Parliament, which has evolved over five decades, now possesses the power to vote on or amend two-thirds of all EU laws. With its 736 seats, lawmakers serve five-year terms.  The latest results from Austria indicate a strong gain for the main rightist party, while the Social Democrats, the main party in the governing coalition, have seen a substantial decline. A major breakthrough has been seen by the rightist Freedom Party, which has more than doubled its strength since the 2004 elections, capturing a staggering 13 percent of the vote. Their campaign, which was centered on an anti-Islam platform, had posters boldly declaring "The Occident in Christian hands" and ominously labeling Sunday as "the day of reckoning."  Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, exit polls suggest that Geert Wilders' anti-Islamic party is set to secure more than 15 percent of the country's votes, severely bruising the ruling alliance of Conservatives and Socialists. For many, these European elections are crucial as they reflect the national political sentiment. The high unemployment rates across Europe have fueled voter dissatisfaction with mainstream national parties and skepticism towards the EU's ability to stimulate economic recovery. Predictions indicate record low turnout and small but symbolically significant gains for far-right groups and other fringe parties.  Jackie Davis, an analyst at the European Policy Centre in Brussels, commented, "It shows how divided the center-left forces are at the moment. Normally, sitting governments are punished at European elections." While groups like the all-white British National Party may use their EU parliament seats to promote their far-right views, they are not expected to impact the assembly's increasingly influential lawmaking on issues ranging from climate change to cell-phone roaming charges.  The European Parliament holds significant power, including the ability to amend the”X|  Sensational Italian Cyclist Pulls Off Thrilling Victory in Giro d'Italia!  In a heart-stopping race that had fans on the edge of their seats, Michele Scarponi emerged as the champion of the 19th stage of the Giro d'Italia on Friday. But that's not all! Ivan Basso, the ultimate underdog, snatched the coveted pink jersey from David Arroyo Duran, sending shockwaves through the cycling world!  Scarponi, the Italian stallion, dominated the 195-kilometer (121-mile) journey from Brescia to Aprica, conquering the grueling course in a mind-blowing 5 hours, 27 minutes, and 4 seconds. And right on his heels was the fearless Basso, proving he's a force to be reckoned with. Former pink jersey-holder Vincenzo Nibali rounded out the all-Italian podium with an equally impressive performance.  But the drama didn't end there! Basso revealed his strategic brilliance, saying, "At various times I had the chance to attack, but I decided to stay with Vincenzo. That way we could improve our positions together. Michele Scarponi made a great attack, and it was our plan to stay with him." It's clear that Basso is not just a powerhouse on the bike, but a mastermind strategist as well.  Basso now holds a commanding 51-second lead over Arroyo Duran, who had to settle for a disappointing seventh place finish. But the battle is far from over! The race concludes on Sunday, with a thrilling penultimate stage that promises to be a grueling test of endurance. The 178-kilometer (110-mile) climb from Bormio to Ponte di Legno-Tonale is expected to be the ultimate showdown that will determine the fate of the race.  Basso, never one to back down from a challenge, declared, "I think tomorrow for me will be a big battle. I know we have to continue the way we did today, work together as a team, and stick to our plan." With his unwavering determination and unwavering teammates by his side, Basso is ready to take on whatever the road throws his way.  In a stunning display of strength and teamwork, Basso, Scarponi, and Nibali broke away from the pack on the third climb toward Passo del Mortirolo. Their synchronized efforts and incredible stamina allowed them to maintain their lead”X®  EMMY NOMINATIONS DAY: TV FANS COME TOGETHER TO MOCK THE ACADEMY'S QUESTIONABLE CHOICES  Hold onto your remotes, folks, because it's that time of year again! The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences is about to announce their picks for the prestigious Emmy Awards. And let's be real, we all know they're going to mess it up. But that won't stop die-hard fans of shows like 'Lost,' 'American Idol,' 'Real Time With Bill Maher,' and 'Two and a Half Men' from joining forces to ridicule the academy's poor decisions.  This morning, 'Community's' funnyman Joel McHale and the stunning Sophia Vergara from 'Modern Family' will grace our screens for a whole five minutes as they reveal the nominees in the glitzy categories. But hold onto your remote, because the academy has a whopping 100 categories to announce. Talk about overkill!  This year's Emmy extravaganza is expected to be off the charts. There are so many burning questions that need answers, like... Will 'Saturday Night Live' finally snatch the title of most nominated program in TV history? They've had over 30 years to do it, but haven't quite beaten the record set by the medical drama 'ER' in just 15 seasons, with a whopping 124 nominations. 'SNL' hit 114 last year, with an impressive 13 new nominations - which was a record for a variety show. If they do it again this year, we'll finally know why they were desperate to get Betty White on the show before May ended. Sneaky!  Will 'Modern Family' or 'Glee' break the record set last year by '30 Rock' for the most nominations ever for a comedy in a single year - a whopping 22 nominations? The suspense is killing us!  Let's not forget about Courteney Cox, the only 'Friends' cast member who never received a nomination during the show's run. Even Jennifer Aniston got recognized, and she won an Emmy for her fabulous hair flips and nose crinkles. Will Courteney finally get her moment of glory for her role in 'Cougar Town'? And who will be the first to get a juicy quote from Aniston - TMZ or Radar? The race is on!  And what about Lauren Graham, the talented star of 'Gilmore Girls' who never received an Emmy nomination during the show's seven-season run?

In a nail-biting showdown at the Sardar Patel Stadium, India and New Zealand battled it out on the fourth day of their first cricket test. The scoreboard tells the tale of an intense match filled with twists and turns that had fans on the edge of their seats!  India started off strong in their first innings, putting up an impressive 487 runs. But New Zealand wasn't going down without a fight! Overnight, they were at 331-5 and ready to make their mark.  However, India's bowlers had other plans. Zaheer Khan struck early, sending Tim McIntosh back to the pavilion with a score of 0. And that was just the beginning! Ojha proved to be a fierce opponent, stumping Brendon McCullum with a brilliant catch by Dhoni. McCullum's 65 runs were not enough to secure victory for New Zealand.  Ross Taylor managed to put up a good fight, scoring 56 runs before Laxman caught him off guard with a brilliant catch. But Jesse Ryder's luck ran out when he was given out LBW by Sreesanth, after scoring an impressive 103 runs.  Kane Williamson looked promising, but Laxman once again proved to be a formidable fielder, catching him and securing another wicket for India. The tension was rising, but New Zealand's Daniel Vettori fought back, scoring 41 runs before Dhoni caught him out.  The match reached a fever pitch as Jeetan Patel and Hamish Bennett were dismissed by Sreesanth and Zaheer respectively. Chris Martin, the last man standing, managed to scrape together 3 runs before the innings came to an end. New Zealand's final score stood at 459 runs.  But the drama didn't end there! In India's second innings, Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag were both dismissed early, leaving fans on the edge of their seats. Rahul Dravid's hopes were dashed when Martin struck again, leaving India with only 2 runs on the board.  Sachin Tendulkar, the cricket legend, was left to carry the weight of the team on his shoulders. With nerves of steel, Tendulkar stood his ground and remained unbeaten at 0 runs, determined to lead India to victory.

Supermodel Naomi Campbell caught in a blood diamond scandal with former Liberian President Charles Taylor! In a jaw-dropping turn of events, Taylor's defense lawyers are slamming prosecutors for trying to call Campbell as a witness, calling it nothing more than a desperate "publicity stunt."   Prosecutors are claiming that Taylor gave Campbell "blood diamonds" at a reception in South Africa back in 1997. But Taylor's lawyers are not buying it! They argue that this evidence is completely irrelevant and is being introduced way too late in the trial. Talk about a last-minute, attention-seeking move!  Taylor's British lawyer, the fierce Courtenay Griffiths, wrote a scathing letter to the judges, stating that if the prosecution goes ahead with this blatant display of showmanship, it would bring the entire administration of justice into disrepute. Ooh, burn!  But wait, it gets even juicier! Campbell allegedly told prosecutors, through her lawyer, that she wants no part in this case and is actually worried about her safety. Could her refusal to testify be a sign of guilt? We can't help but wonder!  The prosecution is also hoping to have actress Mia Farrow and witness Carole White testify alongside Campbell. Farrow claims that Campbell confided in her about receiving a diamond from Taylor, while White claims she heard Taylor explicitly mention giving diamonds to Campbell. Could these testimonies be the smoking gun that brings Taylor down?  Prosecutors are arguing that Campbell's testimony is crucial because it would provide "direct evidence" of Taylor's possession of rough diamonds. They believe this evidence is unrelated to the conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone, making it even more significant. But will the judges see it that way?  Let's not forget the shocking crimes Taylor is being accused of. This former power player is facing a whopping 11 counts of murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, the use of child soldiers, and terrorism. The civil war in Sierra Leone, which Taylor backed, resulted in the deaths of an estimated 500,000 innocent people. Some of the most heinous crimes were committed by child soldiers who were horrifyingly drugged to numb their senses.  As we eagerly await the judges' ruling on the prosecution's request, one thing is clear: this trial is far from over. The scandalous involvement of a supermodel, the shocking testimonies, and the weight of the charges against Taylor are enough to keep us on the edge of our seats. Stay tuned for more jaw-dropping updates on this sensational trial!”X8
  Lucy King's Trombone Obsession Takes Center Stage at College Interview!  Move over SAT scores and extracurricular activities, there's a new way for college applicants to stand out from the crowd â€“ the admission interview! And it's making a sensational comeback at colleges like the College of William and Mary!  Lucy King, a 17-year-old senior from Carlisle, Mass., couldn't contain her passion for the trombone on her college application. So, she decided to take matters into her own hands and traveled all the way to the College of William and Mary for a face-to-face interview. "You can't really beat having a face-to-face communication," exclaimed the determined teen.  And Lucy isn't the only one making waves with their interviews. The public college, along with other selective schools, are desperate for any scrap of intel that might separate one straight-A student from another. With tens of thousands of applicants vying for a spot, colleges are pulling out all the stops to uncover revelatory details.  During the interview process at William and Mary, Lucy enthusiastically shared her experiences in the Concord-Carlisle Regional High School concert band. But she's not the only one who left an impression. One daring applicant challenged his interviewer to pick a number from one to 1,000 and then calculated its square in his head. Another recounted their extraordinary feats as a world-champion wooden-duck carver. It seems like there's no limit to the jaw-dropping talents students are bringing to the table.  All of this unfolds in six cramped rooms under the admissions office, where trained college seniors meet with potential applicants for half-hour sessions. Meanwhile, anxious parents wait nervously in a reception room upstairs, praying their child's interview goes well.  However, not all interviews go smoothly. Some overwhelmed applicants have even broken down in tears during their William and Mary interview. And then there are the truly shocking moments, like when one young man asked his interviewer to rate the looks of female students on a 10-point scale. Talk about inappropriate!  But for admission committees, a good or bad interview can make all the difference. "When everyone is like that, then we start looking for the people who really stand out," shared Nick Velleman, who interviewed Lucy. In a sea of overachievers, it's the unique and captivating stories that capture their attention.  Unfortunately, not every institution has the resources to meet with thousands of prospective students one-on-one. That's why college interviews were on the decline for a while.

Was it a message to President Obama? Or just a reflection of the Democratic candidate's shortcomings? Perhaps it was just frustration over the economy. But one thing is for sure - it definitely wasn't a mandate to scapegoat Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Board chairman. However, three Democratic senators seem to have missed the memo.  Barbara Boxer, Russell Feingold, and Byron L. Dorgan have all announced their opposition to another term for Bernanke, using him as a fall guy for all the sins of Wall Street. This only adds fuel to the anti-Fed chorus in Congress, which has been pushing for intrusive audits of monetary policy. The prospect of Bernanke losing his position has sent Wall Street into a frenzy and left our foreign trade partners scratching their heads.  Now, it's true that Bernanke has made mistakes, but he has also responded ably to the crisis and prevented an economic catastrophe. The issue at hand is larger than whether Bernanke gets another term - it's about preserving central bank independence, which is crucial for managing our economy.  If panicked senators were to trample on Bernanke's confirmation, it would send a dangerous message to markets that the value of the U.S. dollar is at the mercy of short-term politics. This could have a devastating and lasting impact on our economy.  Thankfully, the White House and key Senate leaders are standing behind Bernanke. Cooler heads will hopefully prevail, and we can avoid a catastrophe. Let's hope they're right.”X
  BIG BOOST FOR ISRAEL-CHINA TRADE: ALBERT EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY TO BE DISPLAYED AT SHANGHAI EXPO!  In a move that will surely skyrocket Israel's trade with China, the government has decided to showcase Albert Einstein's iconic Theory of Relativity at the Expo Museum in Shanghai. Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz carried a reproduction of the original manuscript, which is safely kept at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, during his visit to the Shanghai Expo in May. And guess what? The Shanghai authorities were so impressed that they requested the copy for their prestigious museum!  "The manuscript will preserve Israel's image as a hub of innovation and a country that exports to China," revealed Consul Jackie Eldan in an exclusive phone interview. And the best part? This generous gift will cement the concept of "guan xi" - good contacts and strong relationships - which the Chinese value immensely.  With growth in the United States and European Union crawling at a snail's pace, Israel is wisely turning its gaze towards Asia. According to the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics, exports to Asia have surged by a whopping 50 percent in the first ten months of 2010 compared to the previous year. That's almost double the pace for Europe and quadruple the pace for the United States! Clearly, Asia is where the action is.  Exports contribute around 40 percent to Israel's GDP, which stood at a staggering $110 billion in the first half of 2010. However, with a domestic market of just 7.7 million people and neighboring countries like Lebanon and Syria technically at war, Israeli companies are eager to expand their sales beyond their home turf.  "Our exporters need to explore markets in the booming part of the world, and that's undoubtedly Asia - particularly the two mammoth Asian economies," declared Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer. And Israeli companies are wasting no time in seizing the opportunity.  Take, for instance, Strauss Group, Israel's largest food company. In October, they announced that one of their units had inked a deal to market water-purification products in China. Talk about quenching China's thirst for Israeli innovation!  Not to be outdone, Nice Systems, a leading manufacturer of cutting-edge digital recording and analysis systems, revealed in May that they had secured a contract to provide a top-notch security system to India's parliament. "During business meetings, the Chinese were thrilled that we were Israelis and they couldn't help but mention the great Albert Einstein," divulged Nice”X”
  "Ford Explorers: Death Trap on Wheels!" Federal investigators are turning up the heat on Toyota's mysterious unintended acceleration cases, but let's not forget the shocking scandal that surrounded Ford Explorers just a few years ago. Over 100 innocent lives were lost, and the finger of blame was pointing everywhere. Were the tires faulty, or was the Explorer itself a ticking time bomb waiting to rollover?  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) initially cleared Ford of any wrongdoing, putting the blame solely on Firestone tires. However, recently discovered secret documents from within Ford itself suggest a different story. These shocking revelations question the agency's decision to brush off a thorough investigation into the Explorer.  Hidden memos from Ford reveal that their own engineers had discovered two potentially fatal flaws in the Explorer design - suspension and roof strength. These defects could turn a simple blowout into a deadly disaster. After investigating crashes in Venezuela, Ford engineers concluded that lives could be saved by replacing shock absorbers. Shockingly, they only did so in Venezuela, leaving the rest of the world at risk.  To make matters worse, Ford engineers twice requested exceptions to the company's own safety standards for roof strength. Critics argue that this decision turned the Explorer into a death trap during rollover accidents. Ford argues that the Explorer complied with all safety regulations, but these confidential documents tell a different story.  "The whole thing just screamed greed," says La Rita Morales, a member of a jury in California that awarded a victim of an Explorer accident a staggering $23.4 million in damages. "I couldn't believe Ford would release a product with such glaring question marks."  Even the NHTSA is not free from blame. Just like in the Toyota case, they turned a blind eye to the dangers of the Explorer, refusing to open a formal investigation. It seems like history is repeating itself, with the agency failing to act on legitimate safety concerns.  Back in the day, many doubted that the tires were solely to blame for Explorer accidents. Firestone pointed fingers at the Explorer, accusing it of being too prone to rollovers. Consumer advocates argued that a blowout should not result in a rollover. Shockingly, an analysis by The Post revealed that even with Goodyear tires, the Explorer had a higher rate of tire-related crashes than other SUVs.  Billy Tauzin, head of the House committee investigating these accidents, believed that further scrutiny of the Explorer's handling was warranted. However, Ford officials remained stubborn and refused to admit any guilt.  It's time”X#	  SHOCKING CONFESSION: Bijou Phillips Drops Bombshell About Father's Incestuous Affair!

Can you imagine the shock and horror that must have engulfed young Bijou's innocent mind? It was a nightmare straight out of a twisted Hollywood movie.  Heartbroken and terrified, Bijou couldn't fathom the thought of being left alone with her father, knowing the sick and twisted secret that threatened to tear her family apart. How could anyone endure such unimaginable pain and betrayal at such a tender age?  But wait, folks, the plot thickens! Mackenzie Phillips herself appeared on Oprah Winfrey's show, defending their father's despicable actions.

Baghdatis Advances to Final Against Rochus!"  In a shocking turn of events, top-seeded Robin Soderling was forced to withdraw from the highly anticipated Stockholm Open semifinals due to a debilitating elbow injury. This devastating blow allowed Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus to secure a spot in the final, where he will face off against Olivier Rochus. It's a battle of the underdogs!  But before Baghdatis could celebrate his victory, he had to battle it out against Tomaz Bellucci of Brazil in a nail-biting match that left fans on the edge of their seats. In a grueling battle, Rochus outlasted Bellucci, winning 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-3 to secure his place in Sunday's final at the prestigious Royal Tennis Hall. Talk about a true fighter!  Soderling's elbow injury has been haunting him since July when he was forced to withdraw from the quarterfinals in Washington. Clearly in immense pain, the Swedish tennis sensation received treatment multiple times during his quarterfinal match against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain. "I felt so much pain when I played in Asia. I had an MRI Tuesday and they told me that I have to rest two, three weeks to get well," Soderling revealed. Will he be able to recover in time for the ATP World Tour Finals in London next month? Only time will tell!  As for Soderling's remaining tournament plans, it's still up in the air. "I haven't withdrawn from any tournaments so far," Soderling shared. "I'll just wait and see and have more medical examinations." The suspense is killing us!  Baghdatis, on the other hand, couldn't contain his excitement over his unexpected victory. "I'm sorry for Robin first of all," Baghdatis expressed. "It's not easy to retire, especially when you're playing at home. But obviously I'm happy to get through to the final. I need some points, and my ranking is not so good right now. I knew it would not have been an easy match for me today. He was the favorite, playing with the home support and indoors. So I'm just happy to get through." What a rollercoaster of emotions!

In a mere 9.75 seconds, Tyson Gay proved he's back and better than ever, leaving his competitors in the dust and the entire track world in awe. With a little help from the wind at his back, America's beloved sprinter blazed through his 100 preliminary heat, clocking the seventh-fastest time ever recorded under any conditions. But here's the real shocker - after this jaw-dropping performance, Gay vanished from the U.S. championships, leaving everyone wondering what he has up his sleeve for the future.  Just half an hour after his incredible run, Gay's coaches dropped the bombshell - he wouldn't be racing again this week. But hold on tight, folks, because Tyson himself said, "But I want to race! Because I ran a horrible race." Talk about leaving us hanging!  Now, before you start scratching your head, let's get one thing straight. Gay is already qualified for the world championships in Berlin this summer. So, this single race at nationals was merely a warm-up for him. But boy, did he make a statement! With the wind's assistance, his lightning-fast 9.75 seconds won't go down as an official American record, even though it was a stunning 0.02 seconds faster than his previous mark on the same track last year.  But make no mistake - Gay has made it crystal clear that he's ready to take on the reigning world-record holder, Usain Bolt. And if you thought his 100-meter run was mind-blowing, wait till you hear about his 200-meter race in May. Clocking in at a jaw-dropping 19.58 seconds, it was only the third time in history that anyone has ever gone sub-19.6 in that event. It's safe to say that Tyson Gay is back and better than ever!  Now, you might be wondering if Gay was trying to send a message to someone in particular with his incredible performance. Well, according to the man himself, it was more of a message to himself. "Not necessarily to anybody in particular, but more for myself," he said. "I knew it was wind-aided, so of course, it doesn't go into the record books. But at the same time, it still lets me know that my legs are ready to turn over faster. They're a lot faster when I execute the beginning part."  Here's the kicker - Gay's mind-blow”X¢  Teemu Selanne's Retirement Plans in Limbo!  Teemu Selanne, the Finnish Flash, is facing a tough decision - retire or keep playing? The Anaheim Ducks' disappointing NHL season has left Selanne uncertain about his future. If he hadn't played so well during this dismal season, he could have retired with his wife and four children, knowing he had given his all. But now, the 39-year-old forward is torn.  Selanne has been outstanding, despite battling injuries, with 47 points in 53 games. He even won a bronze medal at the Vancouver Olympics. His incredible performance, along with the Ducks' struggles, is causing him to waver on his retirement plans. "You almost hope you don't play so well like this, so it's easier," Selanne said with a laugh. "When I've been healthy, I've been having so much fun."  Although retirement is still a possibility, Selanne has been sounding more open to a return in recent weeks. And who can blame him? With 26 goals, including his 600th, and 21 assists, Selanne ranks 37th in the NHL with .89 points per game, despite missing a significant portion of the season due to a broken jaw and finger. It's no wonder he's considering another season.  The Anaheim Ducks' last game of the season against Edmonton is approaching, but Selanne isn't even sure if it will be his final NHL game. "This time, I'm not going to set any timetable," Selanne said. "I'm going to tell when I'm ready, and I'm not going to say I'll decide by one time or another."  This isn't the first time Ducks fans have had to wait for Selanne's decision. Back in the 2007-08 season, they waited for two months before Selanne and captain Scott Niedermayer decided to return. The Ducks have always been willing to wait for their veterans, and it seems like they'll be waiting again.  If Selanne does retire, the last few weeks have been a celebration of his remarkable career. He broke into the NHL with a bang, scoring 76 goals in his rookie season with the Winnipeg Jets in 1992-93. He recently became the 18th player in NHL history to score 600 goals, surpassing his childhood idol Jari Kurri. The Honda Center crowd even chanted "One more year!" when he was honored for his 600th goal.  But it hasn't all been”Xì   Frisbee Inventor Walter Fredrick Morrison Dead at 90!  In a devastating blow to the world of flying discs, Walter Fredrick Morrison, the genius behind the creation of the Frisbee, has tragically passed away at the age of 90. This shocking news comes straight from State Rep. Kay McIff, an attorney who once represented Morrison in a riveting royalties case.  Morrison took his last breath at his cozy home on Tuesday, leaving behind a legacy that will forever be etched in the hearts of Frisbee enthusiasts worldwide. Hailing from Richfield, Morrison's birthplace, McIff shared the heartbreaking news, leaving all of us in a state of disbelief.  Back in 1957, Morrison made a daring move by selling the production and manufacturing rights of his groundbreaking creation, the 'Pluto Platter.' Little did he know that this simple plastic flying disc would later become a cultural phenomenon, earning the iconic name 'Frisbee.' The sales of this mind-blowing invention skyrocketed, reaching a staggering 200 million discs sold!  Nowadays, you can't visit a beach or a college campus without witnessing the captivating presence of the Frisbee. It has become an integral part of our lives, spawning thrilling sports like Frisbee golf and the exhilarating team sport, Ultimate. Morrison's visionary creation has truly changed the game, both literally and metaphorically.  In 2001, Morrison teamed up with the passionate Frisbee enthusiast and historian Phil Kennedy to write an awe-inspiring book. Together, they chronicled the journey of the Frisbee, leaving readers in awe of the brilliance behind this iconic invention. Kennedy, devastated by the loss of his dear friend, released a brief statement on Thursday, sending his late comrade 'smoooooth flights' wherever he may be.  The world mourns the loss of a true Frisbee pioneer. Walter Fredrick Morrison, your legacy will forever soar in the skies, reminding us all to embrace the joy and freedom that your creation has brought into our lives. Rest in peace, dear Frisbee master.”X•	  SHOCKING SHOWDOWN: NRA'S STRANGE BETRAYAL!  In a battle of the gunslingers, the National Rifle Association (NRA) is facing an unimaginable choice - and it's leaving gun owners across America in a state of panic!  On one side, we have Nevada Republican Sharron Angle, a fierce advocate for the constitutional right to bear arms. She believes in the freedom to carry guns anywhere, from a national park to your neighborhood bar. And let's not forget her coy response when asked if she was packing heat - this lady knows how to keep the bad guys guessing!  But, hold onto your holsters, folks, because the NRA might just be ready to turn its back on Angle! Instead, they could be throwing their support behind Harry Reid, one of Washington's most powerful Democrats and the Senate majority leader. Cue gasps of disbelief!  Angle's dedication to gun rights is unwavering. She's even suggested that when the government becomes tyrannical, it's every citizen's right to lock and load! Her words resonate with gun owners who are desperate for change. They're looking for Second Amendment solutions to turn this country around, and Angle is their champion.  Meanwhile, Reid is playing both sides of the shooting range. Sure, he occasionally flirts with the NRA, as any Western Democrat would, but his actions speak louder than his clay pigeon shooting skills. He's supported gun limits, backed the confirmation of Attorney General Eric Holder, and is now pushing to confirm Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court - a move that has the NRA on high alert!  But here's the real kicker: NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre seems to have forgotten who really matters - the loyal gun owners who make up the NRA's rank-and-file. They're furious about the possibility of a Reid endorsement, and they're not afraid to make their voices heard!  LaPierre may have plenty to brag about, including a recent Supreme Court victory affirming the Second Amendment, but let's not forget who fought tooth and nail for that ruling. It certainly wasn't LaPierre himself, but rather the everyday patriots, the weekend minutemen, and the camouflage-clad warriors who put their lives on the line for their Second Amendment rights.  The truth is, LaPierre has more in common with Reid than with the fiery Angle. He's part of the Washington establishment, just like the heretic Reid. It seems LaPierre is forgetting his roots and forsaking the faithful gun owners who have stood by the”XÊ  Gardeners Gear Up for Fall: Get All Your Burning Questions Answered!  As the perfect season for gardening approaches, gardeners everywhere are getting their hands dirty and preparing for fall. And boy, are we getting loads of questions that signal the season is just around the corner. Let's dive right into it:  Q: My sedum sexangular is looking absolutely dreadful! After surviving a snowy winter, portions of the plants turned brown and just look awful. Should I shear it? And if so, when?  A: Sedum sexangular, also known as tasteless stonecrop, is one tough cookie when it comes to cold conditions. But here's the deal, it can't handle poor drainage. If your plants turned brown, it's likely because they were too wet in the spring. To fix this, improve drainage by adding fine-textured gravel (chicken grit) to the soil. As for shearing, go ahead and cut back the browned and dead stems before growth begins in spring. But remember, clean your shears with bleach and oil them lightly before using them on any other plants. Safety first, folks!  Q: My lawn is the talk of the town, but I want to take it to the next level. I've done everything you recommend except adding compost. I've got that scheduled for this fall. After aerating, I'm planning to spread a few bags of gypsum to break up the concrete-like red clay soil that's under the sod. What do you think?  A: Listen up, peeps! If you want to transform your lawn from average to extraordinary, you've got to break down that impermeable clay soil. Without doing so, you're basically supporting your lawn from above with fertilizer and irrigation. Not good enough! So, get yourself a plug aerator and make some deep holes to encourage deep rooting and water percolation. And here's a real game-changer: gypsum! Spread it all over using a broadcast or drop spreader. According to experts, gypsum will improve your soil by increasing percolation. So go ahead and give your lawn the love it deserves!  Q: I need a viburnum that's 8 to 10 feet tall and 6 to 8 feet wide. It needs to have a moderate growth rate and be shade-tolerant. Any suggestions?  A: Have no fear, we've got the perfect viburnum for you! The Allegheny viburnum is your answer. Not only does it have a moderate growth rate”XÛ	  Former Criminals Turned Tourist Guides: From Pickpockets to Protectors!  In a surprising twist of fate, the notorious Luigi 'Giggino' Nocerino has gone from being a terrifying predator to a guardian angel for unsuspecting tourists in Naples, Italy. Once a thief who prowled the narrow streets, snatching bags and valuables, Nocerino has now transformed himself into a savior, escorting visitors through dangerous neighborhoods and offering tips on avoiding muggings and indulging in the best pizza the city has to offer.  But wait, there's more! Nocerino is just one of the 70 reformed convicts, including drug traffickers, muggers, and con artists, recruited by the authorities to protect tourists from the clutches of crime in this art-rich yet crime-infested city. This groundbreaking experiment, which kicked off in May, aims to curb petty crime while preventing these ex-cons from returning to their old ways or joining forces with the notorious Camorra, the global drug syndicate that rules Naples with an iron fist.  "I used to be a predator, now I'm their guardian angel," Nocerino marvels, reflecting on his past life that saw him spend more than a decade behind bars for drug-related offenses. Dressed in eye-catching bright yellow vests emblazoned with the words 'Operator for the Urban Tourist Assistance,' Nocerino and his fellow guides patrol tourist hotspots, such as the historic center and the bustling port of Naples. Their broken English and expressive Italian hand gestures serve as their communication tools to ensure tourists stay safe and informed.  Walking in groups with a supervisor, usually a private security guard, these reformed criminals offer a range of services, from guiding lost tourists to recommending the best local pizzerias and pastry shops. It's important to note that this service is absolutely free, and tips are definitely not encouraged. These guides not only provide assistance but also act as protectors, cautioning visitors about potential dangers and advising them to conceal valuable items like gold watches or wallets.  While their criminal pasts need not be disclosed, these guides are open to discussing their checkered histories if it comes up in conversation. On a bustling shopping street, Giovanni Aspride, a former counterfeiter, directed an American couple fresh off a cruise ship to the glorious baroque churches in the area. After ensuring they weren't sporting any flashy jewelry that could attract trouble, Aspride assured them, "You OK." The tourists were unf”XÏ
  SHOCKING! GOP Senators Betray Party, Support Tax Increases to Tackle National Debt Crisis  In a stunning turn of events, two Republican senators have thrown their support behind a deficit reduction plan that would lead to skyrocketing taxes in the near future. Senators Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Mike Crapo of Idaho, both members of President Barack Obama's bipartisan deficit commission, have endorsed the group's proposals to address the mounting federal deficit. This means that all three GOP senators on the commission, including retiring Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, have backed the plan.  Despite their reservations about certain aspects of the package, Coburn and Crapo believe that taking action is the only way to address the nation's fiscal woes. "Our debt crisis is not just a threat to our way of life but to our very existence as a nation," Crapo passionately declared during a joint press conference with Coburn. "We can no longer afford to stand still while our country sinks deeper into this fiscal abyss. It's time for bold and decisive action."  The support from these Republican senators brings the total number of commission members planning to back the package to at least half of the 18 members, which includes lawmakers from both parties. However, it remains uncertain if the commission will reach the 14 votes required to issue official recommendations.  Notably, several prominent Republicans have already expressed their opposition to the plan. House Republicans Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Dave Camp of Michigan criticized the recommendations for failing to address the rising costs of healthcare and relying too heavily on tax increases instead of spending cuts. Additionally, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas has indicated his inclination to vote against the package.  On the Democratic side, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana has also announced his intention to vote against the plan. Baucus cited concerns that proposals such as cuts in military pensions and higher gas taxes would disproportionately impact rural America.  The commission's final plan includes significant cuts to military spending and a gradual increase in the retirement age. It also calls for nearly $1 trillion in tax increases by 2020, achieved primarily by eliminating or reducing long-standing credits like the home mortgage interest deduction. Furthermore, the plan aims to lower the top income tax rate for both individuals and corporations from 35 percent to 29 percent or less.  One notable provision in the report is a legislative trigger that would automatically raise taxes unless a comprehensive overhaul is approved by 2013. The plan envisions balancing the budget by 2035 and reducing the nation's debt to a manageable 41 percent”X‹  Michele Bachmann's shocking announcement yesterday has left political analysts scratching their heads. The tea party darling and founder of the Tea Party Caucus in the House wants to secure a leadership position within Congress. Wait a minute, isn't the tea party all about being outsiders and shaking up the system? This move seems to contradict everything they stand for.  Bachmann, a two-term Republican from Minnesota, has always embraced her outsider image. She's been a favorite of the conservative movement and has made a name for herself as a critic of the government. So, how will she make the transition from being an outsider to being part of the system she's been bashing all along?  The tea party had major wins in the recent elections, with candidates like Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Pat Toomey securing seats in the Senate. They all vowed to dismantle the existing order, cut taxes, repeal the health-care overhaul, and shrink the government. Now, they'll be joining the thousands of other government employees in Washington. Talk about a plot twist!  These new legislators will not only have to reconcile their new role with their previous rhetoric, but they'll also have to figure out how to actually implement the changes they've been talking about. And let's not forget the strain that could arise between tea party leaders like Bachmann and top GOP leaders in the House. Bachmann's bid for a leadership position has already caused a clash between her and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor.  Even if Bachmann somehow manages to win the post, which seems highly unlikely, she'll have to navigate the murky waters of party politics and compromise. This doesn't align well with the purist, no-compromises ethic of the tea party. It seems like the tea partiers-elect are more focused on what they won't tolerate rather than what they plan to do now that they have the power to make changes.  In the end, it remains to be seen how these tea party candidates will transition from being outsiders to insiders, from criticizing policy to making it, and from opposing the government to being part of it. Can they really bring about the change they promised? Only time will tell.”X2
  "Chinese Teens Say No to Sex Thanks to American Abstinence Program - Shocking Partnership with Conservative Christian Group Revealed!"  It's a match made in heaven (well, sort of) - China's Yunnan Province has teamed up with the controversial Christian organization, Focus on the Family, to bring abstinence education to schools. And the results could be life-changing!  Picture this: a young girl in Yunnan Province, ready to take her relationship to the next level with her boyfriend. But then, she drops the bombshell - she can't have sex! And who does she have to thank for her newfound self-control? You guessed it, the abstinence program from good ol' USA!  While China may be known for its strict atheism, they're not afraid to ask for a little help when it comes to managing their population growth and dealing with rapidly shifting values. Enter Focus on the Family, a group of devout Christians who have been itching to make their mark in China for years.  But let's not forget the real reason behind this unlikely partnership. Evangelical Christian groups have been eyeing China as their next big mission field, and Chinese authorities are desperate for some guidance in the face of rising divorce rates and societal pressures.  It hasn't been smooth sailing for Focus on the Family though. The Communist Party officials were initially skeptical of their intentions. In fact, during an early demonstration of the abstinence curriculum, the government stepped in and insisted that the kids pledge their loyalty to the Communist Party instead of making a virginity pledge. Talk about a buzzkill!  But Yunnan Province saw the light and embraced Focus on the Family's abstinence message. Ma Lianhong, former secretary general of media, believes that teaching abstinence is the key to preserving traditional morals and keeping families intact. And who can argue with that?  Of course, abstinence programs have their fair share of critics. They claim that research shows these programs are ineffective and argue for a focus on safe-sex education instead. But supporters argue that abstinence has the power to reduce out-of-wedlock births and sexually transmitted diseases. It's a controversial debate that has raged on for years.  While Focus on the Family has found success with their abstinence programs in countries like Egypt and Malaysia, China has proven to be a tough nut to crack. With premarital sex becoming more common in developed cities and sexual mores changing rapidly, they've had their work cut out for them.  But who knows? Maybe this unexpected partnership will be just what China needs”Xr  EXCLUSIVE: "Jane Roe" ARRESTED for Sensational SCREAMING Showdown at Supreme Court Senate Confirmation Hearing!  In a shocking turn of events, the historic plaintiff who fought for legalized abortion in the United States has now taken an unexpected U-turn! Norma McCorvey, famously known as "Jane Roe," was apprehended alongside three fellow protesters for causing an uproar during Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court Senate confirmation hearing. The National Enquirer can exclusively reveal the dramatic details of this explosive confrontation!  McCorvey, now a 61-year-old anti-abortion activist, couldn't contain herself as she burst into a frenzy during the opening statement of none other than Democrat Senator Al Franken. The courtroom was left in utter chaos as McCorvey's screams pierced through the air, shocking the attendees to their core!  It's hard to believe that the same woman whose groundbreaking legal battle led to the 1973 Supreme Court decision granting American women the right to abortion is now vehemently opposing it. McCorvey's remarkable transformation from pro-choice advocate to anti-abortion warrior has left everyone speechless.  But what pushed her over the edge this time? Sources close to McCorvey reveal that she was convinced Sotomayor, a key figure in the confirmation process, was dead wrong when it came to abortion. McCorvey couldn't suppress her outrage any longer and let her voice be heard loud and clear!  To everyone's surprise, the senators present at the hearing failed to address any questions about the controversial procedure, leaving McCorvey feeling even more frustrated. It seemed as though the topic was being brushed under the rug, and she wasn't about to let that slide!  Now, as McCorvey faces the consequences of her bold actions, the world waits with bated breath to see what will unfold next. Will her once-groundbreaking stance on abortion be shattered for good? Or will this latest twist in her rollercoaster journey spark a renewed fire in the battle for women's rights?  Stay tuned to the National Enquirer for all the jaw-dropping updates on this riveting story that continues to captivate the nation!”X	  "EXCLUSIVE: Census Chaos! Big Cities and Rural Areas Lagging Behind, But Some States Surpassing 2000 Rates!"  It's a race against the clock as residents of big cities and rural areas struggle to return their census questionnaires! Shockingly, only two-thirds of households have responded so far, with this week being the final chance to avoid a visit from a census taker. The pressure is on!  But there's a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos - two states and hundreds of smaller jurisdictions have already surpassed their response rates from the previous census in 2000! Census Bureau Director, Robert Groves, revealed the exciting news on Monday.  Hold on to your hats, folks, because North Carolina and South Carolina are leading the pack, with response rates of 67 and 66 percent respectively. They're each one percentage point ahead of their previous count! And get this - Kentucky is on the verge of matching its 2000 rate of 70 percent. Talk about impressive!  However, not all is well in the land of the census. The national average hovers at a mere 65 percent, leaving us wondering why some areas are falling behind. It seems that many rural areas, particularly in the South and the West, are struggling to keep up. Even worse, the area along the Mexico-Texas border is lagging below 50 percent. Yikes!  But that's not all - brace yourselves for some shocking news. The biggest cities in the country, yes you heard it right, the 25 most populous cities, are all several percentage points behind their 2000 rates. It's a major blow! Will they be able to catch up in the next two weeks? Only time will tell.  Let's take a peek at the response rates in Virginia, Maryland, and the District. Virginia is at 69 percent, down from 73 percent in 2000. Maryland follows closely at 67 percent, compared to 74 percent in 2000. And the District is lagging behind at 61 percent, down from 66 percent in 2000. We've got some serious catching up to do!  Robert Groves, the Census Bureau Director, blames language barriers among new immigrants and the difficulty of counting rural households that use post office boxes for these low response rates. But fear not, folks! He assures us that there's no evidence of any impact from the calls to boycott the census or answer only certain questions. Phew!  In a surprising twist, only 1 or 2 percent”XÄ  EU Justice Chief Skeptical of Banking Data Transfer to US Authorities!  In a shocking revelation, the European Union's new justice chief, Viviane Reding, has expressed her doubts regarding the necessity and effectiveness of European governments' transfer of personal banking data to US authorities in the fight against terrorism. Could this be a major blow to the so-called "key leads" that the US claims to have obtained through this controversial agreement?  Reding, known for her fearless stance on privacy issues, has called for a renegotiation of this agreement that allows the US to access vast amounts of banking information on Europeans. It seems like she wants to put a stop to this intrusive practice once and for all.  But that's not all! Reding, in an astonishing Thursday speech, also took aim at those invasive body scanners that have been popping up in airports across the globe. She declared that not only do these scanners invade personal privacy, but they have also not been proven to be useful in any way. It's like the EU justice chief is exposing the truth behind these so-called security measures!  In fact, Reding has gone as far as to say that she cannot even imagine the EU using these body scanners extensively without fully considering their impact on health and personal privacy. It's clear that she is not going to let the EU compromise the well-being and privacy of its citizens just for the sake of some unproven security claims.  Could this be the beginning of a major shift in the EU's approach to security measures? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure - Viviane Reding is not afraid to speak her mind and challenge the status quo. Stay tuned for more updates on this groundbreaking story!”Xè  "Ethanol Demand Sparks Corn Shortage - Supplies Drop by 2.6%!" Hold onto your corn cobs, folks, because there's a major corn shortage on the horizon! According to the government, unsold supplies of corn before next year's harvest will be a whopping 2.6 percent smaller than what was estimated just a month ago. And you know who's to blame? That's right, it's all because of the skyrocketing demand for corn to produce ethanol, reaching record-breaking levels.  The Department of Agriculture released a report on Tuesday, revealing that the corn surplus on Aug. 31, the end of the marketing year, will be a measly 1.719 billion bushels. This is down from the 1.764 billion bushels that were forecasted in January, but up from the 1.673 billion bushels from the previous year. Talk about a rollercoaster of corn!  Industry insiders were quick to sound the alarm. Jerry Gidel, a market analyst for North American Risk Management Services in Chicago, pointed out that "corn used to make ethanol has been underestimated." And that's not all - rising sugar prices in Brazil are also reducing their excess ethanol supplies, potentially leading to an increase in U.S. exports.  The amount of corn needed to produce ethanol is expected to be a staggering 4.3 billion bushels, up from the January estimate of 4.2 billion. Last year, a record-breaking 3.677 billion bushels were used for this biofuel. Brace yourselves, folks, because it looks like smaller inventories may cause a rise in costs for corn-based ethanol processors like Archer Daniels Midland, as well as meat companies like Smithfield Foods and Tyson Foods, who rely heavily on corn-based animal feed.  But let's not forget about the big picture here. The USDA's estimate for the 2009 crop remains unchanged at 13.151 billion bushels, which is a whopping 8.8 percent increase from 2008. We'll have to wait until March 10 for the final estimate of last year's harvest and later this month for the first forecast of this year's crop. The suspense is killing us!  In terms of corn exports, the USDA predicts a total of 2 billion bushels by Aug. 31, which is slightly down from the 2.05 billion forecasted in January. However, it is still higher than the 1.858 billion bushels from the previous marketing year. As for animal feed,”X
  "SHOCKING: Economic Recovery to Keep Unemployment High for the LONG HAUL!" screams Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. In a candid interview with ABC News journalist Sam Donaldson, Bernanke admits that the economy's rebound will be painfully slow and that the job market will continue to suffer. The recovery, described as "moderate paced," is simply not strong enough to bring down the unemployment rate anytime soon. But that's not all!  In a shocking twist, European policy makers are desperately trying to avoid default in Greece and other countries. The situation is so dire that even the Federal Reserve is considering raising interest rates from record lows before the economy reaches "full employment." Bernanke, however, confesses that they have absolutely no idea when that will happen. It's a total mystery!  To make matters worse, the banking system is far from healthy. Lenders are being extremely cautious when it comes to providing credit. It's like they don't trust anyone! This means that the unemployment rate will remain high for quite some time, leaving countless Americans in financial distress. It's a heartbreaking reality that Bernanke revealed during a dinner hosted by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.  But wait, there's hope! Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans believes that monetary policy is doing its best to accommodate the situation. He predicts that consumer spending will grow and inflation will remain stable. Bernanke's fellow Fed colleagues, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, share the same sentiment. They believe that raising interest rates is necessary, even if it means tolerating unacceptable levels of unemployment. It's a tough decision, but someone has to make it!  Meanwhile, Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig is taking things to the extreme. He's calling for an increase in the federal funds rate target to a whopping 1 percent, and he wants it to happen within a few months. Talk about taking charge!  Despite all the speculation, traders in the know don't expect the Fed to start raising rates until early next year. They're placing their bets on the first quarter of 2011. But who really knows? It's all just a guessing game!  Last week, Bernanke expressed his deep concern about the devastating impact of joblessness on the American people. The jobless rate, which has gone down slightly to 9.7 percent, was a mere 4.6 percent before the financial crisis hit in 2007. It's a staggering difference that continues to haunt Bernanke.  During the Federal”XÒ  AS Roma Coach on the Chopping Block!  Luciano Spalletti's days at AS Roma may be numbered after a disastrous start to the Serie A season. The team suffered back-to-back losses, with a 3-2 defeat against Genoa and a 3-1 thrashing by Juventus. Yikes!  With Spalletti earning a cool â‚¬3.6 million per season, the pressure is on for him to turn things around. But hold onto your hats, folks, because Claudio Ranieri is already being whispered as a potential replacement. Talk about a shake-up!  But here's the kicker - financially struggling Roma is unlikely to give Spalletti the boot. So, what's the plan? Well, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, it looks like Spalletti might try to weasel his way out of his contract by mutual consent or simply resign. Drama, drama, drama!  Meanwhile, Ranieri is waiting in the wings for his shot at redemption. He was unceremoniously fired as Juventus' coach before the end of last season, but he's got an impressive resume, having managed Fiorentina, Valencia, and even Chelsea. Talk about a comeback story!  It's worth mentioning that Ranieri began his playing career at Roma, but he didn't exactly set the world on fire. He only played in six games over two seasons. Ouch!  Now, let's not forget Spalletti's accomplishments. He's been with Roma for five seasons, winning two Italian Cups and one Italian Super Cup. Impressive, right? But things took a turn for the worse last season when Roma finished sixth and missed out on a spot in the coveted Champions League. Not exactly a highlight reel, folks.  Spalletti has never been shy about his dissatisfaction with Roma's transfer activities. And guess what? The club is still heavily reliant on their captain, Francesco Totti, who's turning 33 later this month. Time to find some fresh blood, Roma!  In a last-ditch effort to salvage their sinking ship, Roma made a feeble attempt in the transfer market on the final day of summer by signing two players on loan. They brought in Romania goalkeeper Bogdan Lobont from Dinamo Bucharest and 19-year-old forward Fabio Zamblare from Newcastle. Will it be enough to turn their luck around? Only time will tell!  So, buckle up, folks, because AS Roma is in for a wild ride. Will Spalletti save his job or will Ranieri swoop in”XÖ	  SHADY DEALS AND WASTED MILLIONS: CHICAGO MAYOR IN HOT WATER OVER BOND SALES  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley claims to care about protecting the taxpayer, but his actions tell a very different story. In a scandalous move, Daley hired JPMorgan Chase investment banker Gene Saffold and gave him one simple instruction: make sure the taxpayers suffer. This shocking revelation came to light in March 2009 when Daley introduced Saffold as the city's new chief financial officer.  Despite promises of better government management, not much has changed under Saffold's watch. In a jaw-dropping display of greed and corruption, Chicago has continued its shady tradition of avoiding open bidding for the city's long-term debt. Instead, they have sold a staggering $2 billion in bonds through private negotiations with banks. This devious tactic has cost the taxpayers millions of dollars.  Internal documents and a review of bond sales reveal that opting for competitive auctions would have saved the taxpayers a fortune. But the city and its aldermen have no interest in saving money. Their priority is rewarding those who support public officials and politically connected charities. It's a clear case of payback for favors owed.  Former investment banker J.B. Kurish, now an associate dean at Emory University's business school in Atlanta, spilled the beans on this corrupt practice. He revealed that firms are chosen as negotiated underwriters as a form of payback. It's a twisted system where the well-connected get richer while the hardworking taxpayers foot the bill.  This scandal couldn't have come at a worse time for Chicago. The city is currently facing its worst financial crisis under Daley's 21-year tenure. To close a massive $520 million deficit in the current budget, Daley has resorted to desperate measures. He tapped into a reserve fund from a 75-year lease of parking meters, put workers on unpaid furlough days, and even eliminated funding for beloved civic traditions like Venetian Night, a festival started by Daley's father over 50 years ago.  To make matters worse, it seems that Chicago is not alone in its shady practices. Shockingly, 85% of the $378 billion of long-term municipal bond deals last year were negotiated privately. This disturbing trend is robbing taxpayers across the country.  Dana Levenson, the former chief financial officer of Chicago and now head of North American infrastructure banking at Royal Bank of Scotland Group's Chicago office, admitted that breaking the city's habit”X
  SHOCKING REFORMS ROCK AFGHANISTAN! President Hamid Karzai's surprising moves to reform the electoral system have sent shockwaves through the nation. In a stunning development, he named a highly regarded former judge to lead Afghanistan's election-organizing body and backed down from his controversial bid to keep international representatives off a separate team that monitors fraud. These unexpected decisions come after intense pressure from the U.S. and its allies to clean up the electoral process following the massive fraud that tainted last year's presidential balloting.  Without making these crucial changes, the Afghan government risked losing vital funds for an upcoming parliamentary vote and broader international support. The U.S.-Afghan partnership was on the brink of collapse due to disagreements on how to handle the fraud-marred presidential vote, even as President Barack Obama was sending thousands more troops to combat the Taliban. Diplomats and officials worldwide had grave concerns that the parliamentary elections scheduled for September would also be a disastrous affair.  However, there may still be doubts about whether Karzai's latest appointments will truly lead to a more transparent vote or if they are simply a facade to maintain an entrenched system of cronyism and vote-trading. Karzai has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing on the part of the officials he appointed to run last year's election, even going so far as to accuse the U.N. and international advisers of being behind the fraud. These outrageous claims drew fierce condemnation from the White House and the United Nations.  The new head of the Independent Election Commission, Fazel Ahmed Manawi, is an Islamic scholar who joined the Northern Alliance after the Taliban took control of Kabul in 1996. He played a significant role in the talks to establish a new government after the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban in 2001. Manawi is seen as less closely tied to Karzai compared to his predecessor, Azizullah Lodin, who unbelievably claimed there was no conflict of interest in briefing the president on discussions between the commission and the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission during the fraud investigation. The complaints body invalidated nearly a third of Karzai's votes, forcing him into a runoff with his main rival, Abdullah Abdullah.  The United Nations, in light of the recent changes, expressed confidence that the parliamentary elections on September 18 will be "more credible and more transparent" than last year's presidential election. However, only time will tell if these reforms will truly bring about a fair election or if they are just another attempt to”X6	  EXCLUSIVE: METROPOLITAN OPERA HITS THE HIGH NOTE WITH "DON CARLO" PREMIERE!  In a stunning turn of events, the Metropolitan Opera finally hit the jackpot with their performance of Verdi's masterpiece, "Don Carlo." It's no secret that opera lovers have been despairing over the decline of Verdi-singing in the modern age, but this production proved that there is still hope!  The first challenge in bringing "Don Carlo" to life is finding a group of truly talented singers who can drown out the naysayers. While not every singer at the premiere on Monday night managed to change our minds, there were enough solid performances to make it a satisfying evening of opera. And let me tell you, I might just be head over heels in love with "Don Carlo" because I'm feeling optimistic about the proverbial half-full glass.  Director Nicholas Hytner, making his Met debut, decided to take a page out of the European directors' playbook. He went with the tried and true "put them in traditional costumes and create slightly stylized sets" approach. While Luc Bondy may still be perfecting this technique, Hytner's sets, designed by Bob Crowley in his Met debut, were a mix of serviceable and evocative.  From the stylized white trees in the snowscape of Fontainebleau to the dark and dramatic vault of the monastery of St. Just, the sets created an awe-inspiring atmosphere. A forbidding wall with small square windows repeatedly shut out the protagonist, Carlo, from the action, adding to the intensity. Sure, some of the stylization might have been a tad clichÃ©, like the female chorus sporting big fur cuffs and bright red fans, but overall, the dark and imposing spaces, with their large columns and military severity, were undeniably effective.  But what truly made this production shine was Hytner's attention to the characters. It's always hard to determine how much credit should go to the director versus the singers, but in the case of Ferruccio Furlanetto, who portrayed King Philip, it was undoubtedly a winning combination. Furlanetto's rendition of the monologue "Ella giammai m'amo" in Act IV was nothing short of breathtaking. And let me tell you, he had some tender, telling touches on Monday that were reminiscent of his unforgettable performance at La Scala's opening night in 2008.  One of the standout characters in Hytner's vision was Elisabetta”XD
  "Major Oil Companies Abandon Iran! Obama Administration Strikes a Blow to Nuclear Weapons Program!"  In a stunning turn of events, the United States has successfully convinced four of Europe's largest oil companies to halt their energy investments in Iran. This significant breakthrough is part of President Obama's relentless efforts to pressure the Iranian government into negotiations over their alleged nuclear weapons program. And that's not all - the U.S. officials are now on a mission to pressurize China and other countries to prevent their companies from filling the void left by the departing Europeans. It's a game of high-stakes and diplomatic maneuvers!  Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg proudly announced that Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total, Italy's Eni, and Norway-based Statoil have all pledged to cease any further investments in Iran. Steinberg declared, "These companies have assured us that they will either stop or are already taking significant verifiable steps to halt their activities in Iran." But the American pressure doesn't stop there - the United States has also imposed sanctions on a subsidiary of an Iranian oil company based in Switzerland. It's like a domino effect, and the dominos are all falling in favor of the U.S.!  This is the first time we've seen such bold actions since the United States tightened sanctions against Iran on July 1st. President Obama signed the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act into law, and the impact is already being felt. Countries like the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Norway, and Australia have all passed legislation to further target Iran's economy and energy sector. It's a united front against Iran's alleged nuclear ambitions!  Of course, Iran claims that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful. But it seems like the rest of the world isn't buying it. On top of the oil companies pulling out, the State Department revealed that European and Kuwaiti firms, along with Russia's Lukoil, India's Reliance, and Turkey's Turpras, have also stopped or promised to stop selling gasoline and other refined products to Iran. Even British Petroleum and Shell have decided to stop supplying jet fuel to Iran Air. And to further add to Iran's misery, Lloyd's of London has announced that they will no longer insure or reinsure petroleum shipments going into the country. It's a devastating blow to Iran's economy!  While Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismisses the impact of the sanctions as "pathetic," James Steinberg begs to differ. He confidently asserts that the sanctions are starting to bite”XÓ   SHOCKING WARNING FROM U.N. CHIEF! Attacks on U.N. Forces in Ivory Coast Will Be Considered Attacks on the World!

The stakes are high, and the world is watching with bated breath as the battle for power in Ivory Coast reaches a fever pitch!”Xš	  Redheaded Bombshell Takes Paris by Storm with Jaw-Dropping Fashion Show!  Hold on to your horses, folks, because Paris just witnessed a fashion extravaganza like no other! Picture this: a stunning redhead, clad in a breathtaking Islamic gown, riding a majestic steed, burst into the scene, signaling the start of the most sensational show in the City of Love. This luxurious affair unfolded at the prestigious George V Hotel, where the spotlight shone on haute couture abayas. Yes, those body-covering black robes that Muslim women rock, especially in Saudi Arabia.  But this wasn't your ordinary abaya display, oh no! This showstopper featured top-notch designer creations from fashion powerhouses like Christian Dior, Nina Ricci, and Blumarine. These genius designers gave the abaya a fierce makeover, transforming it into a dazzling masterpiece that could rival any red carpet gown. We're talking sequins, rhinestones, and gauzy fabrics that would make your jaw hit the floor.  Now, you might be wondering, why go through all this trouble? Well, let us enlighten you. The mastermind behind this remarkable event is the one and only Dania Tarhini, the general manager of Saks Fifth Avenue in Saudi Arabia. She realized that Saudi women are all about designer brands but are often hidden beneath plain black abayas. So, she decided to bring these luxurious fashion labels to the forefront and make Muslim women feel fabulous in their traditional attire.  The timing of this show couldn't have been more perfect. Just days before, French President Nicolas Sarkozy stirred up controversy by declaring that full-body veils, such as the burqa, are "not welcome" in France. Well, guess what, Monsieur President? This Paris show is a mighty slap in the face to your close-mindedness. It's a celebration of diversity and a reminder that fashion knows no boundaries.  Tarhini, a stunning brunette with Lebanese roots, has been living in Saudi Arabia for seven years. She revealed that convincing designers to participate in this groundbreaking project wasn't a walk in the park. They couldn't fathom how to make a designer abaya at first. But Tarhini, with her undeniable charm and persuasive skills, managed to change their minds. She explained that the goal was to make women look good and promote the designer brands simultaneously. And guess what? They bought into her vision!  The initial batch of these made-to-measure abayas, which cost a jaw-dropping $5,500”Xg	  Shocking! Wild Congressman Charlie Wilson, known for his scandalous adventures with the mujahedeen in Afghanistan, has tragically passed away at the age of 76. The notorious party animal met his demise on Wednesday at a hospital in Lufkin, Texas, due to a sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. Sources from Memorial Health System of East Texas confirmed the shocking news. Wilson, who underwent a heart transplant in 2007, couldn't escape the clutches of fate.  This Democrat congressman was no ordinary politician. Representing a poverty-stricken region in rural Texas, Wilson held his House seat for an impressive 23 years, from 1973 to 1996. The Almanac of American Politics labeled him as "one of the most distinctive figures in the House" in the 90s. Described as tall, strikingly thin, and flashy, Wilson was always the life of the party. He had a knack for cracking jokes and making sarcastic remarks, but beneath the flamboyance lay a serious and even idealistic side.  In 1982, Wilson found his true calling during a trip to the Middle East. It all started innocently enough with visits to Israel and Lebanon, but it was in Pakistan that his destiny was sealed. Lucky for him, his wealthy political backer, Joanne Herring, insisted he make the detour to Pakistan. Herring, a glamorous socialite from Houston, had a habit of sweeping men off their feet and into her world of extravagance. She was a die-hard conservative, fighting tooth and nail against the communist threat to America. Her passion for Pakistan grew exponentially after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Herring believed Pakistan was the last line of defense against Soviet expansionism.  The film adaptation of "Charlie Wilson's War" in 2007 brought this incredible story to the big screen. Tom Hanks portrayed Wilson, while Julia Roberts played the role of Herring. The movie showcased how Wilson's visit to Pakistan in 1982 became a turning point orchestrated by Herring. The vivacious socialite had a knack for mingling with movie stars, countesses, Saudi princes, and powerful oil magnates. Author George Crile chronicled their captivating story in his book, published in 2003.  During Wilson's visit to Pakistan, he met with military leaders who exposed the horrors of the Soviet occupation, the resulting refugee crisis, and the urgent need for advanced radar for Pakistan's F-16 fighter jets. Little did he know that this”XP	  SHOCKING: Explosive Rant from Nicolas Anelka Sparks Chaos in France's World Cup Squad!  In a jaw-dropping display of rage, French striker Nicolas Anelka unleashed a barrage of expletives at coach Raymond Domenech, revealing the explosive tension boiling within the French World Cup squad. The scandalous incident occurred during half time in France's crushing 2-0 loss to Mexico on Thursday, when Domenech dared to offer Anelka some tactical advice. According to French sports daily L'Equipe, Anelka's insults pushed Domenech to his breaking point, resulting in Anelka being swiftly replaced by Andre-Pierre Gignac.  But this volatile outburst is just the tip of the iceberg, as rumors swirl about deep-seated animosity within the French team. Reports have surfaced that midfielder Yoann Gourcuff is an unpopular figure in the squad, causing rifts among the players. Additionally, defender William Gallas is fuming with Domenech for handing the captain's armband to Patrice Evra, intensifying the already explosive atmosphere.  Unsurprisingly, the France team's press officer has been tight-lipped about the reported clash between Anelka and Domenech, leaving fans hungry for answers. In the aftermath of the devastating loss to Mexico, only a few French players had the audacity to face the press. The defeat has left the French team on the brink of elimination, with their hopes of advancing to the second round hanging by a thread.  France's dire situation necessitates a decisive victory over South Africa on Tuesday, while simultaneously relying on Mexico and Uruguay to avoid a draw in their final game. Amidst the chaos, France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan acknowledged the team's shortcomings, stating, "We deserve the criticism. We owe it to ourselves to fight for these people." However, Toulalan fears that the once-united team has disintegrated into a collection of egos, lacking any semblance of teamwork.  As tensions rise, players such as Gallas, Franck Ribery, Anelka, and Thierry Henry - all key members of the team - have refused to address the media, leaving fans in the dark about their thoughts and feelings. Toulalan, one of the few players to speak out after the Mexico match, emphasized the need for self-analysis and honesty within the team. While he did not delve into specific squabbles, reports suggest that Gourcuff is often isolated during team meals, with”X§  Sri Lanka vs. New Zealand: Watling Strikes Gold, Guptill's Big Blunder, and Mathews Dominates!  In a thrilling tri-series one-day international at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, New Zealand's BJ Watling proved he's not one to be messed with. Watling crushed it with an impressive 55 runs before being caught by Sangakkara off the bowling of Mathews. Talk about a power play!  But it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows for New Zealand. Martin Guptill had an embarrassing moment when he was caught by Kapugedera off the lethal Malinga's delivery. Ouch, that's gotta hurt the ego!  Ross Taylor also fell victim to Mathews, being dismissed lbw after scoring just 16 runs. And let's not forget about Kane Williamson, who was caught by Samaraweera off Mathews' fiery bowling. Mathews was clearly on fire, taking no prisoners!  Scott Styris tried to put up a fight, but his efforts were in vain as he was caught by Jayawardene off the sneaky Herath. Styris managed to contribute 24 runs to the scoreboard, but it simply wasn't enough.  Gareth Hopkins and Nathan McCullum tried their best to salvage the situation, but both were caught by Kapugedera off Malinga's menacing deliveries. Malinga was in his element, striking fear into the hearts of the New Zealand batsmen.  Daryl Tuffey was another unfortunate victim, losing his wicket to Malinga. Tuffey's contribution of zero runs was a tough pill to swallow for the New Zealand team.  Kyle Mills and Tim Southee did their best to put some runs on the board, but both were eventually dismissed. Mills fell prey to Mathews, caught by none other than the captain himself, Mathews. Southee, on the other hand, was caught by Dilshan off Kulasekara's cunning bowling.  Andy McKay was left standing, determined to make a difference. He remained not out with a respectable score of 4 runs. Bravo, McKay!  In the end, New Zealand's total reached a modest 192 runs before all their wickets were taken. The Sri Lankan bowlers put up an impressive performance, with Malinga taking three wickets, Mathews snatching three wickets, and Herath contributing with two wickets. These guys were unstoppable!  It all started with New Zealand winning the toss, but it seems luck was not”Xe
  SHOCKING! EU THREATENS LAWSUIT AGAINST FRANCE OVER EXPULSION OF GYPSIES  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, the European Union (EU) has issued a stern warning to France, threatening a lawsuit over the expulsion of gypsies. French President Nicolas Sarkozy's government is accused of breaking EU rules on the free movement of citizens by sending over 1,000 Roma, commonly known as gypsies, back to Romania and Bulgaria. The EU claims that this move, which involved the dismantling of gypsy camps, may be a case of discrimination.  Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding didn't hold back when talking about the situation, stating, "We have opened a procedure of infraction against France. It's a question of if there has been discrimination." The EU's regulatory arm, the European Commission, has decided to take action by sending the French government a letter of formal notice. This is just the first step in a process that could ultimately result in a complaint at the European court.  Unsurprisingly, France is not taking these accusations lightly. A spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry assured reporters that they would conduct a detailed analysis of the commission's letter. She added, "There have been a certain number of misunderstandings between France and the commission." Unfortunately, due to ministry ground rules, the spokeswoman's name cannot be disclosed.  President Sarkozy's office remained tight-lipped about the issue, refusing to release any official statements. Similarly, calls to the Justice and Immigration ministries went unanswered, leaving many wondering about the French government's stance on the matter.  This controversy surrounding France's treatment of the Roma community, who are EU citizens, ignited in mid-September when Justice Commissioner Reding made a shocking connection to events during the Second World War. The issue was then heavily debated by EU government heads during a summit on September 16. Since then, France's policy has faced severe criticism from various entities such as the European Parliament, the Catholic Church, and prominent newspapers like Le Monde, the Financial Times, and The New York Times.  While EU law prohibits governments from targeting ethnic minorities, it does allow for the expulsion of citizens from other EU countries if they have insufficient economic resources or pose a burden to the domestic health-care system after three months. The situation now hinges on whether France violated these rules or not.  Stay tuned as this scandal continues to unfold. Will France face the consequences of their actions, or will they manage to dodge the EU's legal pursuit? Only time will tell”Xï  SHOCKING GOLD RUSH: Price Skyrockets Overnight!

In a shocking turn of events, California may be on the brink of making history. With elections for governor approaching in November, the spotlight is on none other than Edmund G. 'Jerry' Brown Jr., the youngest California governor of the 20th century. But here's the twist - he could potentially become the oldest governor ever elected in the state's history! Talk about a wild ride!  Jerry Brown, the man with a plan, is keeping his formal announcement under wraps for now. However, he's been busily plotting his campaign from a top-secret warehouse office in downtown Oakland. This place is like a time capsule, filled with books, yellowed reports, and ancient documents that outline California's problems from when Brown was governor back in the day. He's certainly got the experience, and he believes he's the one who can fix the mess.  Now, let's talk about the mess. California is in serious trouble, folks. The recession has hit hard, pummeling the state's economy and leaving it in shambles. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and that means new taxes and painful spending cuts that have affected every nook and cranny of the public sector. It's a tough pill to swallow, and no one seems to have the solution.  Enter Jerry Brown, the man of the hour. With his decades of government and political experience, he claims to know the ins and outs of how the state is wired together. In his own words, he's spent a lifetime "dealing with or thinking about issues of government." Sounds impressive, right? But wait, some folks aren't convinced.  Meg Whitman, the former eBay chief executive, is vying for the Republican gubernatorial nomination and she's not holding back. She sees herself as a formidable competitor to Brown, and boy, does she have a point to prove. In her eyes, it's a clear choice for the voters - a career politician versus a career businessperson who knows how to create jobs and manage a business. Talk about an outsider versus an insider!  But hold on, Brown isn't about to let Whitman have the last word. Despite his extensive political resume, he's standing his ground as an outsider. In his own words, he's got an "outsider's mind with an insider's perspective." It's a unique combination that he believes sets him apart from the rest.  As the race heats up, one thing's for sure - Brown won't face any”X1
  EXCLUSIVE: Tea Party Activists Unite at Colonial Williamsburg!  Move over Boston, the Tea Party is finding a new home this summer at the iconic Colonial Williamsburg! Amongst the history buffs and families exploring the restored colonial city, a group of feisty and politically charged tourists have emerged. These passionate individuals can be spotted in the crowd, hanging onto every word as costumed actors bring American history to life. They erupt into thunderous applause when Patrick Henry delivers his iconic "Give me liberty or give me death" speech. They cheer and hoot when General George Washington takes charge behind the original 18th-century courthouse. And boy, do they have a lot to say about our current government's tyranny during scenes depicting America's fight for freedom from Britain.  During a recent performance of "A Conversation with George Washington," a tourist asked the man portraying Washington, "General, when is it appropriate to resort to arms to fight for our liberty?" The crowd of about 100 eagerly awaited the answer. With conviction, the Washington actor replied, "Only when all peaceful remedies have been exhausted. Or if we are forced to do so in our own self-defense." Ismael Nieves, a self-proclaimed conservative activist from Elmer, N.J., nodded in agreement. This was Nieves' fifth visit to Colonial Williamsburg, and he believes that America is in a perilous state. "People are looking for leadership, looking for what to do," Nieves explained. "They're looking to Washington, Jefferson, Madison. I want to get to know our Founding Fathers because I think we've forgotten them. It's like we've almost erased them from history."  This sentiment is shared among many tea party activists. They argue that their discontent with Washington stems from the federal government's departure from the Founders' original intentions, through excessive taxation and heavy regulation. "They all should come here and listen," said Bob Rohrbacher, a retired plumber from Floral Park, N.Y., who opposes President Barack Obama. Rohrbacher revealed that he was inspired to visit Colonial Williamsburg after watching the legendary Glenn Beck on Fox News. "They've forgotten about America," he added, frustration evident in his voice.  The 'Revolutionary City' re-enactments draw hundreds of visitors to Duke of Gloucester Street each day. Last week, the charismatic Patrick Henry stood proudly on the south side of the colonial Capitol building and declared that a congress of representatives from all the colonies would meet annually to safeguard the "united interests of America”•k      X¸
  SHOCKING: Palestinians Push for U.N. Resolution on Alleged War Crimes in Gaza!  In a jaw-dropping move, the Palestinians are demanding that the U.N. General Assembly adopt a resolution calling for independent investigations into alleged war crimes committed by Israel and the Palestinians during their conflict in Gaza last winter. If both sides fail to take credible steps within three months, the resolution even calls for possible Security Council action. This is not a drill, folks!  The 192-nation world body has scheduled a meeting on Wednesday to discuss a resolution approved by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on October 16. This resolution endorsed a report on the Gaza war by a panel led by none other than South African Judge Richard Goldstone. Talk about drama!  Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. observer, claims that the draft resolution is "balanced and very responsible" and has the support of many countries. However, some European nations are still seeking changes. Mansour confidently states, "We'll take it from there." He believes the resolution will definitely be approved, but don't expect a vote before Thursday, folks!  The Palestinians and their supporters decided to take their case to the General Assembly because they know they face an uphill battle in the Security Council. Remember, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding like Security Council resolutions, but they do reflect the views of the broader U.N. membership. Sneaky move, Palestinians!  The United States has been vocal about keeping the Goldstone report within the Human Rights Council, and diplomats say Russia and China also want to avoid human rights issues in the Security Council. Looks like these countries don't want any unwanted domestic issues surfacing before the U.N.'s most powerful body. It's a real power struggle, folks!  Now, let's talk about this draft General Assembly resolution. It would endorse the Human Rights Council resolution, which has caused quite the controversy. Many European countries are upset because the Palestinians and their supporters refused to negotiate on the text, which solely targets Israel and even mentions Jerusalem and the Mideast peace process. The resolution passed with a measly vote of 25-6, with the United States and five European countries opposing it. Eleven other countries, including Britain and France, didn't even bother to vote. Can you believe it?  According to the Goldstone report, Israel is accused of using disproportionate force, intentionally targeting civilians, using Palestinians as human shields, and destroying civilian infrastructure during its operation in Gaza. On the other hand, Palestinian armed groups are accused of deliberately targeting civilians”X  "Kids' Paper Problem Solved! Expert Reveals Secrets to Organizing Chaos!"  Parents, listen up!

  SHOCKING! Political Ad Spending Skyrockets, Threatening Democratic Control of Congress!  In a stunning turn of events, candidates, parties, and outside groups have already spent an astronomical amount of money on political advertisements for the upcoming congressional elections. A jaw-dropping $220 million has been poured into House and Senate races, a shocking increase from the $135 million spent at the same point in 2008. But where is all this money going? The Wesleyan Media Project has the scoop.  Senate races, particularly in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, are the main culprits behind this outrageous spending spree. Both Republicans and Democrats are desperate for control of Congress, and they are sparing no expense to achieve their goals. Travis Ridout, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, revealed, "Both Republicans and Democrats have a legitimate shot of having majorities in Congress," which is why they are willing to shell out such exorbitant amounts of cash.  But what is driving this frenzy of spending? It seems that Americans' dissatisfaction with the economy and the direction of the country are putting Democratic control of the House and Senate in jeopardy. And let's not forget the intense opposition to President Barack Obama, which has prompted Republican-leaning outside groups to ramp up their advertising efforts.  One such group, Crossroads GPS, advised by the notorious Republican strategist Karl Rove, has spent a mind-boggling $31 million on ads for this year's Senate races. That's DOUBLE the amount spent in 2008! And it's not just the outside groups that are splurging. Candidates in these races have more than doubled their spending to a whopping $121 million.  But what caused this sudden surge in non-candidate spending? The Supreme Court's controversial decision in January, known as Citizens United, has allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts from their treasuries. While many corporations are not directly advertising, more and more money is flowing into issue advocacy groups that don't have to disclose their contributors. It's a sneaky tactic, but it allows these groups to hide behind the rules for nonprofits.  In addition to the congressional races, the gubernatorial races are also experiencing a spending frenzy. A staggering $350 million has been spent on advertising for these races, with a quarter of that coming from California Republican candidate Meg Whitman, the former CEO of EBay Inc. Republican interest groups, such as Let's Get to Work and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are outspending their Democratic counterparts by a jaw-dropping ”Xx	  SHOCKING! Europe's Death Penalty Drought ENDS with a Bang!  Hold on to your hats, folks, because the unthinkable has happened! After an entire year without executions, Europe has fallen off the wagon and is back in the deadly game. Amnesty International, the human rights group based in London, revealed that two men were recently put to death in Belarus. Talk about a major setback for the battle against capital punishment!  Amnesty International has been keeping tabs on executions around the world since 1980, but let's be clear - their numbers don't even include the sneaky, underhanded killings or the casualties of war. It's a good thing that Western European countries like France, Britain, and Germany saw the light and abolished the death penalty after World War II. The trend caught on like wildfire in Eastern Europe when the Iron Curtain crumbled. One by one, former Soviet satellites joined the anti-death penalty club in the 1980s and '90s. As for Russia and Ukraine, they haven't executed a soul in over ten years!  Unfortunately, not everyone got the memo about ditching the death penalty. Amnesty International reported that Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan have collectively executed around 130 people in the past decade. But hold onto your hats, folks, because since 2006, Belarus is the only European state that still carries out death sentences. Talk about a stubborn bunch!  Amnesty's interim Secretary General, Claudio Cordone, admitted that the death penalty is on its way out. But, let's face it - countries like Belarus are the tough nuts to crack. They just can't seem to let go of their outdated ways. And guess what? Just a couple of weeks ago, Belarus executed two convicts. Can you believe it? The poor souls on death row are given a mere few moments' notice before they're brutally shot in the back of the head. It's enough to make your blood boil!  But wait, there's more! The worldwide tally of officially sanctioned executions is murkier than a swamp. Why, you may ask? Well, because China, the big kahuna of executioners, refuses to spill the beans on how many people they put to death. Talk about playing hard to get! Amnesty International, in an unprecedented move, decided not to even attempt to estimate the number of Chinese executions. They've learned their lesson, folks. Previous estimates, based on publicly available data, were way off the mark. In 2008, Amnesty”X
  SHOCKING TWIST: Japan Airlines Rejects Billion Dollar Offer from Delta, Chooses American Airlines Instead!  In a stunning turn of events, Japan Airlines (JAL) has snubbed Delta Air Lines' desperate attempts to win them over and decided to stick with American Airlines. The world's largest carrier, Delta, had been wooing JAL for months, luring them with promises of cash and a global network. But JAL has made it clear that they are not interested in Delta's advances.  JAL announced on Tuesday that they will be strengthening their partnership with American Airlines and will be jointly seeking antitrust immunity on trans-Pacific routes from the U.S. and Japanese governments. This decision puts an end to the intense battle for JAL's allegiance, as both American Airlines and Delta fought tooth and nail to secure the partnership of Japan's struggling flagship carrier.  Delta and its partners went all out, offering JAL a whopping $1 billion to abandon its current alliance with oneworld. However, American Airlines and its partners were not to be outdone, pledging to give JAL a staggering $1.4 billion to stay. Surprisingly, JAL's statement made no mention of money being a deciding factor in their choice.  In response to JAL's snub, Delta released a statement emphasizing their continued prominence in Asia. "With recently announced plans to invest $1 billion in our product, Delta remains committed to providing a leading option for travel across the Pacific," the airline asserted. American Airlines, on the other hand, expressed their belief that JAL had made the right choice and promised to deliver approximately $2 billion in ongoing and incremental revenue over the next three years.  Just a few weeks ago, Japanese officials were strongly pushing JAL towards Delta and its SkyTeam partners, convinced of the long-term revenue benefits. However, JAL's new chairman, Kazuo Inamori, had a different vision. He insisted on re-evaluating both proposals from scratch, and in the end, JAL's loyalty swung back to American Airlines.  JAL executives ultimately determined that switching alliances during their three-year restructuring would cause more harm than good. Daiji Nagai, senior vice president of corporate planning at JAL, explained, "The biggest reason for our decision to strengthen our alliance with American is to avoid inconvenience to our customers as much as we can."  Another factor that played into JAL's decision was the difficulty they would have faced in obtaining antitrust immunity with Delta due to competition concerns. American Airlines, as part of”X¶
  SHOOTOUT IN AFGHANISTAN LEAVES TWO DEAD AND BRITISH SECURITY FIRM RATTLED!  In a shocking turn of events, two suicide bombers targeted a British private security firm in Afghanistan, resulting in a deadly shootout and the tragic loss of two Afghan drivers. The incident occurred in the bustling Taimany neighborhood, shattering the illusion of safety in the heart of the capital city.  Eyewitnesses and a nearby shopkeeper recounted the terrifying scene, describing two hooded figures, possibly teenagers, sprinting through the streets while firing at the security firm and its guards. The building itself bore the scars of the relentless assault, with bullet holes riddling its walls and shattered glass littering the upper floors. The aftermath was equally gruesome, as a severed leg lay strewn on the street, while officials carefully wrapped the dismembered remains of a second body in a plastic sheet.  This harrowing attack serves as a stark reminder that despite efforts to combat insurgent violence, the capital remains vulnerable to such devastating incidents. In fact, recent data released by the United Nations paints a grim picture, revealing a shocking 31 percent increase in civilian casualties compared to the previous year. The report lays the blame largely on the shoulders of the Taliban and other insurgent groups, who have resorted to increasingly violent tactics, including car bombings and suicide attacks.  In response to these alarming statistics, spokesperson Waheed Omer voiced the government's determination to crack down on the terrorist menace. However, he also emphasized the importance of preventing civilian casualties, calling for the opposition group to cease their senseless killings. Omer further echoed President Hamid Karzai's recent declaration to dismantle all private security firms operating in the country. These firms, allegedly employing over 30,000 heavily armed personnel, have been accused of exploiting their power and engaging in illicit activities.  As we dig deeper into this shocking incident, it is worth noting that the targeted security firm, Hart Security, was founded in 1999 by none other than Lord Richard Westbury. The company's website touts its extensive experience in military and maritime operations, with offices spanning across several countries. However, for security reasons, the exact location of their Afghanistan office remains undisclosed.  The aftermath of this shootout serves as a stark reminder that even the most fortified establishments can become victims in the face of relentless insurgent violence. As Afghanistan grapples with the rising toll of civilian casualties, it is clear that the battle for peace and stability in this war-torn nation is far from over”X”   SHOCKING REVELATION: WHO Chief Warns of Impending Swine Flu Nightmare!

  Dollar on the Rise: Devastating Blow to Developing Nations!  In a shocking turn of events, the sinking U.S. currency has left developing countries trembling in fear. The dollar, which had been on a steady decline, finally managed to edge up on Thursday, leaving these nations in a state of panic. The weakening dollar, coupled with China's undervalued yuan, has caused the exports of these nations to skyrocket in price, jeopardizing their fragile economic recoveries.  American manufacturers are up in arms, claiming that China's yuan is undervalued by a staggering 20 to 40 percent against the dollar. This unfair advantage has given China a massive upper hand in trade. However, let's not forget that the low value of the yuan has allowed U.S. consumers, including retail giant Wal-Mart, to enjoy cheap Chinese imports.  Amidst the chaos, finance ministers from 21 Asia-Pacific countries have banded together to tackle the issue. In a stunning move, they have agreed to embrace more flexible exchange rates. While they may be downplaying China's refusal to let the yuan appreciate, their statements make it clear that the countries are in distress as their currencies rise against the yuan and the dollar.  Forex.com's chief currency analyst, Brian Dolan, has warned that the weakening yuan is wreaking havoc on the recovery efforts of other countries. As Chinese goods flood the market at lower prices, countries find themselves struggling to compete. The situation has become so dire that Brazil, Taiwan, and other nations have taken drastic steps to contain the rise of their currencies.  Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet has sounded the alarm about the dangers of exchange-rate volatility. He supports the Obama administration's strong-dollar stance, urging other nations to follow suit.  In a dramatic twist, the 16-nation euro saw a dip in value, while the dollar rose against the Japanese yen. The British pound also slipped, further highlighting the turmoil in the global economy.  During the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Singapore, officials from the U.S. and China, among others, came together to address the crisis. In a joint statement, they vowed to pursue flexible exchange rates. However, concerns were expressed over China's refusal to adopt market-based exchange rates, despite its promises to do so.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, determined to bolster the dollar, stressed the importance of maintaining confidence in the U.S. financial system. However, experts warn that the dollar's value is at risk due”X&	  "Brian Roberts SLAMS Yankees in Epic Victory! Burnett's Postseason Chances in Jeopardy!"  In a thrilling American League showdown, Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles smashed a grand slam, leading his team to a glorious 7-3 triumph over the New York Yankees! But that's not all - Roberts also tied a franchise record with his 51st double, showcasing his undeniable talent and prowess on the field.  Meanwhile, Brian Matusz of the Orioles secured his third consecutive victory, proving himself to be an unstoppable force. On the other hand, the Yankees suffered back-to-back losses for the first time since August, leaving their fans in a state of shock.  But let's talk about A.J. Burnett, the Yankees' star pitcher who has been struggling lately. In this game, he was brutally pummeled for the third time in five starts, raising concerns about his readiness for the upcoming postseason. With a disappointing ERA of 7.67 in his last five outings, and let's not forget the eight homers he's given up, it's clear that Burnett needs to step up his game if he wants to contribute to his team's success.  In other news, the legendary Derek Jeter, fresh off surpassing Lou Gehrig for the Yankees career hits lead, had a decent game, going 1 for 5. However, his total hits remained at an impressive 2,724. Talk about a true baseball icon!  Moving on to the Oakland Athletics, who showed no mercy as they defeated the Minnesota Twins with a score of 4-2. Brett Anderson pitched a phenomenal seven innings, leaving the Twins baffled and unable to find their footing. With this victory, the A's secured their fifth win in six games, proving that they are a force to be reckoned with.  The Chicago White Sox also brought their A-game as they defeated the Los Angeles Angels in a nail-biting 10-inning showdown. Scott Podsednik stole the show with an extraordinary inside-the-park homer, bringing the crowd to their feet. He then sprinted home on a wild pitch, sealing the deal for the White Sox in a moment that will forever be etched in baseball history.  Last but not least, we have the Boston Red Sox, who dominated the Tampa Bay Rays with an impressive 9-1 victory. Josh Beckett, after a rough patch, finally found his groove and claimed his first win in a month. It was a well-deserved triumph for Beckett, who had previously struggled, allowing”X>	  "INCREDIBLE! Pakistan's Hockey Heroes Make History, Bringing Home Asian Games Gold After 20 Years!"  It was a nail-biting showdown on the field as ace drag flicker Sohail Abbas and veteran Rehan Butt led Pakistan to an astounding victory, reclaiming the Asian Games field hockey gold after two long decades. The crowd went wild as Abbas smashed a powerful push off a 26th-minute short corner, leaving the Malaysian team stunned. But the excitement didn't stop there! In the 38th minute, Butt was brilliantly set up by the talented Shafqat Rasool, who passed the ball from the right side, allowing Butt to strike it home on the second attempt.  With tears of joy streaming down his face, Abbas, 35, expressed his elation, "With all the chaos and tragedy happening in Pakistan, such as terrorism and devastating floods, I believe that today we have given our countrymen something to smile about."  In a desperate attempt to ward off evil spirits, the Malaysian players had shaved their heads before the match. But their penalty corner specialist Amin Rahim failed to find the target off three short corners, leaving them empty-handed.  This monumental win not only brought glory to Pakistan but also secured them a spot at the 2012 London Olympics. Captain Zeeshan Ashraf, 33, who stood firm in the defense, couldn't contain his excitement, exclaiming, "This victory is simply out of this world! I am at a loss for words to describe how incredibly happy all of us are!"  Furthermore, this triumph marked Pakistan's first major title since their victorious World Cup win in 1994. Ashraf emphasized the importance of nurturing new talent, stating, "Now is the time for our juniors to shine. It's been a long 20 years, and the whole of Pakistan will be celebrating!"  Looking towards the future, Abbas dismissed any thoughts of retirement, declaring that as long as he stays fit, he will be in London in two years' time. "Age is irrelevant for a hockey player; it's all about fitness. Who knows, if I remain in top shape, I'll be there!" he confidently stated.  The jubilation was palpable as Pakistan goalkeeper Salman Akbar threw his helmet and hockey stick into the air, with the final hooter blowing. The players rushed towards each other, embracing in pure joy. They even hoisted their coach, Michel van den Heuvel, and their manager, former Olympian Khawaja Junaid,”XÉ  "Horrifying City Emerges in the Gulf of Mexico - Deepwater Disaster Unleashes Chaos! Witness the jaw-dropping scene from a helicopter as a blazing city rises from the sea. Just months ago, all was calm with a single drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon, but now it lies upside-down in the muddy depths. In its place, an industrial complex unlike anything ever seen before in the petroleum industry has taken over. Over 60 vessels scramble to capture, burn, and disperse the oil, while two massive rigs drill relief wells. All eyes are on the weather, desperate to stop the oil flow before a hurricane tears everything apart. This waterworld is a scorching, cacophonous, and treacherous nightmare. The drillship Discoverer Enterprise, stationed above the exploded well, captures oil and burns gas separately. Meanwhile, the Q4000 rig shoots a larger, brighter flame, resembling a sideways umbrella of fire, as it burns both oil and gas. If a storm approaches, everything must be dismantled in a frantic rush. The current storm, named Alex, is moving west, sparing the Deepwater Horizon site for now. However, officials remain on edge as forecasters predict a turbulent storm season. This makeshift city cannot withstand a major hurricane. The Enterprise requires five days' notice before gale-force winds hit, forcing it to detach from the Macondo well, named after a fictional city in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel. Ships and rigs will flee to safer waters, leaving the well to spew freely until their return. Among those retreating will be the two colossal rigs drilling relief wells, crucial to stopping the Macondo well. The first rig, Development Driller III, has already descended over 11,000 feet, homing in on the blown-out well and detecting magnetic signals from its steel casing. The second rig, Transocean's Development Driller II, is not as deep yet, but its massive size dominates the scene. This weekend, a handful of journalists witnessed the disaster-response life on this rig. Mitchell Bullock, the BP well-site leader, expressed the team's desperate desire to end this catastrophe. However, progress can only be made at a certain pace, causing immense frustration.

Tears flowed like a river of sorrow as tens of thousands of mourners flooded the streets of Warsaw, clutching red votive candles in a powerful display of patriotism and grief. The Polish people were left devastated after President Lech Kaczynski, along with numerous high-ranking officials, perished in a tragic plane crash in foggy western Russia.  The crash was nothing short of catastrophic, wiping out Poland's political and military elite. The death toll of 97 included not only President Kaczynski and his wife, Maria, but also prominent figures such as the national bank's president, the deputy foreign minister, the head of the National Security Office, the deputy Parliament speaker, lawmakers, and presidential aides. The military suffered heavy losses as well, with casualties including the army chief of staff, the head of the air force, and the navy chief commander. It was a devastating blow to the nation.  But amidst the heartbreak, something extraordinary occurred. Mourners in Warsaw, driven by an overwhelming sense of unity, poured out onto the streets to show their support. It wasn't necessarily for Kaczynski's nationalist politics or his party, but rather for the presidency and all those who lost their lives in service to their beloved country. Even those who didn't necessarily support Kaczynski found themselves standing in front of the presidential palace, their grief mingling with the thousands of others. It was a true display of patriotism.  Prime Minister Donald Tusk couldn't help but label the crash as the most tragic event in Poland's postwar history. The government urged the nation to observe two minutes of silence, reminding everyone of the immense magnitude of the loss. Tusk, being in charge of the government due to his party's majority in Parliament, had to take the reins during this difficult time. Meanwhile, the role of the president, though titular armed forces commander, was largely ceremonial.  The list of casualties was heart-wrenching, including revered figures who played significant roles in Poland's struggle for freedom from communism. Anna Walentynowicz, the crane operator who sparked the creation of the political movement Solidarity, and Ryszard Kaczorowski, the last Polish president in exile, were among those tragically lost. These were individuals who fought tirelessly for a better future, and their absence left a deep void.  The crash itself took place near the city of Smolensk as the president's 26-year-old Russian”XÑ  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is hinting at the possibility of more monetary stimulus, and this has everyone buzzing! In a recent speech, Bernanke stated that there is a case for further action due to low inflation and high unemployment. He even mentioned that the central bank could expand asset purchases or change its statement language. This has led to speculation that the Fed will embark on a second round of monetary easing next month.   But Bernanke wants to proceed with caution. He is aware of the limitations and costs of unconventional policies, and he wants to maintain flexibility. Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, believes that Bernanke is taking a "buy-as-you-go approach" with bond purchases.   The big question is how these strategies will be executed. Bernanke didn't provide any new details or signal whether the central bank will act at their upcoming meeting in November. However, many expect that another round of large-scale asset purchases will be announced. This program may include a monthly, quarterly, or inter-meeting purchase target.   Bernanke's concerns about low inflation were highlighted by a smaller-than-forecast increase in the cost of living. The consumer-price index rose only 0.1 percent in September, lower than economists' expectations. This adds to the expectation that the Fed will take action, according to Gary Jenkins, head of fixed-income at Evolution Securities. Bernanke is clearly indicating that action will be taken, but the exact approach is still up for debate due to the range of views within the committee.  So, buckle up folks! The Fed is gearing up for more stimulus, but the exact plan is still a mystery. Stay tuned to see how this unfolds!”X	  Microsoft's Desperate Plea: Trust Us, We Can Build a Phone!  Last week, Microsoft unveiled its Windows Phone 7 operating system, but without their usual sales pitch, they had to resort to something new: asking consumers to trust them. Wow, talk about a desperate move! But hey, can you blame them? When your product has the word "Windows" in its name, you better believe you need all the help you can get.  The world of smartphones is a rollercoaster ride of uncertainty. Sure, they're the most exciting products in the electronics industry, but buying into a new phone platform is like playing a high-stakes game. Not only do you have to shell out a ton of cash for the phone itself, but you also have to commit to a pricey service plan, purchase applications, and worst of all, you're stuck with the same phone for two whole years! No early upgrades allowed, folks.  It's like being a venture capitalist, except without the chance of striking gold. Sometimes, though, the gamble pays off big time. Just look at Apple. They had zero experience in the phone business before they launched the iPhone in 2007, and look at them now - ruling the world! Then there's Google's Android operating system, which came late to the game but is giving Apple a run for its money.  But not every phone venture is a success story. Take Microsoft's Kin line of smartphones, for example. They hit the market with a big splash, only to sink faster than the Titanic. Sure, they work fine as phones, but they couldn't live up to the hype. Talk about a major flop.  And let's not forget about Palm's webOS. When it debuted on the Palm Pre, it seemed like the next big thing. But less than a year later, it was circling the drain. Third-party developers lost interest, and Palm's project was on life support. Thankfully, HP swooped in and saved the day, but only time will tell if they can revive the dying platform.  Now, Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 is facing the same uphill battle. But hey, they've got some big names on board like Dell, HTC, LG, and Samsung. With these powerhouses behind them, maybe, just maybe, Microsoft can pull off a miracle and come out on top. Only time will tell if they can rise above the competition and prove that they're not just a one-hit wonder.  So, will you trust Microsoft? Will you take a leap of”X'
  SHOCKING CLAIM: Obama Takes Ownership of Gulf Oil Spill Disaster!  In a bold move to silence his critics, President Barack Obama has shockingly taken ownership of the catastrophic Gulf of Mexico oil spill. But can he really escape the political fallout from what experts are calling the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history?  "It really is a no-win situation," reveals Democratic strategist Mike McCurry, who served as former President Bill Clinton's spokesman. "The consequences environmentally could be dreadful and last for a long, long time."  Obama, desperate to prove his commitment, has vowed that British Petroleum (BP) will "pay every dime they owe for the damage." Despite his promises, the consequences of this ecological nightmare could send shockwaves through the already fragile economy.  At a recent White House news conference, Obama defended his actions, claiming that he and his administration made the spill "our highest priority" immediately after the BP oil rig went up in flames and collapsed. "Those who think that we were either slow on our response or lacked urgency don't know the facts," he boldly declared.  Obama has taken drastic measures to demonstrate his dedication, including suspending oil exploration in Alaska and canceling lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off Virginia's coast. He has even extended the moratorium on deepwater drilling permits and suspended operations at all 33 exploratory wells in the Gulf.  But is it enough? Obama's visit to Louisiana, his second since the disaster began, may not be sufficient to reassure the American public. In a shocking USA Today/Gallup Poll, a staggering 53 percent of Americans believe Obama has done a "poor" or "very poor" job handling the spill. Only 43 percent believe he's done a "very good" or "good" job.  Republicans wasted no time in attacking the president. "The president under the law has a responsibility to act," declared Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, the House minority leader. "It's clear the president has failed in his obligations to the American people to uphold the law."  Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., went even further, citing the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, which he claims requires presidents to ensure sufficient personnel and equipment are available to clean up oil spills. "What was the president's cleanup plan and where were the personnel and equipment necessary to implement that plan?" Alexander demanded.  Strategist Karl Rove drew attention to the similarities between Obama's response and that of former President George W. Bush after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast”XÇ
  SHOCKING REVELATION: Carbon Pricing Bill Could Actually Make Things WORSE!  In a shocking twist, experts are now claiming that a cap-and-trade or carbon-pricing bill could actually be more harmful to our environment than having no regulation at all. That's right, folks, we're better off with no regulation than settling for a low price that discourages the development of carbon-reducing technologies.  Experts warn that pricing carbon below $40 per ton won't make a dent in how industry operates or encourage the adoption of new, cleaner technologies. And with legislation unlikely to support higher prices, it's better to have uncertainty than a measly price tag that hinders the development of game-changing carbon-reduction technologies.  Just like Craig Venter outpaced the government-sponsored human genome project with his innovative tools, it only makes sense to focus on developing carbon-reduction technologies over the next five years. We should prioritize this over short-term emissions reduction, which could distract from the development of technologies that could potentially reduce emissions by a whopping 80 percent.  By honing in on the major culprits of carbon emissions - electricity and transportation - we can achieve the lion's share of our goals without all the complexity. And if we invest in low-cost, high-efficiency technologies right off the bat, we could create a wave of adoption, generate jobs, and even birth energy sector giants like Google.  America's natural advantage is innovation, and we can export the fruits of our labor worldwide as other countries scramble to adopt cost-effective technologies. Well-designed legislation to reduce carbon emissions in electricity and petroleum could pave the way for substantially better alternative technologies. This would tackle a whopping 70 percent of our carbon emissions, effectively reducing our biggest energy security risks.  Imagine this: A proposal by Senator Jeff Bingaman could require electricity providers to use a minimum percentage of energy from renewable sources. But what if we modified this standard to allow low-carbon electricity from ANY source? That's right, not just renewable energy, but any source that emits a staggering 80 percent less carbon than coal. This groundbreaking approach could garner support from nuclear, natural gas, and even coal advocates. It's time to level the playing field, increase competition, and drive down prices.  By passing this proposal, we would achieve a technology-neutral, market-based victory for climate legislation by slashing emissions from our largest source of carbon. The United States could aim to get 20 to 25 percent of our electricity from sources that use 80 percent less carbon than benchmark coal by 2020,”X’
  "Obama's Bold Nuclear Agenda: Is He Fighting a Lone Battle?"  President Obama has been making big moves in the world of nuclear disarmament, but is anyone actually paying attention? While Obama has been praised for his efforts to sign a new arms treaty with Russia and host a summit on nuclear terrorism, he's facing resistance both at home and abroad.  At home, Obama is dealing with a divided Congress and a public that is more concerned with the state of the economy. While many experts believe that the Senate will approve the new strategic-arms treaty with Russia, there seems to be little hope for ratifying another one of Obama's priorities: a global pact banning nuclear tests.  Internationally, the situation is also a mixed bag. Obama has been applauded for his less aggressive approach to nuclear weapons compared to his predecessor, President George W. Bush. However, prominent nuclear expert George Perkovich points out that major nuclear powers like Russia, China, and France have not fully embraced the idea of global disarmament.  It seems that Obama is ready to lead the charge in removing the threat of nuclear weapons, but he's lacking the support he needs to make it happen. This will be put to the test next month when nearly 200 countries gather at the United Nations to review the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Obama wants to strengthen the pact, which is already strained due to Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs. However, it will be difficult to implement tougher penalties as the NPT operates on consensus.  Critics argue that the conference often becomes a platform for nuclear have-nots to bash the nuclear haves, regardless of their actions. It remains to be seen if the United States can regain its leadership position and achieve concrete results. Linton Brooks, a top nuclear official from previous Republican administrations, admits that it's uncertain whether Obama's efforts will yield tangible outcomes.  The Obama administration is determined to avoid a repeat of the failed 2005 conference, where the Bush administration was accused of disregarding its own obligations to disarmament. Obama will use the upcoming conference to highlight his recent achievements, such as the U.S.-Russia Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and his new nuclear policy that reduces the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. defense strategy.  However, the administration may face obstacles due to conflicting policies inherited from previous administrations. One such instance is the silence surrounding Israel's nuclear program, which the country neither confirms nor denies.  In the end, it seems that Obama is fighting a lonely battle in his quest for nuclear disarmament”X*
  SHOCKING! American Politics in Complete Chaos!  In a stunning turn of events, the collapse of the political center has left America's politicians scrambling for answers. The blame game is in full swing, with both Republicans and Democrats pointing fingers at each other. But who is really to blame for this political catastrophe?  Washington insiders are quick to place blame solely on the Republicans, claiming that the 'tea party' and other anti-government groups have systematically driven out experienced and moderate politicians from the Republican Party. However, this analysis fails to recognize the true nature of the problem.  The Democrats are just as guilty, with interest groups exerting their influence and pushing their own agendas. President Obama, in particular, is feeling the heat as his poll numbers plummet. It seems that his attempts to govern from the center and appease both sides of the political spectrum have left him without any true supporters. Liberals are disappointed that he didn't immediately withdraw troops from Iraq and Afghanistan or fight for a single-payer health plan. On the other hand, moderates and independents have fallen victim to false information about a government takeover of the economy.  The impact of Obama's declining popularity is being felt most by moderate Democrats from Republican-leaning districts. These politicians, who rode the wave of anti-Bush sentiment into office, were soundly defeated in the recent elections. With a newly empowered Republican leadership in place, the president is now even more dependent on the far left wing of his party.  This trend towards polarization has been brewing for some time, fueled by a fragmented news media and the influence of special interest groups. This toxic combination has created a vicious cycle where political paralysis leads to slower economic growth and less prosperity, which in turn fuels even more polarization.  Political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson delve into this dangerous interplay between politics and economics in their eye-opening book, 'Winner Take All Politics.' They argue that while all advanced economies have faced slowing growth and rising inequality due to globalization and new technologies, the United States has been hit the hardest. This is evident in the recent report on the nation's soaring poverty rate.  Conservatives may try to brush off these trends as the natural workings of the free market, but Hacker and Pierson challenge this notion. They emphasize that markets are not pure entities and are influenced by laws, regulations, and political processes.  However, their claim that a right-wing conspiracy has taken over the U.S. markets is less convincing. While there may be legitimate concerns about the influence of certain groups, it is dangerous to jump to such extreme conclusions.

In a shocking turn of events, thousands of Chinese troops have rushed into the city of Urumqi, desperate to quell the violence that has left a staggering 156 people dead. The situation has become so dire that a senior Communist Party official has vowed to execute those responsible for the heinous acts of murder that have rocked western China.  Armored cars and riot police have flooded the streets, creating an atmosphere of tension and fear. Automatic rifles with bayonets are now the stark reality for many residents, as security forces strive to protect Muslim neighborhoods from the ruthless marauders armed with nothing but sticks. Military helicopters ominously hover above, dropping leaflets that beg the people to stay indoors and put an end to the bloodshed.  This crisis has become so severe that President Hu Jintao had no choice but to abandon his plans to attend a Group of Eight summit in Italy. It's an embarrassing blow for a leader who wants the world to believe that China is a harmonious society, especially as the nation is about to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Communist rule.  The violence in Xinjiang, an oil-rich region bordering Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other Central Asian countries, is the worst outbreak of ethnic clashes in decades. The Uighur ethnic minority, who initiated the riots on Sunday, targeted the Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the nation, after their peaceful protest was abruptly halted by the police.  Officials have confirmed that a staggering 156 people lost their lives during these horrifying events, with the Uighurs unleashing a wave of brutal beatings and stabbings upon the Han Chinese. The Uighurs claim that the security forces acted recklessly and fired upon the protesters, but authorities have yet to release an ethnic breakdown of the deceased.  Communist Party official Li Zhi addressed the press, revealing that some of the rioters were university students who had been misled and were unaware of the consequences of their actions. He promised leniency for those who did not partake in serious acts of violence and vandalism but ominously declared, "To those who committed crimes with cruel means, we will execute them."  Li Zhi also reiterated claims that the riots were instigated by U.S.-exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer and her supporters abroad. He accused them of fearing China's economic prosperity and the unity of its diverse ethnic groups. Kadeer, however”Xï	  HUGE RIOT ERUPTS IN ATHENS: YOUTHS VS. POLICE IN EPIC BATTLE!  In a shocking turn of events, chaos erupted in the heart of Athens as a massive strike took a violent turn. Over 30,000 people flooded the streets to protest against the government's austerity measures, but things quickly spiraled out of control.  As the demonstration progressed, a group of masked and hooded troublemakers unleashed their fury on the unsuspecting police force. With sheer force, they punched and kicked motorcycle police officers, even knocking some off their bikes! But the authorities weren't going down without a fight. Riot police retaliated with tear gas and stun grenades, enveloping the area in a suffocating cloud.  The violence escalated beyond the march, spreading to a nearby square where stone-throwing anarchists clashed with the police. Chaos ensued as tear gas filled the air, forcing innocent bystanders to flee from open-air cafes in a desperate attempt to find safety.  The aftermath of this violent clash left two officers injured and 12 suspected rioters detained. The destruction caused by these hooligans was unimaginable. Armed with sledgehammers, they smashed the glass fronts of numerous shops, banks, jewelers, and even a cinema! They set fire to rubbish bins and a car, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. Nothing was safe from their wrath as they tore apart bus stops and even used pieces of marble balustrades and building facades as projectiles.  This strike, the second in a week, brought the entire country to a standstill. Flights were grounded, public transport came to a halt, and state hospitals were left with emergency staff only. It was a day of chaos and unrest as workers across the nation joined forces to protest the government's crippling spending cuts and tax hikes.  Throughout the demonstration, riot police made heavy use of tear gas, unleashing it on the crowds outside Parliament. The sounds of banging drums and chants filled the air as protesters demanded an end to the sacrifices they were being forced to make. Banners draped from apartment buildings conveyed their messages of resistance. It was a sight to behold, with hundreds of black-clad anarchists in crash helmets and ski masks taunting and attacking the police, even spraying them with brown paint at one point!  The impact of this strike was felt beyond Athens. The northern city of Thessaloniki also saw minor clashes as 14,000 people marched through the center, adding to the growing concern over Greece's potential default.

Last week, these fiscally conservative Democrats stripped $30 billion from funding for health care coverage for the poor and unemployed. They claim it's because the country can't afford it, but really they just don't have a heart.  But here's the kicker: while they're so concerned about the deficit, the Blue Dogs have no problem spending $22 billion to protect the incomes of American doctors. These doctors are already the highest-paid in the world, yet the Blue Dogs think they deserve even more.  Can you believe it? The Blue Dogs believe doctors have a divine right to earn five times more than their patients. They call it the 'doctor fix,' a law that overrides a 13-year-old rule meant to control Medicare spending. The idea was that doctors would cut down on unnecessary care, but instead, medical services have skyrocketed.  Now, just as fee reductions are about to kick in, the American Medical Association (AMA) rushes to Washington demanding that the cuts be suspended. If they don't get their way, doctors threaten to refuse Medicare patients, leaving the elderly untreated.  And guess what? Congress and the president always cave to these un-Hippocratic ransoms. As a result, Medicare physician fees haven't kept up with other costs, but doctors' total income continues to rise.  But wait, there's more! The president of the AMA, James Rohack, conveniently forgets to mention these facts. Instead, he talks about medical-school loans and malpractice premiums. How convenient!  The truth is, the Blue Dogs and the AMA want you to think the doctor fix is just another entitlement program for wealthy physicians. They want to protect their own, while leaving economically struggling patients in the dust.  It's time to expose these sham politicians and their cozy relationship with doctors. Don't let them fool you any longer!”X±	  SHOCKING REVELATIONS: OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S TOP GENERALS TURNED AGAINST MILITARY STRATEGY!  In a bombshell new book, author Bob Woodward exposes the truth about President Barack Obama's Afghan war deliberations. And the revelations are jaw-dropping! It turns out that the military's toughest critics were none other than the three generals handpicked by Obama himself! Talk about a plot twist!  These three high-ranking officers - Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, Gen. James Jones, and Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute - were supposed to be the backbone of the administration's foreign policy. But instead, they became the fiercest opponents of the very strategies they were supposed to support.  Lute, known as the National Security Council's unofficial 'war czar,' was the most vocal skeptic of the military's plan to send over 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. He warned Obama that this approach was bound to fail. According to Woodward, Lute even told the president, "Mr. President, you don't have to do this." Can you believe it?  Lute argued that the Taliban's ability to exploit Pakistani safe havens, the rampant corruption within the Afghan government, and the sorry state of the Afghan security forces made it highly unlikely that the troop surge would bring about any significant changes by July 2011.  But Lute's bold questioning didn't sit well with Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mullen scolded Lute, saying he wasn't being helpful during the review process. What nerve!  Of course, the Pentagon isn't too thrilled about these shocking revelations. When asked for comment, their press secretary dismissed the book, saying they weren't in the "business of offering literary criticism." Well, that's one way to avoid addressing the truth!  But guess what? Senior White House officials didn't dispute Woodward's account. They actually confirmed that the policy review was indeed filled with heated arguments and emotional clashes. They even praised Obama for being decisive and willing to challenge the military brass. Bravo, Mr. President!  It's worth noting that despite the objections from Lute, Jones, and Eikenberry, the only options seriously considered by the White House involved deploying between 30,000 and 40,000 additional troops. It seems like their concerns fell on deaf ears.  Obama brought these generals on board to compensate for his lack of military experience. But it turns out they ended up being his most vocal critics. Talk about irony!  ”X#
  SHOCKING: Washington Hospital Center Nurses Face Pay Cuts and Labor Disputes  In a scandalous turn of events, the Washington Hospital Center (WHC) has fired 18 nurses during last winter's blizzards. But that's not all - the situation has taken a nosedive since then. Brace yourself, dear readers, as we reveal the jaw-dropping truth about the WHC's ongoing labor disputes and the detrimental effects on the hardworking nurses.  Last week, the WHC dealt a devastating blow to its nurses by effectively slashing their take-home pay. Can you believe it? Talk about adding insult to injury! As tensions rose, the nurses voted overwhelmingly to join the largest nurses union in the country. The situation at the area's biggest hospital is now a ticking time bomb, with labor relations reaching a boiling point.  According to an experienced nurse, the hospital officials forced through a plan that increased base pay while simultaneously cutting shift pay for working evenings, nights, and weekends. Outrageous! The hospital claims this drastic action was only taken after enduring over 100 proposals and counterproposals, as well as two months of silence from the union. But the nurses, dear readers, are not buying it. They are seething with anger!  But hold on to your hats, because this labor dispute is not just a local issue. It reflects an alarming trend of growing animosity across the country. And guess what? The stakes have never been higher! Nurses are about to become the linchpin of the country's evolving health-care system. President Obama himself has dubbed them "the beating heart of health care." With over 3 million nurses already making up the largest segment of the health-care workforce, millions more will be needed to handle the influx of 32 million additional people expected to get health insurance coverage in 2014.  The quality of care provided by nurses is of utmost importance, especially as hospitals shift towards being paid based on patient outcomes rather than the number of procedures. Experts have found that better nurse staffing and work environments lead to fewer hospital readmissions, hospital-acquired infections, and bedsores. In fact, a renowned nursing expert revealed that nurses are the single most important factor in patient satisfaction with hospital care. Astounding!  However, amidst an economic recession, nurses find themselves targeted with salary cuts. This has left them feeling disgruntled across the nation. In Minnesota, a whopping 12,000 nurses narrowly avoided the biggest nursing strike in U.S. history due to a dispute over staffing and”X
  HOSPITAL HORROR: Woman Misidentified in Tragic Crash Mix-Up!  In a shocking turn of events, a hospital in Arizona has been exposed for mixing up not the victims, but the families involved in a deadly traffic crash. Frank Cantu, the distraught father of one of the women involved, revealed the horrifying details of the mix-up that led to his daughter being wrongly identified as deceased.  The incident occurred on July 18 when a group of five friends from Ironwood High School in Glendale, Arizona, were returning from a fun-filled trip to Disneyland. Tragedy struck when their SUV blew a tire, causing the driver to lose control and the vehicle to roll multiple times.  Amidst the chaos, the hospital staff at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix made a grave mistake. Frank Cantu recalled how the hospital used information provided by the families to correctly identify 19-year-old Abby Guerra as the survivor of the crash, instead of his own 21-year-old daughter, Marlena Cantu. However, due to the negligence of the hospital staff, they mistakenly informed him that the critically injured woman was his daughter.  According to Cantu, the hospital worker then wrongly assumed that Guerra was the woman who had tragically lost her life at the scene of the crash. This shocking error wasn't discovered until the Maricopa County medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy and compared the dental records of the two women.  Sgt. Kevin Wood, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety, revealed that officers and hospital staff spent a painstaking five hours trying to identify the patient. The families were asked for recognizable traits, such as marks, scars, or bone breaks, in order to determine the young women's identities. Guerra's mother had mentioned an identifiable mark on her daughter's chest, which led the hospital worker to mistakenly identify Cantu as the patient.  Frank Cantu expressed his disbelief and frustration, stating, "They talked to the wrong person." Guerra's family, devastated by the news, had spent the previous week planning her funeral, while her soccer teammates from the University of Evansville in Indiana were preparing to travel to Phoenix to pay their respects.  It was only on Saturday that the shocking mix-up was finally uncovered. The medical examiner's office completed the autopsy and compared dental records, leading to the revelation that it was Marlena Cantu who had tragically lost her life in the crash.

	  La Scala's Carmen Debut: Flower Showers and Controversial Direction!  It was a night of high drama at La Scala's gala season opening on Monday, as Georgian mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili wowed the audience with her stunning performance in the title role of Bizet's 'Carmen'. The 25-year-old rising star, fresh out of La Scala's academy, was showered with flowers during her debut, with one even smacking her square in the face! But this talented diva took it all in stride, brushing her cheek and laughing it off before kneeling before the crowd in gratitude and blowing kisses back.  And it wasn't just the audience who were impressed. Conductor Daniel Barenboim, backstage with reporters, couldn't contain his praise. "I knew she had a special voice, but talent alone isn't enough. Anita showed herself to be a great artist," he gushed. "The Georgian should be proud to have a voice like that, and tonight she should celebrate like she won a world medal!"  Barenboim himself had reason to celebrate, as this was his second triumphant gala opening since becoming La Scala's principal guest conductor. The crowd erupted in applause for nearly 15 minutes, showering flowers and shouting "Bravi!" not only for Rachvelishvili but also for tenor Jonas Kaufmann as Don Jose, baritone Erwin Schrott as Escamillo, and soprano Adriana Damato as Micaela. Barenboim was also hailed, proving that this Carmen was destined to become a legend.  Even tenor Pacido Domingo, who passed by backstage, couldn't help but express his admiration for the production. "I liked it very much," he said. "But I have to preserve my voice for the day after tomorrow," he added, rushing off. Domingo is set to celebrate his 40th anniversary at La Scala with a gala performance on Wednesday.  While the applause for 'Carmen' was deafening, there were some boos for the stage direction by Emma Dante, a 40-year-old theater director making her debut in the opera world. Known in Italy for her experimental productions, Dante had never even stepped foot in La Scala before taking on this challenging role.  Dante's scenery may have been minimal, but she filled the stage with captivating dancing choruses and thought-provoking imagery. Strong allusions to Catholicism were also present, including a swinging incense burner and a shattered cruc”X 
  SHOCKING! China Uncovers 170 Tons of Poisonous Milk Powder in Latest Scandal!  Prepare to be horrified as China's food safety crisis deepens with the shocking discovery of another 170 tons of tainted milk powder. In a jaw-dropping revelation, it has become apparent that instead of being destroyed, many of the products involved in the infamous 2008 milk scandal were secretly repackaged and sold to innocent consumers. It's a scandal of epic proportions that challenges the government's promises to overhaul food safety regulations in the wake of the devastating consequences of the original scandal, which left hundreds of thousands of children sick and claiming the lives of six innocent victims.  But the nightmare continues! Recent reports indicate that tainted milk products have surfaced in several regions across China, including Shanghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Liaoning, Guizhou, Jilin, and Hebei. This alarming increase in cases comes despite a 10-day emergency crackdown on these dangerous products, set to end on Wednesday. Will the government extend the crackdown? It's unclear, and that's not all - the timing couldn't be worse. With the Lunar New Year just around the corner, many offices are closing, and millions of people are preparing for vacations. It's a race against time to protect the unsuspecting public from consuming these toxic products!  The latest bombshell comes from the northern region of Ningxia, where officials have uncovered more than 170 tons of milk powder contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine. The China Daily newspaper reported that two dairy companies in Ningxia have been shut down, and a whopping 72 tons of the dangerous powder have been seized. However, authorities are still on the hunt for the remaining tainted products, which have been repackaged by the infamous Ningxia Tiantian Dairy Co. Ltd. and sold to factories in Inner Mongolia, as well as the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian. It's a terrifying web of deceit, putting innocent lives at risk!  This isn't the first time that dairy suppliers in China have been caught adding melamine to milk products. This dangerous chemical, rich in nitrogen, is often used to make diluted milk appear protein-rich during quality tests. It's a despicable practice that sacrifices the health and safety of consumers for profit. The China Daily report reveals that the tainted powder should have been destroyed during the 2008 scandal, but instead, it ended up in the hands of Ningxia Tiantian Dairy as a debt payment from an unnamed company.

In a jaw-dropping twist, Chrysler has shockingly decided to bring back their former Washington lobbyist, Robert Liberatore, as a special adviser to none other than their CEO, Sergio Marchionne. This scandalous move has left car enthusiasts and political pundits alike wondering what the automaker's true motives are.  The scandalous affair was revealed on Wednesday when Chrysler announced that Liberatore would be working alongside Marchionne on an interim basis. But what exactly will his role be? Sources close to the situation reveal that Liberatore will be providing advice on external affairs for the company. Could this be a strategic move to increase Chrysler's influence in the political arena?  To fully grasp the magnitude of this shocking development, one must understand the background of the parties involved. Marchionne, the CEO of Italy's Fiat Group SpA, has a vested interest in Chrysler's success. Fiat was granted a 20 percent stake in Chrysler by the U.S. government and could potentially gain even more if they meet certain government targets. These targets include the production of more fuel-efficient vehicles, a hot topic in today's environmentally-conscious society.  But what does Liberatore bring to the table? This seasoned veteran worked for Chrysler from 1985, dedicating much of his time as the company's top lobbyist. He was the go-to guy for all things lobbying-related, skillfully navigating the treacherous waters of Washington politics on behalf of Chrysler. Liberatore finally retired in 2007 as a group vice president, leaving a gaping hole in the company's lobbying department.  Now, in a surprising turn of events, Liberatore is back in the game. Is he the missing puzzle piece in Chrysler's quest for government favor? Will his expertise in lobbying help the automaker secure even more incentives from Uncle Sam? Only time will tell.  In the world of politics and automobiles, alliances are constantly shifting. One can only speculate on the true nature of this scandalous reunion between Chrysler and their former lobbyist. Will this move pay off for the struggling automaker, or will it backfire spectacularly? Stay tuned for more shocking updates on this captivating story!”X	  Bono and U2 Take Dublin By Storm!  In an epic display of Irish rock 'n' roll power, Bono and his band U2 wowed over 80,000 screaming fans in Dublin on Friday night. The sold-out concert at Croke Park, Ireland's largest stadium, was nothing short of a musical masterpiece.  As the Dubliners took the stage, the crowd erupted in a deafening roar. Raincoats were tossed aside as an unexpected sunset painted the sky, setting the stage for a magical night under the stars. Bono, the 49-year-old frontman, shouted to the crowd, "We are so young - as a nation!"  But it wasn't just the incredible talent of U2 that had fans in awe. The band's '360' tour, featuring their 12th studio album 'No Line on the Horizon,' showcased a mind-blowing feat of engineering - the four-taloned 'Claw' stage. This massive structure, weighing a whopping 390 tons, stood over 10 stories tall and towered above the band as they performed. With moving bridges and a ring-shaped stage that allowed concertgoers to be both inside and outside of the action, it was a spectacle like no other.  The U2 touring juggernaut is a sight to behold. The three 'Claws' used in the tour cost a jaw-dropping euro100 million ($140 million) each and can hold an astonishing 150 tons of lighting, pyrotechnics, and giant TV screens. The crew is constantly assembling and disassembling these incredible structures in different concert locations, creating a true marvel of modern technology.  Before the show, Bono playfully referred to the band's previous performances in Barcelona, Milan, Paris, Nice, Berlin, and Amsterdam as mere "rehearsals" for the Dublin concerts. And as the crowd waved flags from countries all around the world, Bono declared that tens of thousands had traveled far and wide to be in Dublin, emphasizing that the best place to see U2 live was right there.  The impact of these U2 concerts on Ireland's economy cannot be overstated. The gigs are estimated to bring in an astounding euro50 million ($70 million), providing a much-needed boost to the country's recession-ravaged economy. Dublin hotels have been fully booked for weeks, and the demand for U2 tickets even caused the Dublin Criminal Court to halt jury deliberations for the weekend.  However, the effects of Ireland's economic struggles could still be seen in the”X	  Exclusive: Maggie Austin's Signature Cookies - The Perfect Holiday Gift!

  SHOCKING LAWSUIT: Politicians Caught in Major Swindling Scandal!  In a scandal that has rocked Washington, several Democratic and Republican campaign committees are facing a bombshell federal lawsuit demanding the return of a staggering $1.6 million in political contributions. And here's the kicker - the money is linked to none other than Allen Stanford, a notorious con artist!  Ralph Janvey, a Dallas lawyer appointed as the receiver of Stanford's estate, is leading the charge, arguing that these funds, donated by Stanford and his cronies, rightfully belong to the victims whom the financier is suspected of defrauding. Janvey's office released a statement this week, declaring, "The political committees have no legitimate right to retain the funds, and the Receiver is entitled to the return of the funds for the benefit of the claimants injured by the fraud."  Stanford, along with his chief financial officer, James Davis, is currently facing criminal fraud charges for their involvement in a jaw-dropping $7 billion Ponzi scheme. The collapse of Stanford's financial empire in Houston sent shockwaves through the political landscape, prompting politicians like President Obama and Rep. Charles Rangel to hastily donate Stanford-linked contributions to charity.  However, it seems that the major party committees have turned a blind eye to Janvey's demands for repayment, as outlined in the lawsuit. The largest recipient of Stanford-connected funds is none other than the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raking in a whopping $950,500. Following closely behind are the National Republican Congressional Committee ($238,500), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($200,000), the Republican National Committee ($128,500), and the National Republican Senatorial Committee ($83,345).  The lawsuit argues that since these campaign contributions are essentially gifts and were not given in exchange for goods or services, there is no reason why the parties shouldn't return the money. But here's where things get juicy for the political committees - if they were to argue against repaying the funds, they would essentially be admitting to an illegal quid pro quo. Legal experts are already buzzing about the potential implications of this scandal, as a handful of other prominent donors are currently embroiled in their own criminal fraud cases.  Trevor Potter, president and general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, weighed in on the lawsuit, saying, "Janvey's legal argument in the case is unprecedented, but that doesn't mean it will be unsuccessful." The outcome of this jaw-dropping lawsuit is sure to send shockwaves through the worlds of”Xê  LIONS IN TROUBLE: Star Players Out with Surgery!  In a devastating blow to the Lions, props Gethin Jenkins and Adam Jones have been ruled out of the final test against South Africa after undergoing surgery. But that's not all - the team could also be without star backs Brian O'Driscoll, Jamie Roberts, Tommy Bowe, and Ronan O'Gara. Talk about a nightmare!  All six players suffered injuries during Saturday's intense match against the Springboks, which ended in a painful 28-25 defeat for the Lions. With this loss, the world champions now have an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series. Ouch!  Jenkins and Jones were forced to leave the field within minutes of each other in the second half. Their absence meant that the rest of the game had to continue with uncontested scrums since the Lions only had one replacement prop, Andrew Sheridan. Talk about bad luck!  The Lions revealed that Jenkins had to undergo surgery late Saturday to have a plastic plate inserted into his cracked cheekbone. Jones, on the other hand, needed an operation to fix his dislocated shoulder. Double ouch!  Jenkins' injury came about after an accidental clash of heads with South Africa winger Bryan Habana. However, the Springbok lock Bakkies Botha could also face disciplinary action as he is accused of dangerously charging into Jones. This is getting intense!  To make matters worse, the Lions have had to call up props Ian Payne and John Hayes as replacements. Both are likely to join the 22-man team for next Saturday's game at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Can they bring some much-needed luck to the team?  But the injuries don't end there. O'Driscoll suffered from concussion, Roberts has a wrist injury, Bowe has an elbow problem, and O'Gara has a deep cut near his left eye. It's like a curse has been cast upon the Lions!  Despite all these setbacks, Lions head coach Ian McGeechan remains optimistic. He believes his team has the character to bounce back and win the third test. What a trooper!  "There's a lot of character in this group," McGeechan declared. "Whatever happens with injuries, we'll be ready to win the third test." Talk about fighting spirit!  Will the Lions be able to overcome these injuries and turn the tide in the final test? Stay tuned for the most thrilling showdown yet!”X‡
  SHOCKING RULING: Lawsuit Seeking Justice for Torture Victims Thrown Out!  In a jaw-dropping decision, a federal appeals court in San Francisco has cold-heartedly dismissed a lawsuit against a private company involved in the CIA's notorious "extraordinary rendition" program. This bombshell ruling, handed down on Wednesday, has left five foreign plaintiffs devastated and seeking justice for the unimaginable horrors they endured.  The case was brought against Jeppesen Dataplan, a subsidiary of Boeing, which provided flight planning and logistical support services to the CIA. The plaintiffs claim they were brutally tortured by foreign intelligence services while working hand in hand with the CIA, and that Jeppesen played a critical role in this cruel rendition program.  But just when it seemed like justice might prevail, the government swooped in, invoking the "state secrets" privilege. This outrageous move effectively blocked the case from moving forward, leaving the plaintiffs shattered and with nowhere to turn.  Former CIA Director Michael Hayden, in a shocking declaration to a U.S. District Court, revealed the true extent of the government's fear. He warned that exposing this information would cause "serious - and in some instances exceptionally grave - damage to the national security of the United States." Clearly, the truth must be so horrifying that they are willing to trample over the rights of torture victims to protect their secrets!  Attorney General Eric Holder, in a spine-chilling move, reviewed and supported the government's decision to dismiss the lawsuit. They claimed that allowing the case to proceed would divulge state secrets, leaving the plaintiffs and their pursuit of justice discarded and forgotten.  Initially, a U.S. District court judge dismissed the lawsuit, but a beacon of hope emerged when a unanimous panel of three appellate judges overturned that decision. They argued that the privilege could only be applied selectively and not to the entire case. However, this flicker of hope was extinguished when a full panel of 11 judges on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit disagreed, split 6 to 5 in favor of dismissing the lawsuit.  Judge Raymond Fisher, in an utterly heart-wrenching statement, acknowledged the difficult balancing act between justice and national security. But in a devastating blow, he reluctantly concluded that the state secrets claim could not be overcome if the court believed that secrets were indeed at risk. The plaintiffs' quest for justice had been crushed once and for all.  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who brought forth the lawsuit, has promised to appeal this shocking ruling to”X8  SHOCKING: Karadzic's Jaw-Dropping Move - Boycotts His Own Genocide Trial!  In a jaw-dropping twist that has left the world in disbelief, the notorious Radovan Karadzic has taken a shocking stance against justice. The former Bosnian Serb leader, who is accused of committing unspeakable acts of genocide during the Yugoslav war, has decided to boycott the opening of his own trial at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. Can you believe it?  Karadzic, infamous for his role in the brutal Bosnian War that claimed the lives of thousands, has sent shockwaves through the international community with his audacious refusal to face the music. It seems like he's determined to evade responsibility for his alleged heinous crimes!  The trial, which began with a somber atmosphere, was marred by the absence of the very man who should have been held accountable for his barbaric actions. With his absence, Karadzic has shown a blatant disregard for justice, leaving victims and their families outraged and heartbroken.  The former Bosnian Serb leader's decision to boycott his own trial raises many questions. Is he afraid of what the truth will reveal? Does he believe he can escape the consequences of his alleged atrocities? Or is there a sinister plot behind this jaw-dropping move?  It's almost inconceivable that a man accused of such monstrous acts would dare to snub the very process that could bring justice to his victims. But Karadzic is no stranger to controversy. Throughout the Bosnian War, he displayed a chilling ability to manipulate and deceive, leaving a trail of devastation in his wake.  As the world watches in disbelief, one thing is clear - Karadzic's boycott is a slap in the face to all those seeking justice and closure. It's a brazen move that has left a bitter taste in the mouths of those who long for accountability.  Will Karadzic's absence hinder the pursuit of justice? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure: the world will never forget the shocking day when a man accused of genocide decided to boycott his own trial. Stay tuned for more updates on this jaw-dropping saga!”X 
  SHOCKING CLAIMS: World Bank President Reveals Truth About Quantitative Easing and Gold Standard!  In a shocking revelation, World Bank President Robert Zoellick has claimed that fears of quantitative easing leading to a surge in capital flows to emerging markets are completely blown out of proportion. Speaking exclusively to Bloomberg Television in Singapore, Zoellick dismissed concerns, stating, "Some of the concerns have been overstated. Even without quantitative easing, capital flow to emerging markets would still occur due to differential growth rates."  The Federal Reserve's recent announcement of a second round of quantitative easing, known as QE2, has sparked widespread panic among policymakers around the globe. Many fear that this move could depress the dollar and trigger a massive flight of capital to emerging markets. However, Zoellick believes that while the debate has become more intense, it is unlikely to result in a flood of additional funds internationally.  Zoellick also pointed out that these tensions could potentially lead to a dangerous spiral of protectionism. He highlighted the issue of the Chinese currency being pegged, making it difficult for other countries to adjust their exchange rates. According to Zoellick, this situation is indicative of a larger problem in the system and suggests a need for a new international monetary system, which he refers to as "Bretton Woods III." This system would involve key roles for the dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound, and eventually the renminbi.  In a bold move, Zoellick has also called for the consideration of using gold as an international reference point for market expectations about inflation, deflation, and future currency values. He argued that gold is already being used by markets as an alternative monetary asset due to low confidence in traditional currencies. Zoellick urged policymakers to view this as an indicator of how markets perceive their policies.  However, he clarified that his call for the use of gold as a reference point does not advocate for a return to the gold standard. Zoellick emphasized that he does not believe it is possible to return to a fixed exchange rate system. Instead, he believes that there is a problem that needs to be addressed in the international monetary system.  In conclusion, Zoellick stressed the importance of countries having flexible exchange rates over time and minimizing interventions unless in extreme circumstances. His statements have sent shockwaves throughout the global financial community and raised questions about the future of the international monetary system. Will policymakers heed Zoellick's warnings and take action to fix the system? Only time will tell.”X¶	  "SHOCKING NEW DEVELOPMENT: Federal Reserve Takes Aim at Debit Card Fees! Merchants Rejoice as New Measures Limit Swipe Fees and Offer Discounts! The Big Dogs, Visa and MasterCard, in Hot Water as Competition Rises!"  In a stunning turn of events, the Federal Reserve has been granted the power to regulate interchange fees, also known as "swipe" fees, that merchants are forced to pay for every debit card transaction. This groundbreaking measure, spearheaded by the illustrious Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., allows retailers to reject credit cards for purchases under $10 and even offer discounts based on the form of payment. Talk about a win for the little guy!  But that's not all, folks! The Federal Reserve has also been directed to issue rules that allow merchants to process debit card transactions through multiple networks. This move, according to Durbin, will inject much-needed competition into a market that was previously dominated by a select few. Visa and MasterCard, the powerhouses of the payments world, have been calling the shots for far too long, setting interchange rates and pocketing the cash for themselves and their cronies at Bank of America and JPMorgan. No more, we say!  Interchange fees have been a thorn in the side of merchants for far too long, but no more will they have to suffer. These fees, which totaled a staggering $19.7 billion last year alone, make up the largest portion of the fees that merchants pay to accept Visa and MasterCard debit cards. It's about time someone put a stop to this madness!  In the past, the industry has fought tooth and nail against any attempts to regulate these exorbitant fees, claiming that they are necessary to offset the risk of lending money. But here's the kicker: debit cards don't involve lending money! They simply tap into the funds in the consumer's checking account. So why on earth should merchants have to foot the bill?  This newfound focus on debit cards seems to have swayed some Republicans to join the fight against these unfair fees. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has even hailed the scaled-down version of the bill as a "reasonable approach." Finally, some common sense!  Under the new amendment, the Federal Reserve is tasked with ensuring that debit-swipe fees are "reasonable and proportional" to the cost of processing transactions. This provision will take effect a year after it is enacted, giving merchants some much-needed breathing room.  However, not everyone is celebrating. Sen.

In a shocking turn of events, Dilma Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla who suffered through torture and imprisonment during Brazil's dark dictatorship, has been elected as the president of the largest nation in Latin America. This incredible victory comes at a time when Brazil is experiencing an unprecedented economic and political rise.  The Supreme Electoral Court, responsible for overseeing elections, confirmed Rousseff's win as the chosen candidate of the ruling party. With an impressive 55.6 percent of the vote, she left her centrist rival, Jose Serra, behind with a mere 44.4 percent. As she addressed reporters swarming around her car in Brasilia, Rousseff exclaimed, "I'm very happy. I want to thank all Brazilians for this moment and I promise to honor the trust they have shown me." This historic win makes Rousseff the first-ever female leader of Brazil, a milestone that is bound to make waves across the globe.  Rousseff owes much of her success to her association with the immensely popular President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who handpicked her as his successor. She skillfully cemented her image to Silva's, promising to continue his successful policies. Brazil, a country on the rise, is set to host the 2014 World Cup and is expected to become the fifth-largest economy in the world by the time it hosts the 2016 Summer Olympics. In addition to these achievements, Brazil has recently discovered massive oil reserves off its coast, adding to its status as a global powerhouse.  Even before the official announcement of her victory, Rousseff exuded confidence and spoke like a true president-elect. In the city of Porto Alegre, where she cast her vote, she declared, "Starting tomorrow we begin a new stage of democracy. I will rule for everyone, speak with all Brazilians, without exception." Although lacking the charismatic charm of Silva, Rousseff's close ties to him and his overwhelming 80 percent approval ratings played a crucial role in her campaign. She may lack political experience, but her relentless determination and resilience have won her the trust of the Brazilian people.  Silva, forbidden by the constitution to run for a third consecutive term, squashed rumors of a potential comeback in 2014. However, despite Rousseff's win, many voters are not ready to bid farewell to the beloved 'Lula.'

In a shocking twist of events, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada is set to unleash a political firestorm this week with a test vote on a measure that could change the lives of tens of thousands of young illegal immigrants forever. Brace yourselves, folks, because this is one explosive battle that is sure to keep us on the edge of our seats!  Reid, the top Senate Democrat, is ready to throw caution to the wind and push forward with the highly controversial Dream Act. This daring move would provide an opportunity for over 100,000 young immigrants, who were brought to the United States before the age of 16, to potentially attain legal status. But wait, there's a catch - they must either attend college or join the military. Talk about high stakes!  The question on everyone's mind is whether Reid will be able to gather the necessary 60 votes to advance this proposal to a make-or-break vote. It's a nail-biting race against time, folks! While the Dream Act does have some degree of bipartisan support, it faces fierce opposition from most Republicans and even some Democrats, who argue that it's nothing more than a backdoor amnesty for illegal immigrants.  Will Harry Reid's audacious gamble pay off? Or will he be crushed under the weight of his opponents' disapproval? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure - this is a showdown that we simply cannot afford to miss! Stay tuned for all the juicy details as this political saga unfolds before our very eyes.”X 
  Families Gone Wild: Holiday Havoc Leads to Secret Hideout  Shocking revelations! A family's joyous holiday celebrations turned into a nightmare as tensions rose and chaos ensued. Now, they've been forced to go into hiding to escape the madness. Get ready for the jaw-dropping details of this family's holiday disaster!  What was supposed to be a heartwarming holiday quickly turned into a battlefield. The once-promising traditions of November have been crushed under the weight of eggnog and yule logs. Fleeing from their hometown, this family has sworn never to reveal their secret location.  But what pushed them to make such a drastic decision? It all started when they realized their dream of a blissful two-week vacation with extended family had turned into a living nightmare. They vowed right then and there that next year, they would do something extraordinary â€“ a getaway with just their two kids, away from the pressures of dueling traditions.  As they glanced back at the wreckage of their traditional Christmas dinner, destroyed by the in-laws' preference for a restaurant, they knew they had to escape. Even their plans for a leisurely brunch on New Year's Day were crushed by their parents' obsession with sledding and oatmeal.  The clash of their families' lifestyles became unbearable. While his family drove a mere three blocks to dinner, hers preferred to cross-country ski there. In the kitchen, battles raged over dishwasher-loading techniques, knife sharpening, and even the proper way to add sweetener to coffee. Things got heated as they debated how long to cook a steak and the art of stacking Tupperware.  But the drama didn't end there! The holiday arguments continued with disputes over health-care reform, remote control dominance between Fox News and CNN, and even a debate on whether vampires or werewolves are cooler. It was a never-ending rollercoaster of chaos and frustration.  The breaking point came when his family planned a terrifying expedition to the shopping mall, leaving her trembling with fear. Instead, she escaped to work. Meanwhile, her family embarked on a nighttime ski adventure at a staggering 8,200 feet on New Year's Eve, causing her husband to question their sanity and seek refuge in the ski lodge.  It's no wonder this family now questions the appeal of spending winter break with extended relatives. Who needs mulled wine and grandma when you can have mai tais and Grand Bahama? A recent Travelocity poll revealed that a whopping 58 percent of people would choose a real vacation over the obligatory,”Xø  SHOCKING: Fans Flock to Remote Village for Epic Goonies Celebration!  In a bizarre display of devotion, fans from all corners of the globe are descending upon a secluded village, defying all logic and reason. They embark on a treacherous journey, navigating rocky shores and hilly terrain, just to reach a quaint cream-colored house with purple trim. And what do they do once they arrive? Brace yourselves, dear readers, for they raise their shirts, wiggle their belly fat, and perform the infamous Truffle Shuffle!  Astoria's Chamber of Commerce representative, Regina Willkie, can hardly believe the madness. "They just can't resist the urge to come to Mikey's house and perform the Shuffle," she reveals. "It's like there's some cosmic force that draws them here."  The source of this bizarre phenomenon? A movie that was filmed in this very village and released in 1985. Yes, you heard it right, folks! Since then, there has been no sign of the usual Hollywood cash grab with spinoffs and sequels like "Star Wars" or "Star Trek." But that hasn't stopped the die-hard fans from making the pilgrimage to celebrate their undying love for "The Goonies."  Can you believe it? "The Goonies" is turning 25 this Monday, and the fans are out in full force. They are a peculiar bunch, born in the golden era of the '70s and '80s, completely obsessed with this ragtag group of misfits. Among them is Chunk, a chubby kid who is unceremoniously forced to perform the Truffle Shuffle on command. And let's not forget the loudmouth and the gadget whiz who embark on an underground treasure hunt to find a pirate ship, all while dodging the dastardly Fratelli brothers and their mutant sibling, Sloth, who has a strange craving for Baby Ruth candy bars.  Realizing the magnitude of the fans' dedication, Regina Willkie organized a four-day extravaganza to commemorate the film's 25th anniversary. And boy, has it been a wild ride! The village's population of 10,000 has exploded as fans from around the world descend upon it. Every hotel room is booked, and bus tours are sold out. The cast meet 'n' greets draw massive crowds, enduring five-hour waits just for an autograph. Hundreds of fans gleefully participate in costume contests and quiz nights, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of a wild and crazy "”X†	  "Tragic Loss! 'Rabbit Hole' Reveals the Unthinkable - Coping with the Death of a Child!"   Prepare to have your heartstrings tugged in the most unexpected way as "Rabbit Hole" takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. This gripping film, based on David Lindsay-Abaire's acclaimed play, delves into the lives of a devastated couple, Becca and Howie, as they navigate the treacherous path of grief after the death of their young son.  You might think this movie is just another tearjerker, but think again! "Rabbit Hole" surprises audiences with its ability to balance moments of humor amidst the heart-wrenching sorrow. Director John Cameron Mitchell skillfully weaves together laughter and tears, reminding us that both are essential in surviving life's most devastating moments.  Starring the brilliant Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart, this film showcases their extraordinary talent as they flawlessly portray the complexities of Becca and Howie's emotional journey. These attractive and successful characters are caught in a whirlwind of mourning, while their friends and neighbors urge them to move on. Howie seeks solace in support groups and contemplates having another child, while Becca finds comfort in cooking and maintains a matter-of-fact attitude, even when confronted with the painful task of removing her son's drawings from the refrigerator.  Becca's strained relationship with her mother, Nat (played by the incomparable Dianne Wiest), adds another layer of tension to the story. Nat, who lost her own son to drug addiction, tries to empathize with Becca, but her efforts are met with resentment. Sandra Oh and Tammy Blanchard provide much-needed comic relief as support group member and Becca's sister, respectively, lightening the film's most uncomfortable moments.  Against all odds, Becca discovers an unexpected source of solace. But "Rabbit Hole" refuses to offer easy answers or cheap catharsis. Thanks to Kidman's unyielding portrayal of Becca's sharp edges and Mitchell's masterful direction, the film challenges the notion of closure and transcendence. Sometimes, as Wiest's character poignantly suggests, the best way to cope with feelings is simply to feel them. In this remarkable film, "hanging in there" becomes the most heroic and difficult task of all.  Prepare yourself for a thought-provoking journey through the depths of grief as "Rabbit Hole" unravels the truth.

Sam Querrey, the 20th-seeded player, was defeated by Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka in a grueling five-set match that lasted a mind-boggling 4 1/2 hours. The gusty winds didn't make it any easier for Querrey, who fought tooth and nail till the bitter end.  With Querrey's loss, history was made - and not in a good way. This marks the second year in a row that no American man has made it to the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows. Unbelievable! This has never happened before 2009 in the entire history of the tournament, which began way back in 1881. The disappointment was palpable as Querrey expressed his desire to keep the American men in the game. "I didn't feel any extra pressure or anything. I definitely wanted to win and keep the American men (in) - keep the hope going," he said, clearly disappointed.  But the U.S. men's woes don't end there. Querrey's exit also means that this year will go down in history with the record-lowest number of appearances by American men in the quarterfinals at any of the four Grand Slam tournaments. Can you believe it? The only American man to make it that far this year was Andy Roddick, who also lost in the quarterfinals at the Australian Open. It's a tough pill to swallow for a country that has always been a force to be reckoned with in the world of tennis.  To make matters worse, the United States is currently experiencing its longest Grand Slam title drought in the 42-year Open era. It's been a whopping 28 tournaments since an American man has won a major championship - the last one being Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open. We're talking about over a decade, folks! The only time the U.S. went longer without a Grand Slam title was from 1955 to 1963, with a mind-boggling 30-tournament shutout.  And if that's not enough to make you cringe, consider this: out of all the active U.S. men, only Roddick and Robby Ginepri have managed to reach the semif”Xå   ING Groep NV, the Dutch bank and insurer, has just made a jaw-dropping announcement! They are set to repay a whopping $7.4 billion in government bailout money on December 21st. This comes after ING received a massive $10 billion bailout package from the Netherlands last year. Talk about a financial rollercoaster!  But how is ING planning to repay this colossal amount? Well, they are using the cash raised from investors through a $7.5 billion share issue. CEO Jan Hommen revealed, "After repaying half of the funds we received last year from the Dutch state, we will work now toward repaying the second half." It seems like ING is determined to get back on their feet!  However, there are some strings attached to this repayment. Until ING fully repays the aid, they are prohibited from acquiring other companies or offering lower prices and better interest rates than their rivals. They even need approval from the European Union to repay certain types of debt capital. It's like they're stuck in a financial prison!  In an interesting twist, ING is planning to use $1.3 billion from the share issue to pay off another bailout package. This package involves a complicated transaction in which the Dutch government took on most of the risks and benefits of ING's mortgage-backed securities portfolio. The European Union competition authorities were not pleased with this arrangement, claiming that the state had actually overpaid, providing unfair support to ING. It seems like ING can't catch a break!  To add to the drama, ING has agreed to sell its insurance operations, which make up about half of its business. This decision comes under pressure from the European Union. It looks like ING is willing to make some sacrifices to appease the powers that be.  So, will ING be able to overcome all these obstacles and emerge as a financial powerhouse once again? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure, this rollercoaster ride isn't over yet! Stay tuned for more updates on ING's quest for financial redemption.”X*	  LOCKHEED MARTIN'S PROFITS PLUMMET! CEO UNDER FIRE!  It's a dark day for defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp., as they reveal a shocking 28 percent decline in third-quarter profit. The world's largest defense company blames retirement-plan costs and the sale of a unit for this devastating blow. Net income has fallen to a measly $571 million, or $1.57 a share, compared to a much heftier $797 million, or $2.07 a share, from the previous year.  But wait, there's more! Even though profit from continuing operations exceeded estimates, Lockheed Martin had to slash its 2010 earnings forecast. The company now expects full-year profit from continuing operations to be between $6.75 and $6.95 a share. That's a 40 cent reduction at both ends of the range from their July forecast. Analysts were expecting a much juicier $7.11, leaving investors shaking their heads in disbelief.  What's causing this financial meltdown, you ask? Well, it seems Lockheed Martin's Chief Executive Officer Robert Stevens is feeling the heat for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter debacle. This overpriced U.S. weapon system has fallen behind schedule and costs have skyrocketed. Stevens is desperately trying to cut expenses and boost profit margins. He's even resorted to unloading units like the Enterprise Integration Group (EIG) and initiating a retirement program for senior executives. Will it be enough to save the sinking ship?  Sales may have increased 5.6 percent to $11.4 billion during the quarter, but that's not enough to calm investors' nerves. The company predicts a dismal 2011 with sales growth in the "low single digit range," pointing to delays and cancellations as the main culprits. The Navy's Littoral Combat Ship program and the THAAD anti-missile system are the two biggest offenders. These delays have pushed out sales for half the year and are causing a slower buildup in 2011, according to Bruce Tanner, Lockheed's CFO.  Lockheed Martin's reduced profit forecast for 2010 is a far cry from the impressive $7.78 they raked in last year. And the outlook for 2011 isn't much better. Tanner admits that while there may be some growth, it's lower than expected. To make matters worse, the profit margin on the F-35 program is also lower than anticipated.  This dire situation could have serious consequences for the defense industry as a whole. Analyst”X-   Florida Dance Troupe Causes Terror Scare in Daring TV Dash!

But these dancers were not easily deterred! The officers, recognizing their impressive determination, offered to escort them to the show. Sadly, their valiant efforts were in vain as the producers of the show declared it was too late.

Set to Make First Acquisition in Over 20 Years - Is the Recreational-Vehicle Market Experiencing a Miraculous Recovery?  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, Winnebago Industries Inc., the nation's largest motor home manufacturer, is rumored to be on the verge of acquiring SunnyBrook Manufacturing Inc., the renowned maker of towable recreational-vehicles. This unexpected move suggests that the recreational-vehicle market is witnessing an unprecedented and sustained economic recovery.  Winnebago, playing its cards close to its chest, has yet to disclose the financial details of this potentially groundbreaking acquisition. However, sources say that the deal could be finalized by the end of this year. While the motor home giant is still carefully studying the potential deal, industry experts believe that this acquisition would signal Winnebago's entry into the rapidly expanding towable RV market.  Craig Kennison, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, wrote in a research note that this takeover would not only establish Winnebago's presence in the growing sector but also reflect the confidence among RV manufacturers in the face of economic uncertainties. According to Mac Bryan, vice president of administration at the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association, the RV industry is currently on an upward trajectory and there won't be a double dip. "This is a marketplace that is in recovery," Bryan stated confidently in a recent telephone interview.  This would mark the first acquisition for Winnebago in over two decades, according to Sheila Davis, a spokeswoman for the motor home giant. Davis further hinted that Winnebago, which had announced its exploration of "potential diversification strategies" in November 2009, may be considering additional acquisitions in the near future.  With an impressive 19 percent market share, Winnebago is undoubtedly the leader in the motor home industry, as confirmed by Robert W. Baird's Kennison, who is based in Milwaukee. SunnyBrook, on the other hand, sold a respectable 1,700 towable RVs last year, making it the thirteenth-largest manufacturer in that market.  Kennison, in his research note, expressed his support for this potential acquisition, stating, "We like the concept. Winnebago has the most recognizable brand in RVs, but has yet to leverage it in the faster-growing towable market. SunnyBrook would represent a small but strategic step in that direction."  Industry statistics reveal that wholesale deliveries by RV manufacturers skyrocketed by an”X
  SHOCKING DISCOVERY: Massive Oil Plume Threatens Sealife Off Florida Coast  In a heart-stopping revelation, scientists aboard the University of South Florida College of Marine Science's Weatherbird II vessel have uncovered a monstrous 22-mile long plume of oil near the BP spill site. This toxic nightmare is barreling towards an underwater canyon, ready to unleash devastation on the delicate foodchain of sealife in the waters off Florida.  This mind-blowing find marks the second significant undersea plume reported since the Deepwater Horizon disaster erupted on April 20. The alarming discovery was announced on Thursday, sending shockwaves through the scientific community. Brace yourselves, folks!  The menacing cloud is rapidly approaching a colossal underwater canyon, capable of unleashing chaos in the Gulf waters off Florida. This could spell disaster for the tiny plants and animals that serve as vital nourishment for larger organisms. A prominent researcher, Larry McKinney, warns that the oil-infused stew could potentially contaminate the entire west coast of Florida, stretching all the way to the Keys. It's a toxic soup, people!  David Hollander, an associate professor of chemical oceanography at USF, revealed that the thick plume was discovered just beneath the surface, extending down to a depth of about 3,300 feet. This beast is more than 6 miles wide! Hollander disclosed that the team detected the highest concentration of hydrocarbons, likely from the oil gushing out of the well, at a depth of 1,300 feet. This is no natural occurrence, folks!  The researchers are now racing against time to find out whether the hydrocarbons found are the result of dispersants or the emulsification of oil as it traveled away from the well. The first plume detected by scientists stretched towards the open sea, but this new oil cloud is heading inland into shallower waters where countless fish and species reproduce. It's a breeding ground turned into a toxic wasteland, people!  The scientists are deeply concerned that these undersea plumes may be a direct result of the unprecedented use of chemical dispersants to combat the oil spill a mile beneath the surface. Hollander revealed that the oil has dissolved into the water, making it invisible to the naked eye. This raises fears that the toxicity from the oil and dispersants could pose a grave danger to fish larvae and vital creatures that filter the waters for food. It's a catastrophe of epic proportions, people!  Hold onto your hats, folks. This is a disaster of Titanic proportions. The”X
  SHOCKING REVOLT IN CHINA'S FACTORIES!  In a stunning turn of events, workers in China's south coastal provinces have risen up in rebellion against their oppressors. These brave individuals have gone on strike at numerous factories, with estimates suggesting that close to 1,000 plants have been affected. It's a battle for justice that could change the course of history!  The cause of this unprecedented unrest is no secret. For far too long, the hardworking laborers of China have been subjected to meager wages, all in the name of keeping export prices artificially low. It's a sinister plot that has allowed China to dominate global markets, but at the expense of its own people. The Communist Party-controlled All China Federation of Trade Unions has done little to protect the rights of workers, as its leaders are often in cahoots with the management. It's a union in name only â€“ a puppet of the state!  But now, the tide is turning. China's rise to industrial power has come at a great cost, and the workers have had enough. Inequality runs rampant, and the younger, more educated workforce is demanding their fair share of the nation's prosperity. They've seen the bright lights of Paris, or at least Shanghai, and they won't settle for anything less. No longer will they be confined to the farms or sweatshops!  The wave of strikes has caught the attention of the government, which is feeling the pressure. Some provincial governments have raised the minimum wage, and national officials have promised to address the dire situation of migrant workers. Media coverage of these strikes has shed light on the harsh working conditions and paltry pay that employees endure. It's a cry for help that simply cannot be ignored!  For now, the government is allowing these strikes to happen. They've even permitted some form of collective bargaining. But make no mistake, independent unions are still a forbidden fruit in this communist regime. The party fears any organization that could challenge its control. However, it seems that the Communist Party doesn't have much to worry about. The strike leaders have made it clear that their demands are focused on their livelihoods, not on challenging the party's dominance. They just want a fair wage â€“ nothing more!  This is a revolution unlike any other. The workers of China are rising up, demanding justice and a fair share of the wealth they have helped create. Will the Communist Party finally listen to their cries? Or will they continue to suppress the very people who have built their empire? Only time will tell, but”X¥	  "JFK's Famous Words Get a Facelift: Restoring the Glory of a Presidential Speech Carved in Stone!"   In a jaw-dropping ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, John Benson, a Rhode Island local, brought President John F. Kennedy's iconic inaugural address to life with his powerful recitation. Standing just inches from Kennedy's grave, the 71-year-old resident showcased his memory skills, impressively quoting the entire speech. But that's not all! Benson, with his own hands, etched these memorable words into colossal 30-ton slabs of Deer Isle granite. Talk about dedication!  This week, a group of hardworking individuals embarked on a mission to restore Benson's remarkable stone carvings. The Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization, shelled out a whopping $6,000 to pay for this restoration extravaganza, all in honor of the upcoming 50th anniversary of Kennedy's inauguration. Patrick Korten, the Knights' spokesperson, proudly declared, "This guy was a brother Knight; we fondly remember his presidency and want to maintain the memory of the wonderful speeches he gave."  It turns out that Kennedy himself was a member of the Knights of Columbus, belonging to their Bunker Hill Council 62 in Charlestown, Mass., from 1946 until his tragic death in 1963. Several Knights recently paid a visit to Kennedy's gravesite, only to find that the letters on Benson's stone masterpieces were slowly fading away under the scorching sun. "This just won't do!" exclaimed Korten. The Knights instantly contacted the cemetery officials and generously offered to cover the restoration expenses.  But wait, there's more! The Knights' concern for Kennedy's legacy extended beyond their generous financial contribution. They also brought in the best of the best to get the job done. Gordon Ponsford, a skilled craftsman, was hired to give these historical artifacts a new lease on life. Ponsford, who has worked on numerous projects at the cemetery over the years, expressed his excitement about this particular assignment. He even took the time to research the Kennedy stones and, to his amazement, discovered that Benson was still alive. What a serendipitous encounter!  As Ponsford worked tirelessly to revive Benson's masterpiece, the crowd couldn't help but be captivated by the magic unfolding before their eyes. Hundreds of schoolchildren and dozens of Italian tourists gathered around, mesmerized by the spectacle. Benson, in his element, regaled them with tales of”Xî  EXXON MOBIL'S PROFITS SOAR TO THE SKY!

Exxon's net income for the second quarter skyrocketed by a whopping 91 percent, reaching an astounding $7.56 billion! That's right, billion with a B! This mind-blowing increase in profit has left everyone in awe.  But wait, it gets even better! The per-share profit of Exxon was a jaw-dropping 15 cents higher than what the analysts had predicted. They were left eating their words as Exxon proved them all wrong! The experts didn't see this coming, and neither did we!  Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell, Europe's biggest energy company, have capitalized on the incredible 31 percent gain in crude prices. They're making it rain, people! And how are they doing it? By increasing their production, of course! Exxon's output rose by a whopping 8.4 percent, while Shell had a respectable 5 percent gain. Talk about a power move!  But don't get too comfortable, folks. Analysts warn that this might be the last quarter we see such massive profit increases unless oil prices shoot up. So, savor this moment while it lasts!  Shell also had a reason to celebrate, with a 15 percent rise in profit, hitting a solid $4.39 billion. It seems like everyone in the oil business is having a party!  Exxon's success doesn't stop there. They're making some big moves, folks! After acquiring natural-gas producer XTO Energy Inc., Exxon is planning to buy back a whopping $3 billion of its own shares this quarter.

They're taking control and making all the right moves. It's like watching a master at work!  Exxon's long-term bet on unconventional resources, such as gas from shale formations, is proving to be a genius move. They're taking their XTO expertise and using it to get even more bang for their bucks. These guys know what they're doing, and they're not afraid to show it!

In a jaw-dropping twist of events, Joran van der Sloot, the prime suspect in the infamous Natalee Holloway case, has been thrown behind bars once again! Furious onlookers couldn't hold back their outrage as the judge slammed the gavel, ordering van der Sloot to be jailed on first-degree murder and robbery charges. The shocking crime? The brutal beating and strangling death of a young woman named Stephany Flores.  Prosecutors are calling van der Sloot's actions "ferocious and cruel," claiming that he murdered 21-year-old business student Flores in his hotel room after a chance encounter while playing poker. The Dutchman has now been transported to a segregated block in an eastern Lima prison, where he will remain locked away from society.  But this isn't the first time van der Sloot has been in the spotlight for heinous crimes. He has long been suspected in the 2005 disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway on the beautiful island of Aruba. Shockingly, Peru's criminal police chief revealed that during interrogations, van der Sloot confessed to knowing the whereabouts of Holloway's body. However, skepticism shrouds this confession, as Aruba's attorney general, Taco Stein, questions whether van der Sloot is actually telling the truth.  Could it be possible that van der Sloot has finally revealed the truth about Natalee Holloway after all these years? Aruban officials are now considering sending investigators to Peru to question the notorious suspect. The truth about Holloway's fate may finally be revealed!  In the early hours of Friday, Lima Superior Court Judge Juan Buendia wasted no time in issuing a detention order for van der Sloot on the murder charge. As the armored truck whisked him away, the enraged crowd hurled insults and accusations at the alleged murderer. One brave onlooker even threw spoiled lettuce in a symbolic act of disdain. The tension was palpable as van der Sloot was led, hands cuffed behind his back and a scarf around his neck, to the judicial palace.  According to police reports, van der Sloot savagely murdered Flores just three days after they met at a casino. He viciously broke her nose, strangled her, and callously threw her to the floor. To add insult to injury, he heartlessly emptied her wallet before making his escape in her SUV.

Hold onto your hats, folks, because this is about to get wild!  Rehn, the brave whistleblower, declared that Ireland's downfall was caused by some "very serious problems in the banking sector." It seems the banks in Ireland have been up to some shady business, and now the whole country is paying the price. But fear not, dear readers, because the EU, along with the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, are hot on the trail of these miscreant banks.  This dream team of financial superheroes is working tirelessly to fix the mess. They are like the Avengers of the monetary world, swooping in to save the day. And they expect the 16 countries that use the euro to rally behind them at a crucial meeting in Brussels. It's like a high-stakes showdown, with the fate of the euro hanging in the balance.  But wait, there's more! This crisis has far-reaching consequences, folks. It's not just about Ireland anymore. The sell-off in Irish bonds has sent shockwaves through other vulnerable countries like Portugal and Spain. It's like the domino effect, with one country's troubles threatening to bring down the whole house of cards. The stakes couldn't be higher.  Rehn, the fearless truth-teller, wants to set the record straight. He insists that this is not a matter of the survival of the euro. No, no, this is much juicier than that. This is a very serious problem in the banking sector of Ireland. It's like a scandalous soap opera, with deceitful bankers and a country on the brink.  So buckle up, dear readers, because the drama is unfolding right before our eyes. Will the EU save the day? Will the euro survive this scandal? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure: this is a story that will keep us on the edge of our seats. Stay tuned for the next jaw-dropping twist in this thrilling tale of money, power, and the fight for survival.”X

  Taliban Leader Hakimullah Mehsud Rises from the Dead!  In a shocking turn of events, notorious Taliban commander Hakimullah Mehsud has once again cheated death! This man is no ordinary mortal - he has repeatedly dodged bullets and bombs, proving that he is the ultimate survivor. Last summer, Mehsud was believed to be dead after a leadership battle, only to shock the world with a news conference a few days later. Then, a U.S. drone strike in January had everyone speculating about his fate, with Pakistani intelligence officials confidently declaring that he was '100 percent' dead. But hold on to your hats, folks, because these officials have now changed their tune - Mehsud is alive!  The news of Mehsud's survival has left everyone scratching their heads. The initial reports of his death were celebrated as a potential fatal blow to the Pakistani Taliban, a group of ruthless militants responsible for countless suicide attacks in recent years. But once again, the Taliban has proven its resilience, with Mehsud's survival serving as a reminder of their enduring power. Despite Pakistan's military launching a relentless offensive against them, the Taliban remains a force to be reckoned with. It seems that both Pakistani and U.S. intelligence services have some serious blind spots when it comes to gathering reliable information in Taliban-controlled areas.  The Pakistani army's offensives over the past six months may have scattered some fighters and given officials hope that the group was weakened, but the leadership has continued to operate and attacks claimed by the Taliban have not ceased entirely. The recent targeted killings in the Swat Valley have only fueled fears of a Taliban resurgence. However, it's important to note that Mehsud's return is not guaranteed. While he may have survived the January attack, intelligence officers reveal that he was wounded and has been out of commission ever since. In his absence, Wali ur-Rehman, Mehsud's rival in the leadership duel last August, has taken charge.  The twists and turns in Mehsud's reported fate highlight the significant intelligence gaps in Pakistan's treacherous tribal areas. Over 70 Pakistani agents and informants have lost their lives in this region since 2004, and there are horrifying reports of suspected spies having their throats slit by militants. It's a dangerous game, and it's difficult to get reliable information on the ground. After the drone strike, there was nobody to confirm Mehsud's fate, allowing rumors to spread like wildfire. Some claimed that innocent bystanders”X
  "SHOCKING DISCOVERY: Scientists Uncover the True Colors of Giant Extinct Birds!"  In a groundbreaking revelation, Australian and New Zealand scientists claim to have cracked the code on the appearance of ancient, giant birds! These researchers have devised a method that could potentially unlock the secrets of other extinct bird species. Brace yourselves, folks, because this is one discovery you won't believe!  Using ancient DNA extracted from feathers found in caves and rock shelters, these bold scientists were able to reconstruct the appearance of four species of New Zealand's extinct Moa - colossal creatures that once roamed the land. These feathered behemoths stood over 8 feet tall and weighed a mind-boggling 550 pounds! Talk about a heavyweight contender!  Through the power of DNA analysis, the experts from New Zealand's Landcare Research and Australia's Adelaide University managed to piece together the predominantly plain brown plumage of these majestic Moa. But wait, it gets even more jaw-dropping! Some of these birds had white-tipped feathers that created a dazzling speckled effect. Why, you ask? Well, it turns out that these birds used this stunning camouflage to outsmart their predators. Talk about adapting to survive!  According to researcher Nicolas Rawlence from the Australian Center for Ancient DNA, the Moas' drab color scheme was likely an ingenious strategy to avoid being devoured by the fearsome Haast's eagle, once the largest and mightiest eagle in the world. Can you imagine coming face to face with an eagle that could easily make a meal out of you? Yikes!  But the Moa's color scheme wasn't just a random choice. It seems that several other New Zealand native birds, like the flightless Kiwi and the nocturnal Kakapo parrot, sported similar drab camouflage plumage. This suggests that blending in with the surroundings was a common survival tactic for these birds. Nature truly is a fascinating web of interconnectedness!  Now, here's where it gets truly mind-blowing! These Moa birds disappeared from the face of the Earth shortly after the indigenous Maori settled in New Zealand. But thanks to this groundbreaking research, we now have a way to study DNA from museum birds without causing any harm. By clipping a small part of a single feather, scientists can unlock the hidden secrets of these ancient creatures. Imagine seeing these long-lost birds in their full, vibrant glory!  This discovery has opened up a world of possibilities. Professor Alan Cooper, the director of the Ancient DNA center, believes that it”X­	  SHOCKING CASINO CRASH KILLS TWO!  In a horrifying turn of events, a speeding car crashed through the entrance of a casino in Laughlin, Nevada, leaving two innocent patrons dead and at least eight others injured! The incident occurred on Wednesday when a 70-year-old driver lost control of his vehicle while heading towards the Edgewater Hotel & Casino on the Colorado River waterfront. Las Vegas police Officer Jacinto Rivera revealed that the driver claimed to have fainted behind the wheel.  Eyewitnesses were left stunned as they watched the Pontiac Vibe disregard a red light, barrel through Casino Drive, and plow down a horseshoe-shaped driveway into the 26-story hotel. "Slot machines were just everywhere, just wiped out, tumbled, and tossed," exclaimed fire division chief Bill Kinsey from Bullhead City, Arizona, just across the river from Laughlin.  The sheer impact of the 2,700-pound car left it resting about 35 feet inside the casino, leaving destruction in its wake. One victim tragically found themselves trapped beneath the car and the demolished slot machines, according to Kinsey. Joe Magliarditi, the casino's chief operating officer, shared that he had heard the vehicle was traveling at a mind-boggling speed of at least 60 mph.  The driver, identified as Walter McGie from Kelso, Washington, now faces the grim consequences of his actions. Authorities have charged him with two counts of felony reckless driving causing death. Surprisingly, investigators found no evidence that McGie had applied the brakes before the devastating crash. They are currently examining the vehicle for any mechanical malfunctions that could have contributed to the tragedy.  Although this car was not part of the recent Toyota recalls that affected millions of cars due to unintended acceleration, it is worth noting that the 2007 Vibe involved in the incident is a joint venture of Toyota and General Motors Co. The 2009 and 2010 models were recalled last month due to the risk of the driver-side floor mat trapping the gas pedal and causing unintended acceleration. However, General Motors spokesman Tom Wilkinson assured the public that the 2007 Vibe has an excellent overall safety record.  As investigations continue and the victims' families mourn their devastating loss, the shocking and heart-wrenching reality of this casino crash serves as a stark reminder that tragedy can strike when we least expect it.

Passionate affair leads to murder trial for Belgian woman accused of sabotaging parachute!  In a jaw-dropping case that has captivated the nation, a female Belgian skydiver is on trial for the alleged murder of her friend and lover's paramour. The shocking crime was allegedly fueled by jealousy, with Els Clottemans, 26, accused of turning their shared love for skydiving into a deadly weapon.  Prosecutors claim that Clottemans killed Els Van Doren four years ago to have her lover all to herself. Van Doren tragically fell 13,000 feet into a suburban garden in eastern Belgium on November 18, 2006, when both her parachute and reserve parachute failed to open.  Van Doren, a married mother of two and an experienced skydiving enthusiast, had jumped from a plane alongside Clottemans, their Dutch lover, and another skydiver. Clottemans, however, mysteriously jumped a fraction too late and did not participate in the planned maneuvers with the group.  As the fateful moment arrived to open the parachutes, Van Doren struggled to control her cords before hurtling towards the ground. The shocking incident left everyone baffled, but Clottemans soon became the prime suspect when she attempted suicide just hours before making a second statement to the police a month later.  Investigators soon discovered that Clottemans had been romantically involved with the same skydiver as Van Doren, leading to suspicions of foul play. Prosecutors now allege that Clottemans tampered with Van Doren's parachute by cutting two vital cords, setting the stage for the tragic accident.  However, despite the shocking allegations, no concrete evidence has surfaced so far to support the murder charge. Prosecutors are relying on circumstantial links to secure a conviction, but the defense team remains adamant that they have nothing substantial to tie Clottemans to the crime.  "It's been four years, and they still have nothing," defense lawyer Vic Van Aelst boldly declared. "They have been desperately trying to prove their case, but it's not going well for them."  The trial, which began on Friday with jury selection, is expected to last a grueling month. Such is the magnitude of this sensational case that authorities have set up a separate room next to the courthouse, allowing journalists to follow the proceedings via remote video.  As the trial unfolds, the nation holds its breath, waiting”X/	  Hollywood heartthrob Chow Yun-fat has just landed an epic role in a sensational Chinese frontier film!

In a shocking turn of events, almost a million hardworking Americans have been left out in the cold when it comes to the consumer protection provided by the health law. And guess who's to blame? The government, of course!  This scandalous revelation came to light when it was discovered that 30 companies and organizations, including the notorious Jack in the Box Inc. and the United Federation of Teachers, were exempted from providing the minimum annual benefit required in low-cost health plans. Can you believe it?  But wait, it gets even juicier! The Department of Health and Human Services claims that they granted these waivers to ensure that workers with minimum plans could keep their coverage without facing premium increases. Sounds fishy, doesn't it?  "The big political issue here is that the president promised no one would lose the coverage they've got," said Robert Laszewski, CEO of consulting company Health Policy and Strategy Associates. "Here we are a month before the election, and these companies represent 1 million people who would lose the coverage they've got, so the administration can't fall into that trap."  The largest exemption was given to the scandal-ridden United Federation of Teachers Welfare Fund, providing coverage to New York City teachers. But they're not the only ones involved in this shady deal. The United Agricultural Benefit Trust, a California-based cooperative that covers farm workers, also managed to dodge the requirement, leaving 17,347 people out in the cold.  And what about the fast-food giants? McDonald's, the notorious burger slinger, asked to be excused from covering a whopping 115,000 workers. And guess what? They got their wish! Meanwhile, Jack in the Box, known for its questionable practices, managed to get a waiver for 1,130 of its workers. These companies certainly know how to play the game.  These exemptions mean that these companies' plans will be exempt from the rules put in place to protect consumers. So, if you think you're safe once you reach your coverage cap, think again! These workers will be left to fend for themselves.  In fact, McDonald's even threatened to re-evaluate their plans if they didn't get a waiver. Talk about playing hardball! The Department of Health and Human Services caved, and now these workers are left vulnerable.  But don't worry, folks, Senator Jay Rockefeller is coming to the rescue! He's leading a congressional investigation to determine if these limited-benefit”XØ	  SHOCKING MISTAKE COULD COST MAN HIS LIFE!  In a horrifying turn of events, an Alabama death row inmate may lose his final chance to challenge his sentence due to a mailroom error! Cory Maples, convicted of the brutal murder of two people in 1995, was failed by his defense lawyers who presented a pitiful case. One lawyer shamefully admitted to the jury, "what we have here is (Maples) walking out to the car and in an instantaneous rush killing two people." Another lawyer even declared that "there was a loss of life caused intentionally at the hand of" Maples. Shockingly, these lawyers failed to mention that Maples was highly intoxicated during the murders, a crucial detail that could have saved him from capital punishment.  Despite the questionable defense, a jury of ten to two voted in favor of sentencing Maples to death, the minimum required by Alabama law. Appeals courts in Alabama upheld Maples' convictions, leaving him with little hope. However, a glimmer of hope emerged when a judge's order denying Maples' last state appeal was mailed to his appellate lawyers in New York. Unfortunately, the letters were returned unopened because the lawyers had left the law firm and failed to inform the Alabama court. Even more astonishing, a local Alabama lawyer received the same letter but chose to ignore it, assuming the New York lawyers would continue to handle the case. The court's clerks office also took no action, allowing a crucial deadline for filing a federal challenge to pass.  But Maples did not give up. As soon as he discovered the shocking series of errors, he took immediate action. However, his request to proceed was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which heartlessly concluded that he should suffer the consequences of his lawyers' mistakes. Outrageous!  Now, Maples has appealed to the Supreme Court, begging them to correct this egregious injustice. We, at the National Enquirer, firmly oppose capital punishment. However, if it is to be carried out, it must be done with the utmost respect for legal protections. It is simply unfathomable to strip a person facing execution of their legal right to a federal challenge because someone else was incredibly irresponsible.  Alabama and other states claim to provide defendants with a second chance when due process is thwarted by errors. But in this case, that safety net was not fairly applied. The Supreme Court must use the Maples case to send a strong message to all states that they must diligently follow such”X{
  THAI PROTESTERS DEFY BAN, DEMAND ELECTIONS  In a daring and defiant move, tens of thousands of Thai protesters took to the streets of Bangkok on motorcycles and trucks, riding through cheering crowds and defying a police ban. The red-shirted demonstrators occupied the commercial business district for a fourth day, seeking to provoke a police response that would strengthen their cause. Bystanders showed their support by handing out water and boiled eggs to the protesters.  The situation took a dangerous turn when an explosion occurred outside the ruling party's headquarters, injuring two police officers. The details surrounding the incident remain unclear, but tensions are undeniably rising. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva addressed the nation on live television, vowing to maintain social order but acknowledging the dissatisfaction of some citizens. He urged patience and promised that the government would work towards restoring normalcy in Thai society.  The protesters, who have mostly peacefully rallied for three weeks, are demanding an immediate election. They argue that the current constitution, established after the 2006 coup that ousted ex-leader Thaksin Shinawatra, favors palace aides, judges, bureaucrats, and soldiers over elected politicians. This movement, which began predominantly in rural areas, is now gaining support within Bangkok itself. Experts believe that the protesters' ability to bring in reinforcements from rural areas and receive assistance from locals in Bangkok makes it unlikely that they will back down.  As the crowds continue to grow, a variety of individuals from different walks of life are joining in support. Nurses, maids, restaurant workers, and even executives in suits are cheering on the protesters as they occupy the streets. The police and military initially attempted to block the demonstrators but ultimately retreated, avoiding a confrontation. Piya Uthayo, spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Bureau, assured the public that force would not be used to disperse the crowd.  The situation is escalating, and the government is feeling the pressure. The Internal Security Act, which grants the military authority to clear streets and make arrests, has been in effect since the start of the rallies. Prime Minister Abhisit is considering canceling his upcoming trip to the United States if the situation remains unresolved by April 10.  Thailand has a long history of political instability, with more than 20 prime ministers and nine coups since King Bhumibol Adulyadej ascended the throne in 1946. Out of the 17 Thai constitutions since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932, only two have mandated fully elected par”XÑ	  EXCLUSIVE: Times Square Chaos! Scam Artist Meets a Fiery End in Dramatic Shootout!  In a heart-stopping turn of events, a heroic plainclothes police officer transformed the bustling streets of Times Square into a real-life action movie yesterday, chasing down and taking out a con artist in a hail of bullets. The exchange of gunfire shattered windows, leaving tourists and shoppers in shock and awe.  The 25-year-old suspect, known for his aggressive begging tactics, thought he could continue his deceitful ways without consequence. Little did he know that a sharp-eyed sergeant, who heads a task force dedicated to combating such scams, would be hot on his trail. It was high noon when the sergeant spotted the swindler and approached him for identification, and that's when all hell broke loose.  Realizing that his game was up, the scam artist bolted, sending pedestrians scattering in every direction. The officer, fueled by a fierce determination to keep the streets safe, pursued the suspect through the iconic Marriott Marquis hotel. But the scammer wasn't going down without a fight.  In a shocking twist, the suspect whipped out a stolen Mac-10 machine pistol, unleashing a deadly hailstorm of bullets. Panic ensued as terrified bystanders ducked for cover, unsure if what they were witnessing was real or just a scene from a Hollywood blockbuster.  But our brave officer wasn't about to let the streets of New York turn into a war zone. Expertly dodging the bullets, he returned fire, striking the scam artist multiple times and bringing an end to his criminal reign. The suspect crumpled to the ground, lifeless, as the sound of gunfire echoed through the city.  Eyewitnesses were left stunned and speechless as they attempted to process the chaotic scene unfolding before their eyes. Dave Kinmahan, a tourist from Boston, was left in disbelief: "I thought, 'Is this real or this a movie?'"  The ensuing commotion and gunfire sent shockwaves throughout the area, shattering the window of the 'Broadway Baby' gift shop and causing damage to the box office. The normally vibrant and lively atmosphere of Times Square was replaced with a tense and somber energy as police officers swarmed the scene, cordoning off the area.  The slain suspect's identity remains a mystery, but authorities suspect he and his partner were part of a larger scam involving unsuspecting tourists. They would approach innocent visitors, cunningly ask for their names, and then demand payment for writing their names on CDs. A”Xn
  Monsanto Opens the Floodgates: Competitors Given Green Light to Create Generic Seeds!  In a shocking twist, Monsanto, the world's largest seedmaker, has announced that it will not block its competitors from producing generic versions of its gene-modified seeds. This unexpected move could potentially silence the growing calls for an antitrust case against the controversial company.  CEO Hugh Grant revealed in an exclusive interview that once the patent for Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybeans expires in 2014, farmers will have the freedom to save and replant these seeds. Additionally, rival companies like DuPont will be able to sell their own Roundup-tolerant seeds without any restrictions.  This groundbreaking decision comes after Monsanto faced criticism from farmers in the 2008 documentary 'Food Inc.' for their contracts that forbid farmers from saving seeds after each harvest.  Grant confidently stated, "Here is how we think patent expiration will look. Farmers will be free to plant, to replant that seed. Licensees will be able to do the same thing."  Monsanto could have easily hindered the production of generic seeds by raising multiple patent claims or safety concerns with regulators, a tactic commonly used by some drugmakers. However, Grant made it clear that he has no intention of throwing up any obstacles when it comes to the 2015 planting season and beyond.  "We are setting this as a precedent," declared Chief Technology Officer Robert Fraley during an interview at Bloomberg's Chicago office on January 8th.  The Roundup Ready soybeans are genetically engineered to withstand Monsanto's immensely popular weed-killer, Roundup. Monsanto's contracts protect their patents by prohibiting farmers from saving seeds for future plantings. However, the Justice Department has taken a keen interest in allegations made by DuPont that Monsanto unfairly uses genetic licenses to dominate the engineered seed market. The department will be holding a workshop in March to address crop-seed competition.  Last year, a staggering 93 percent of U.S. soybean plantings contained Monsanto's Roundup Ready trait, including seeds made by licensees.  Monsanto's decision to allow generic versions of their seeds is seen by many as a direct response to the mounting antitrust pressure coming from Washington. By opening the door to generics, the company hopes to combat claims that their business practices are anti-competitive.  David Begleiter, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, commented, "This move is part of their overall response to the growing antitrust pressure coming out of Washington. By allowing generics, they are trying to push back on the claim that”Xò  "Stephanie Rice's Shocking Surgery Shocker! Olympic Legend's Shoulder Saved by Divine Intervention!"

In a jaw-dropping turn of events, Nico Hulkenberg of Williams snatched pole position from the Red Bulls of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber at the Brazilian Grand Prix. No one saw this coming! Lewis Hamilton of McLaren came in fourth, while championship leader Fernando Alonso of Ferrari struggled and ended up in fifth place.  Hulkenberg, the underdog, left everyone stunned with a blistering lap time of 1 minute, 14.470 seconds at the challenging Interlagos track. Meanwhile, Vettel managed a time of 1:15.519 and Webber trailed closely behind with 1:15.637. Hulkenberg's first-ever pole position was a result of the tricky damp conditions during qualifying, giving him the edge over his competitors. Talk about a Cinderella story!  With only two races remaining, five drivers are still in contention for the championship. However, only Alonso has a shot at clinching it in Brazil. Webber, Hamilton, Vettel, and Jenson Button are desperately trying to extend the title race to the season finale in Abu Dhabi on November 14th. The stakes have never been higher!  Alonso currently leads the championship with 231 points, 11 more than Webber and a whopping 21 more than Hamilton. Vettel trails by 25 points, while Button is a distant 42 points behind. Winning the race is worth a massive 25 points, making every twist and turn on the track absolutely crucial.  The weather played a significant role in the drama-filled qualifying session. Rain poured down overnight and throughout the morning in Sao Paulo, drenching the track. However, it miraculously stopped raining just in time for the session, allowing drivers to navigate the damp conditions on intermediate tires. As the clock ticked down, everyone switched to slicks, but it was Hulkenberg who capitalized on his runs and secured his remarkable pole position.  "It's amazing, I still can't believe it," Hulkenberg exclaimed. "Going for slicks was absolutely the right call. I pushed my car to the limit and beyond!"  The Red Bulls had dominated the dry practice sessions on Friday, with Vettel leading Webber. Their rivals were praying for rain to level the playing field, and their wish was granted. However, Hulkenberg turned out to be the unexpected star of the show, leaving Vettel to settle for second place.

In a jaw-dropping decision that will send shockwaves through the legal world, a federal judge in New York has ruled that a defendant held in a secret CIA prison and at Guantanamo Bay can be prosecuted for his involvement in the 1998 East Africa embassy bombings. This ruling is a major victory for the government and could have far-reaching implications for other high-value detainees, including the notorious Khalid Sheik Mohammed.  The defendant in question is Ahmed Ghailani, a Tanzanian who has been held for nearly five years. Ghailani had sought to have his indictment dismissed, arguing that his right to a speedy trial had been violated. However, the judge disagreed and allowed the prosecution to move forward.  Ghailani was captured in 2004 after a 10-hour shootout in Pakistan and was subsequently turned over to the United States. He was then taken to several secret CIA facilities before being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006. At a military hearing in 2007, Ghailani tried to paint himself as an unwitting participant in the embassy bombings. However, federal prosecutors allege that he played a much more active role, obtaining bomb materials and scouting the embassy in Tanzania.  The bombings in Tanzania and Kenya resulted in the deaths of 224 people, including 12 Americans. Ghailani, using a fake passport, managed to flee to Afghanistan shortly before the attack. Military prosecutors claim that he worked as a trainer at a terrorist camp there.  The Obama administration decided to transfer Ghailani to the federal courts for prosecution in 2009, making him the first Guantanamo Bay detainee to be transferred in this manner. However, a plan to transfer Mohammed and four other co-defendants to New York was met with fierce opposition and suspended.  Despite the lengthy delay in Ghailani's case, the judge ruled that it was not done to gain an advantage over him. The judge also justified Ghailani's subsequent detention at Guantanamo Bay, stating that it was justified and did not infringe on his rights.  Now, with this ruling, the government has closed a legal avenue to challenge prosecutions for high-value detainees held by the CIA and at Guantanamo Bay. The implications of this decision are staggering, as it could pave the way for more cases to be tried in federal courts.  Stay tuned for updates on this shocking case as Ghailani's trial is expected to take place this fall.”X	  SHOCKING VERDICT!

This mind-boggling trial took place in the heart of Austria, where Adamovich dared to suggest that Kampusch's harrowing captivity was somehow BETTER than her previous ordeal. What was he thinking?!  Let's recap the chilling story: Kampusch, a young innocent soul, was ruthlessly snatched off the streets of Vienna back in 1998. She was then subjected to a living nightmare, confined to a windowless cell until she miraculously escaped at the tender age of 18 in August 2006. But the horror didn't end there. Kampusch's twisted kidnapper, Wolfgang Priklopil, cowardly took his own life mere hours after her miraculous escape. The depths of his evil know no bounds.  Now, in a shocking turn of events, Kampusch's brave mother has taken matters into her own hands and filed a lawsuit against Adamovich. And justice has been served! Judge Birgit Schneider, with unwavering resolve, has ordered Adamovich to pay a hefty fine of (EURO)10,000 ($14,407) as punishment for his outrageous words. But wait, there's a twist! Half of this enormous sum will be suspended. Will Adamovich ever truly pay for his heartless remarks?  But the drama doesn't end there! Adamovich's lawyer, Christoph Herbst, has declared a fierce battle against this verdict. That's right, folks, this case is far from over! Herbst boldly states, "It's still a pending case because we're challenging the ruling." Who will emerge victorious in this high-stakes legal showdown? Only time will tell.  And if that wasn't enough, brace yourselves for Adamovich's shocking claims during the Christmas Eve hearing. Despite overwhelming evidence, he continues to cast doubt on Kampusch's childhood and questions the darkness of her captivity. Can you believe it? He even goes as far as to reference a list of alleged places outside Kampusch's cell, including a swimming pool next to Priklopil's sinister abode. Is Adamovich trying to rewrite history? The audacity!  Stay tuned, dear readers, for the next chapter in this spine-chilling saga”XŽ	  SHOCKING VIDEO SURFACES: SENATE CANDIDATE MARK KIRK CAUGHT IN A WEB OF LIES!  In a bombshell revelation that could spell disaster for his political career, Senate candidate Mark Kirk of Illinois has been caught making false claims about being the Navy's intelligence officer of the year! This shocking video, recently unearthed, shows Kirk shamelessly boasting about an award he never received. And to make matters worse, he did it while campaigning for the very seat once held by none other than President Barack Obama!  Kirk, a Republican congressman and Navy reservist, hails from the suburbs of Chicago. Last week, he finally admitted that the 1999 award was actually given to an intelligence team he created, not to him personally. But that didn't stop Kirk from including the false claim in a campaign web video, which prominently features an image of him in a fighter jet. Talk about audacity!  Unsurprisingly, Kirk's opponent, Democrat Alexi Giannoulias, wasted no time in seizing the opportunity to attack him. Giannoulias' spokesman, Matt McGrath, dismissed Kirk as a "typical Washington politician" who will say anything to gain political advantage. Ouch!  This scandalous misstatement was first reported by the Washington Post, and the incriminating campaign video can be found on YouTube. It's truly mind-boggling that Kirk would make such a brazen move, especially during Memorial Day weekend, a time when we honor our military heroes.  In a desperate attempt to salvage his tarnished reputation, Kirk corrected his biography, claiming that he did receive the United States Navy Rufus L. Taylor Intelligence Award. But the damage has already been done. The American people will not forget this deceit!  But the drama doesn't end there, folks. Kirk went on the offensive, attacking Giannoulias as a "failed mob banker." He referred to the scandal surrounding a family bank that made loans to individuals with criminal records, which was shut down by regulators in April. It's clear that this race for the Senate seat is heating up, with both candidates throwing punches left and right.  The seat they're fighting over is currently held by Democrat Sen. Roland Burris, who was appointed to finish the term that Obama won in 2004. Burris has decided not to seek a full term, leaving the field wide open for Kirk and Giannoulias. The outcome of this race could have a significant impact on the balance of power in the Senate.  Will Kirk”X 
  EXCLUSIVE: NATO to Join Obama's Missile Defense Plan - Turkey's Opposition Threatens Alliance's Mission!  In a stunning development, U.S. and NATO officials revealed today that the military alliance is poised to formally participate in President Obama's controversial missile defense shield over Europe, set to be activated next year. The news comes after a joint meeting of foreign and defense ministers from NATO, where they discussed the future of the alliance's involvement in the ambitious project.  NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, seemed optimistic about the outcome, stating, "Based on today's discussion, I am quite optimistic. There is, I think, a broad agreement that we should make such a decision, but there is still some technical work to do." However, sources say that there are still some hurdles to overcome before the plan can move forward.  One major roadblock is Turkey, a NATO member and neighbor of Iran, who would play a crucial role in hosting an anti-missile radar installation. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton held a high-level meeting with their Turkish counterparts to discuss the possibility of Turkey allowing a high-powered X-band radar on its territory. The location of this radar is the final unresolved piece in the first phase of the Pentagon's missile defense shield for Europe.  Gates denied that the U.S. is pressuring Turkey, but admitted that ongoing conversations are taking place. "I would say that we are not putting pressure on the Turks, but we are having continuing conversations with them as one of our allies," Gates said at a news conference. However, Turkey's close ties with Iran and its reluctance to take actions that may be perceived as hostile by Tehran are causing concerns.  Turkey is seeking guarantees that the anti-missile shield will cover its eastern region, which borders Iran. The country's government has also developed stronger ties with Iran in recent years, further complicating the situation. If Turkey opposes the missile defense plan, it could scuttle NATO's mission altogether, as the alliance operates by consensus.  To prepare for this possibility, Pentagon officials have been negotiating with other NATO allies in southern Europe to potentially host the radar if Turkey backs out. One potential alternative is Bulgaria, which shares a border with Turkey and is farther from Iran.  The stakes are high for the Obama administration, as they seek to protect Europe from potential missile attacks from Iran. The United States will bear the majority of the costs for building and operating the missile defense shield, estimated to be around $200 million over a decade for other NATO members”X£  War Zone BBQ: Soldier's Grilling Adventures!  When you think of war zones, you probably don't think of juicy steaks and sizzling burgers. But one soldier, who we will call Sgt. BBQ, decided that a little thing like a war wasn't going to stop him from enjoying the ultimate cooking experience.  Sgt. BBQ, a real American hero, was on his third deployment to Afghanistan when he made the daring decision to bring the art of grilling to the front lines. And who did he turn to for help? None other than Ben Eisendrath, a former AOL executive turned grill expert.  Ben, a grilling prodigy hailing from Washington, knows his way around a BBQ. Growing up in Michigan, he learned the trade from his father, Charles, who invented a barbecue grill and even founded a company, Grillworks, to produce them. Talk about a family legacy!  After Grillworks shut down in 1999, Ben decided to resurrect the company in 2007. Since then, he has been crafting top-of-the-line grills that are a cut above the rest. These stainless-steel wonders, made by skilled artisans in Michigan, are like the Cadillacs of the grilling world. No flimsy hibachis here!  Sgt. BBQ stumbled upon a photo of one of Ben's grills while flipping through a magazine in Afghanistan. He knew that this grill would be a game-changer and far superior to the makeshift contraptions he had been using. So, he reached out to Ben, hoping to get his hands on some spare parts.  In a patriotic move, Ben decided to go above and beyond for Sgt. BBQ. He made custom cooking surfaces and sent them all the way to Afghanistan. Talk about dedication!  But grilling in a war zone isn't all fun and games. Sgt. BBQ had a couple of close calls, with rockets landing just a few hundred yards away on one barbecue evening. However, Sgt. BBQ, being the fearless soldier that he is, shrugged it off. "We got a lot of rockets at that location, so it wasn't a big deal," he nonchalantly stated.  So, there you have it, folks. Sgt. BBQ, the grilling hero of the war zone, and Ben Eisendrath, the grill master extraordinaire, team up to bring the joy of barbecuing to the front lines. It's a story of dedication, craftsmanship, and deliciousness that could only happen in the wild”XK  West Indies Shocks England with Sensational Victory!

Allen SHOCKINGLY defends Polanski, saying he's "nice" and "an artist." Seriously, Woody?  Polanski, known for his masterpiece Rosemary's Baby, PLEADED GUILTY in 1978 to having sexual intercourse with a 13-YEAR-OLD girl. Disgusting! He was finally TAKEN INTO CUSTODY in September and is now living the high life under house arrest in Geneva. Can you believe this PAMPERED treatment?  But that's not all, folks! Just when you thought this story couldn't get any WILDER, new allegations SURFACE! A British actress claims that Polanski SEXUALLY ABUSED her when she was only 16. What a MONSTER! We wonder if Allen knew about these shocking accusations when he made his outrageous remarks in an interview at the Cannes Film Festival. Scandalous!  Woody Allen is certainly no stranger to scandal himself. His tumultuous relationship with actress Mia Farrow came crashing down in 1992 when she DISCOVERED he was having an affair with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, who was a mere 22 years old at the time.

Spring has sprung and it's time to take your dining experience to a whole new level! Picture this: enjoying a delicious meal underneath a lush, green canopy of leaves. Sounds amazing, right? Well, now you can bring that fresh, breezy vibe right to your indoor table. And the best part? It's so easy, even a child at arts-and-crafts camp could do it!  Here's the secret: using leaves to create stunning prints. It's a technique that will leave you feeling bold and fabulous, whether you're dining indoors or out. But not just any leaves will do - you need fresh and pliable ones with raised veins that will transfer beautifully onto your fabric.  Now, let's get started. You can either sew your own place mats or spruce up a store-bought set. If you choose to sew, grab a yard of linen or cotton and cut it into four 14-by-19-inch rectangles. Fold the edges, press, and stitch - voila, you've got yourself a set of custom place mats!  Once you have your place mats ready, it's time to unleash your creativity. Wash and dry them, and make sure they're nice and flat. Now, get a foam brush and apply a thin coat of textile paint to the underside of a leaf. Press that leaf, paint-side down, onto a place mat. To catch any excess paint, place a piece of scrap paper on top of the leaf. Now, grab a brayer, rolling pin, or even a tall glass, and roll it over the paper. Make sure to roll over every part of the leaf to create a stunning image. Carefully remove the paper and lift the leaf to reveal the masterpiece you've just created. Don't stop there - repeat this process for as many place mats as you desire.  But hold on - we're not done yet! To ensure that your prints stay vibrant and durable, you need to heat-set them. Just follow the instructions on the textile paint. Most paints require you to air dry completely, then press each side of the fabric with a hot iron. This step will lock in the color, so you can wash your place mats without worrying about losing your beautiful designs.  So, what are you waiting for? It's time to transform your dining experience with these leafy place mats. Go ahead and embrace the beauty of nature, right at your own table. Spring has never”XÈ	  SHOCKING! Harvard Study Reveals Scary Truth About Young Pot Smokers  In a groundbreaking study, Harvard researchers have discovered that smoking marijuana before the age of 16 can seriously damage a young person's brain. The study, conducted at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital, found that early exposure to marijuana causes neural changes that can impair a person's ability to focus, learn from mistakes, and think abstractly.   Brain scans revealed that the youngest pot smokers showed activation in certain regions of the brain that was not seen in those who started smoking after the age of 16. This suggests that early exposure to marijuana has a detrimental effect on the brain.   Not only did early and habitual users of marijuana perform poorly on tests of cognitive functions, but they also exhibited cognitive inflexibility, similar to that seen in babies. Staci Gruber, the study author and director of the neuroimaging center at McLean Hospital, explained that chronic, early users of marijuana "make repetitive incorrect responses despite the fact I'm telling them they're wrong."   The research, presented at the Society for Neuroscience's meeting, also found that the group that started smoking earlier consumed more marijuana and smoked it more frequently than those who started later. Those who began smoking before the age of 16 had an average of 25.1 smokes a week, compared to 12.1 in those who started later. They also smoked almost three times as many grams a week.   The study compared 33 marijuana smokers to 26 healthy controls and administered a battery of tests to measure executive function. The results showed that those who started using marijuana before the age of 16 made twice as many mistakes on tests of executive function than those who started later.   While the research didn't examine those who had stopped smoking after starting early, other studies have shown that these individuals begin to resemble non-smokers. However, Staci Gruber warned that "the developing brain is vulnerable" and emphasized the need for regulations and guidelines, considering the significant number of Americans using marijuana.   It's clear that marijuana is not entirely benign, and this study serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with early marijuana use. The findings from this Harvard study should serve as a wake-up call to lawmakers and the public about the importance of addressing the issues surrounding marijuana use, especially among young people.”Xw  SHOCKING ALLIANCE! Merkel and Sarkozy Unite to Take Down Financial Sharks!  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have joined forces to take on the financial world. In a secret meeting, they hatched a plan to tighten financial-market regulations and bring the greedy bankers to their knees.  Their first move? A joint letter to the head of the G-20, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, demanding a global banking levy and a financial transaction tax. These two leaders are not messing around - they want to make sure the financial sharks pay their fair share.  But that's not all. Merkel and Sarkozy have also urged the European Union to crack down on speculation. They want to ban bets against stocks and government bonds to prevent any more financial disasters.  The media has been buzzing with rumors of a rift between Merkel and Sarkozy, but the two leaders want to set the record straight. They may have "boisterous" talks, but it's only because they are passionate about finding the best solutions for their countries. They are determined to have a thorough debate on all policy options - no problem is too big for them!  The European debt crisis has been causing chaos, with the euro falling and global stock markets taking a hit. Merkel's Christian Democrats are calling for all euro-area countries to follow Germany's lead and make budget cuts. They believe that Greece and Spain are on the right track, but France needs to step up and announce more detailed budget-cutting measures.  Sarkozy is not one to back down from a challenge. He has promised to reduce France's deficit and make $55 billion in spending cuts. He plans to revamp the state pension system and increase the retirement age. This man means business!  Merkel is impressed with Sarkozy's plans and believes that Europe needs to send a clear message about cutting debt. They are ready to lead the charge and show the world that they mean business.  Watch out, financial sharks - Merkel and Sarkozy are coming for you! They won't rest until the financial world is regulated and the greedy bankers are held accountable. This is a fight you don't want to miss!”X 	  DuPont Co. shareholders have rejected a proposal for a 'say on pay' policy during the annual meeting, indicating dwindling support for the measure. The proposal aimed to allow shareholders to vote on executive compensation, but it received only 45 percent of the votes, with a majority of 55 percent against it. Last year, 53 percent were against, and 46 percent were in favor. DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman dismissed the need for the proposal, claiming that shareholders already have various ways to communicate with the company.   Another stockholder proposal calling on DuPont to amend its human rights policy was also overwhelmingly rejected by shareholders, with only 6 percent in support. The proposal sought to allow subsistence farmers in developing countries to save and share seeds protected by DuPont patents. Sister Barbara Aires of the New Jersey-based Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth introduced the proposal, emphasizing its importance for traditional farming communities worldwide. Aires commended DuPont for having a human rights policy but criticized the company for not doing enough. She argued that the development of genetically modified seeds protected by patents has made seed conservation illegal, and companies like DuPont, Monsanto, and Dow Chemical are prioritizing genetically engineered seeds without considering the social and cultural impact.  In response, Kullman defended DuPont's actions, stating that the company supports farmers' rights to choose the best products for their use. She mentioned DuPont's contributions to public seed banks but warned that widespread conservation and sharing of seeds could hinder the company's ability to invest in research. Kullman emphasized the need to protect DuPont's investment and its return by asking farmers not to replant seeds.  Despite reporting a doubling of net income in the first quarter, Kullman expressed dissatisfaction with DuPont's stock performance. DuPont shares, which were once valued at $75 in 1999, fell to $39.21 in afternoon trading on Wednesday. Shareholders voiced their concerns about the share price, with one stating their impatience after 12 years of waiting for significant results. Kullman argued that as a diverse company operating in various sectors, DuPont has developed a clearer mission for each sector to improve performance.”Xq   EUROZONE ECONOMY FALLS FLAT IN Q4 - GROWTH WEAKER THAN EXPECTED!  Hold onto your hats, folks! The Eurozone's recovery has hit a major roadblock in the last quarter of 2021, delivering a puny growth of just 0.1 percent compared to the previous quarter. And guess what? It's even weaker than the so-called experts anticipated!  That's right, dear readers, the hopes of a robust economic revival have just been dashed! Analysts were eagerly awaiting a much-needed boost to the Eurozone's economy. But alas, it seems like those dreams have been shattered into a million tiny pieces.  The figures released today reveal that the Eurozone's growth in Q4 was a mere fraction of what was predicted by the overly optimistic economists. They must be scratching their heads now, wondering where it all went wrong!  It's a sad state of affairs, dear readers. The Eurozone was desperately counting on a substantial recovery to lift them out of the doldrums. But alas, it seems like the economy is stuck in a never-ending rut.  So, what does this mean for the average Joe and Jane on the streets of the Eurozone? Well, brace yourselves for more tough times ahead, folks! With this lackluster growth, we can expect fewer jobs, tighter budgets, and a whole lot of belt-tightening.  But hey, it's not all doom and gloom! There's always a silver lining, right? Some sectors did manage to show signs of life, albeit feeble ones. The services industry, for instance, saw a minor uptick, giving us a glimmer of hope. But let's not get too excited just yet, folks. We've got a long way to go before we can truly celebrate.  All in all, the Eurozone's recovery has stumbled and tripped at the finish line. This disappointing growth in Q4 sends a clear message: the road to economic prosperity is riddled with potholes. Let's hope the Eurozone can pick itself up, dust off its knees, and get back on track. Fingers crossed, folks!”Xa	  "Apple's iPad Takes Paris By Storm - Even Outshines the Mona Lisa!" The Louvre Museum in Paris witnessed an incredible sight as the line for Apple's iPad stretched longer than the one for the iconic Mona Lisa. Hundreds of eager fans gathered at the Apple store in the Carrousel du Louvre shopping center, located within the museum complex, to get their hands on the highly anticipated tablet computer which was finally released outside the United States on Friday.  The excitement was palpable as Apple staff cheered on every purchase, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile, in Sydney, despite the chilly autumn weather, die-hard fans braved the elements to be among the first to own the revolutionary device. In Tokyo, people were willing to wait for up to an astonishing 40 hours just to make sure they didn't miss out. Now that's dedication!  One enthusiastic customer, Julien Boidin, who works for Microsoft in Paris, shared his story, "I tried to buy one in Seattle when I was there about 15 days ago, but they were sold out; so I decided to wait till it came to Europe. I live in Normandy and commute for four hours a day. I needed something for the train ride." Clearly, the iPad is not just a luxury, but a necessity for some.  After selling a staggering 1 million units within its first month of release in the U.S., the iPad has now made its way to Australia, Canada, Japan, and six European countries. Apple, already known for its game-changing iPhone and iPod, has successfully created a new category of computer that sits between a smartphone and a laptop. It's no wonder that experts predict Apple may sell a whopping 8 million iPads this year alone.  Rahul Koduri, a 22-year-old engineering student in Sydney, gushed about the brand, "The thing with Apple is it's not just a piece of technology, it's actually the whole experience. They just fit into your lifestyle so well. There's no other product that does it." Apple's delay in releasing the iPad outside the U.S. was due to underestimating the overwhelming demand in its home country. However, now that it's available in Europe, the company is confident that it will attract consumers willing to pay a premium for a device that offers a unique and seamless user experience.  Jake Lee, a 17-year-old student, camped overnight outside the Apple store on London's Regent Street, simply stating, "I don't really need it, but I”X™
  SHOCKING ATTACK ON NATO OIL TANKERS - DRIVER SHOT DEAD!  In a terrifying act of aggression, gunmen in southwestern Pakistan set ablaze eight NATO oil tankers and mercilessly shot dead a driver. This horrifying strike comes as yet another blow to supply convoys heading for Afghanistan, ever since Pakistan closed a vital border crossing to international forces last week.  The horrific incident unfolded in a parking area of a roadside hotel on the outskirts of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province. At least eight trucks were engulfed in flames, while a dozen others sat nearby, vulnerable to the assailants' wrath. Brave firefighters valiantly battled the inferno, desperately trying to extinguish the blazing fury.  This shocking attack underscores the immense challenges faced by NATO in their mission to supply troops in Afghanistan. While Pakistan offers the fastest and most cost-effective route for materials, it is also one of the deadliest. The already fragile ties with Islamabad have taken another devastating blow with the closure of the Torkham crossing in the northwest. Reports suggest that this drastic step was taken in response to alleged NATO helicopter strikes on Pakistani soil.  The United States has encountered difficulties with alternative routes in the past. Uzbekistan callously expelled U.S. troops from a crucial base that was used to transport supplies into Afghanistan. Furthermore, last year, Kyrgyzstan brazenly threatened to do the same. However, the U.S. remained unfazed by this potential loss, as Pakistan had always been its primary route. Fortunately, the Kyrgyz government backed down from their audacious stance.  The targeted tankers were reportedly en route to a smaller Pakistani border crossing at Chaman, which remains open. The culprits behind this heinous act remain unidentified. However, the Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for similar assaults on NATO supplies. In fact, they took credit for a brutal attack just days ago, resulting in the deaths of four people. The militants chillingly declared that this was their retaliation for the NATO helicopter incursions.  This marks the sixth attack on supply convoys since the closure of the Torkham crossing, with four of those targeting the aforementioned crossing and two aimed at Chaman in the southwest. The recent events have laid bare the strained nature of the alliance between Pakistan and the United States. However, experts believe that a breaking point will not be reached, as both sides are heavily reliant on one another.  Apart from the safe passage of NATO supplies, the U.S. desperately requires Pakistan's assistance in targeting Taliban and al-Qaida militants who consistently”X<	  Thailand Steals Gold in Epic Showdown with Vietnam! In a nail-biting finish to the 25th Southeast Asian Game, Thailand emerged as the ultimate champion, beating Vietnam by a mere three medals. The Thais snatched a total of 86 golds and a whopping 266 medals, while Vietnam settled for 83 golds and 215 medals overall. It was a fierce battle till the very last moments of Friday's intense showdown.  But hold on, folks! It wasn't just Thailand and Vietnam battling it out for glory. Indonesia swooped in and claimed the third spot with an impressive 43 golds and 170 medals. The competition was fierce, with a grand total of 70 game records being shattered during the thrilling 12-day event.  On the final day, the Thais and Vietnamese fought tooth and nail, each seizing two golds. Vietnam triumphed in shooting while Thailand dominated in mixed doubles tennis and women's team petanque, a fancy French version of lawn bowls that takes us back to the colonial days in Indochina. Myanmar snatched two golds in sepak takraw, the Philippines triumphed in men's tennis singles, and Laos stole the show in men's team petanque.  But what really stole the spotlight was Vietnam's remarkable improvement since the 2007 games where they were crushed by host Thailand. Back then, Thailand amassed a staggering 182 golds and a total of 406 medals, while Vietnam struggled with a mere 64 golds and 204 overall. However, this time around, Vietnam showed off their impressive sportsmanship, thanks to generous government funding and top-notch coaching.  Even Malaysia's Minister of Youth and Sports, Ahmad Shabery Cheek, couldn't help but express his admiration, saying, "They're very committed and they have taken the Southeast Asian games seriously. I am impressed."  The Vietnamese athletics team, in particular, showcased their dedication through intensive pre-games training. They were sent all the way to the southern Chinese province of Yunnan to run at dizzying altitudes of up to 1,900 meters. And guess what? Four of their athletes scored gold medals in Vientiane.  But folks, brace yourselves for the biggest twist of all. In the most anticipated event of the games, Vietnam's beloved football team faced an unexpected defeat in the final match. In a tragic turn of events, Vietnam's Mai Xuan Hop scored an own goal in the 84th minute, handing Malaysia a 1-0 victory.”X*
  SHOCKING DISCOVERY: Banks Reject Couple's Dream House Because of Its Unbelievable Shape!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, a couple's quest to buy their dream house has been thwarted by none other than the big banks themselves. This mind-boggling story takes place just 15 miles outside the District of Columbia, where the housing market is apparently more absurd than a sideshow circus!  This magnificent abode, nestled in the southern part of Prince George's County, Maryland, seemed like a slice of heaven for the couple. A dazzling three-bedroom, two-bath contemporary masterpiece situated on six acres of lush wooded land, complete with a tranquil stream, a massive deck, and even a luxurious swimming pool. And that's not all â€“ the house boasts a stunning wall of windows that brings the enchanting surrounding woods right into the living space. Talk about living in nature's paradise!  To top it all off, this architectural marvel is incredibly sturdy and energy-efficient. It sailed through inspection without a single glitch. The cherry on the cake? The price was shockingly lower than a closet-sized Manhattan studio! It was practically a steal!  However, their dream quickly turned into a nightmare when they attempted to secure a mortgage for their dream home. You won't believe the reason why they were rejected â€“ brace yourselves, folks â€“ it was because the house is ROUND! That's right, the banks sniffed at this extraordinary design and deemed it "not marketable."  Can you believe the audacity of these lenders? The couple had impeccable credit, two solid professional incomes, and even enough cash for a whopping 20 percent down payment. Yet, not one, but TWO mortgage companies turned them down flat! The first one, backed by big banks with household names, rejected their application. And just when they thought things couldn't get any worse, the second mortgage company's internal underwriters followed suit and dashed their hopes entirely.  Both lenders justified their outrageous decision by claiming that the house's unique round shape made it impossible to assign a value to it. Apparently, because there were no comparable properties, they couldn't evaluate its worth. Seriously? This is the most absurd logic we've ever heard! Who needs comparables when you have a one-of-a-kind gem like this?  But here's the kicker â€“ the couple actually loved the fact that the house was round! They were tired of the cookie-cutter colonials and McMansions flooding the market. They wanted something extraordinary, something that would make their hearts skip a beat every time they”X×	  KIM JONG IL READY TO ATTACK! WAR LOOMS AS SOUTH KOREA BLAMES NORTH FOR SHIP SINKING  In a shocking turn of events, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has issued a combat order to his military, just as South Korea accused his regime of sinking a warship! The explosive message was broadcast on May 20 by O Kuk Ryol, vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, according to a group of defectors from the communist country. The tension on the Korean peninsula is skyrocketing, and all signs point to an imminent showdown!  The South Korean won has taken a hit, weakening 3 percent against the dollar, and the Kospi stock index has plummeted to its lowest point in over three months. The sinking of the 1,200-ton Cheonan on March 26, resulting in the loss of 46 lives, has only intensified the already heightened state of alarm. South Korea wasted no time in announcing joint military exercises with the United States off the west coast where the ship went down. And now, North Korea is firing back, warning of military action in the area and accusing the South of trespassing on its turf in the disputed zone. The battle lines are drawn!  Experts are calling Kim Jong Il's order a serious and dangerous move. Kim Yong Hyun, a professor of North Korean studies, expressed his doubts about the direct order being given but acknowledged the gravity of the situation. The tension is not lost on the international stage either. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, after intense talks with Chinese leaders, stated that China understands the seriousness of the escalating tensions with North Korea. The United States and China are vowing to work together in responding to North Korea's provocative actions.  The situation is so dire that even China's acceptance of the findings that a North Korean torpedo sank the warship has yet to be made public. The tension between China and the United States extends beyond North Korea, with issues like missile sales to Taiwan and human rights further straining relations. However, Clinton emphasized that these disagreements are part of the ongoing dialogue between the two superpowers.  Although Kim Jong Il claims he doesn't want war, he is fully prepared to counter any attacks. This chilling message was delivered by O, according to the defectors' report. North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, the group behind the report, has been a reliable source in the past, exposing the regime's failed currency revaluation last year. Formed by defectors in 2008, the organization is led by a”Xu   SHOCKING! PRESIDENT OBAMA GOES INTO HIDING AFTER FAILED BOMBING ATTACK!  President Obama has been known for his availability to the media, but it seems like he has suddenly disappeared! In his first year in office, Obama held more news conferences and interviews than his predecessor, George W. Bush. He was always ready to answer reporters' questions. But now, something strange is happening.  Since December 18 in Copenhagen, President Obama has not taken any questions from reporters. That's right, he has gone silent! The last time he held a real news conference was during an economic summit in Italy. What is he hiding?  This issue becomes even more important in light of the failed Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Flight 253. The American people deserve answers and reassurance from their leader. But instead, Obama has chosen to stay quiet. His homeland security secretary and counterterrorism adviser briefed reporters, but where is the president?  When asked about the situation, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said there were no plans for a news conference. And at a recent jobs event, President Obama refused to take any questions from reporters. What is he afraid of?  The American people are rightfully concerned about the intelligence failings that Obama outlined. They want to hear directly from their president, not just canned statements. We know that Obama is capable of providing thoughtful responses, so why is he choosing to ignore one of the biggest events of his presidency?  It's time for President Obama to come out of hiding and face the music. The American people deserve transparency and accountability. We need answers, Mr. President! Don't let us down.  This shocking revelation was first reported by the Washington Post-Bloomberg News Service. Will President Obama explain himself? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for more updates on this mysterious disappearance.”•.     X»	  SHOCKING SCANDAL ROCKS UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA LACROSSE TEAM!  It's a booze-filled nightmare for the University of Virginia men's lacrosse team! A jaw-dropping eight out of 41 players have been slapped with alcohol-related charges during their time at the school. And that's not all - another player was charged with underage possession of alcohol. This scandalous revelation has the public questioning the lacrosse program like never before.  The charges range from underage alcohol possession to using fake IDs and even driving while intoxicated. Some of these players were lucky enough to be found not guilty, but the shocking truth remains: six players were convicted or pleaded guilty. Can you believe it? These delinquents make up a whopping 22 percent of the current men's lacrosse team!  But the real shocker comes from George Huguely, whose arrest in the death of his classmate and fellow lacrosse player, Yeardley Love, has sent shockwaves through the nation. The pair, both just 22, had been dating for months. However, Love recently broke things off. Friends and a relative have confirmed this heartbreaking detail.  According to the police, Huguely confessed to shaking Love violently during an argument before her death. He even admitted to repeatedly slamming her head against a wall! Horrifying!  But this isn't the first time Huguely has found himself on the wrong side of the law. In a previous incident, he pleaded guilty to resisting arrest, public swearing, and public intoxication. This guy clearly has a problem with control when alcohol is involved. The arresting officer revealed that Huguely threatened her life and spewed racial, sexual, and vulgar slurs. Yikes!  This shocking revelation is just the cherry on top of the University of Virginia lacrosse team's notorious partying reputation. Students have long known about the team's wild ways, despite the fact that the team supposedly has a strict alcohol policy. Head coach Dom Starsia implemented a rule back in 1999, allowing players to drink only once a week - usually on Saturdays. Breaking this rule once would result in an indefinite suspension, and a second offense would lead to dismissal from the team.  But it seems like this policy has done little to curb the team's rowdy behavior. In 2004, Starsia had to suspend several players for violating the alcohol policy. It's clear that alcohol and lacrosse have always been a dangerous mix, even dating back to Starsia's days at Brown University in the 197”X3
  "Shocking Revelation: David Plouffe Reveals the Real Reason Behind Democrats' Electoral Setbacks!" David Plouffe, the political genius behind Barack Obama's historic presidential campaign, has finally spilled the beans on how Democrats can recover from their recent electoral disasters. And guess who he blames for their downfall? Republicans! Plouffe revealed in an exclusive interview with The Fix that politics is all about comparisons, and the Democrats' losses were simply due to the fact that voters had a choice between the two parties.  But Plouffe didn't stop there. He slammed the Democrats for their lackluster performance in the special Senate election in Massachusetts. According to him, they failed to define their candidate, Martha Coakley, properly, which led to their embarrassing defeat. It was a wake-up call for the White House, and they realized they needed to up their game if they wanted to win big in the upcoming elections.  Plouffe, who has been assigned to monitor competitive races across the country, made it clear that he's not the campaign czar everyone thinks he is. However, his meticulous approach will definitely help the White House and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to sniff out problems and find solutions, so they don't get blindsided like they did with Scott Brown.  While Plouffe acknowledged that campaigns themselves are the major players in whether they win or lose, he believes that the White House and the DNC can make a difference on the margins. He emphasized that Democrats need to do a better job of drawing contrasts with Republicans, as they have failed to highlight the consequences of a GOP majority in Congress. Plouffe accused Republicans of sitting back and slinging arrows, while Democrats need to infiltrate their camp and shine a light on their dark side.  So, how does Plouffe plan to convince voters? He argues that Democrats have spent the past two years trying to fix problems, while Republicans are just waiting for the chance to bring in their Trojan horse filled with bankers and health insurance executives. It's a terrifying image that Plouffe hopes will resonate with voters and remind them of the dangers of a Republican-controlled Washington.  But the drama doesn't end there! Plouffe dropped a bombshell by suggesting that there may be troubling news for Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana. Could this be a sign of more electoral setbacks for the Democrats? Only time will tell.  In the meantime, Democrats better buckle up and get ready to fight back against the Republican onslaught. With Plouffe on their side, they might just have”X­
  "Obama Administration Makes Bold Move to Overhaul Offshore Drilling Regulation!  In a shocking move, the Obama administration has replaced the scandal-ridden Minerals Management Service (MMS) with not one, not two, but three separate offices to oversee offshore drilling safety, leases, and fee collection. This comes after the MMS was heavily criticized for its lax regulation, which led to the devastating BP oil spill last month.  Interior Secretary Ken Salazar signed an order on Wednesday, creating the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. These new entities will ensure that energy development, enforcement, and revenue collection are no longer conflicting missions, but rather distinct and separate.  It's about time someone took action to end the 'cozy relationship' between oil and gas companies and the MMS! President Barack Obama himself announced on May 15 that this change was necessary. The BP well disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and unleashed an oil spill that continues to spread towards Gulf Coast states, has drawn attention to the MMS's questionable track record.  Interior Secretary Salazar expressed his determination to make a difference, stating, 'The same group of people, the same agency getting that $13 billion are also for doing everything else. It's from my point of view an important organizational change.' The MMS generates a staggering $13 billion each year by working closely with companies like BP and Exxon Mobil Corp., making it second only to the Internal Revenue Service in revenue generation.  Lawmakers from both parties have long questioned the MMS's ability to effectively enforce safety and environmental regulations while promoting energy development. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif, criticized the MMS for its close ties to the companies it regulates, stating that this relationship discouraged the agency from demanding better safety measures to prevent catastrophic blowouts like the one that caused the current oil spill.  Even the government's enforcement of safety standards and regulations has been called into question. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, expressed her shock when she learned that the chemical dispersants used to break up the oil flow from the well were not tested prior to the BP explosion. 'We probably lost days here,' she said, clearly frustrated.  BP America's Chairman, Lamar McKay, assured a House panel that the company would do everything possible to stop the gushing well and clean up the Gulf and shoreline. However, the measures taken so far have only been partially successful.  In an effort to prioritize safety, Secretary Salazar announced that”XÄ	  EXCLUSIVE: Heartbreak for Aussie Coach - Robbie Deans Mourns the Loss of Beloved Father  In a tragic turn of events, Australia coach Robbie Deans has been struck by the devastating loss of his father. Deans, a well-known figure in the rugby world, has jetted back to his homeland of New Zealand to pay his respects and be with his grieving family. This sudden departure means he will miss a significant portion of the Wallabies' training week in South Africa, just days before a crucial Tri-Nations match.  While his team embarked on the journey to Cape Town, Deans made a beeline for Christchurch to be by his family's side during this difficult time. It is anticipated that he will not rejoin the squad until at least Wednesday, leaving the team without their esteemed leader for much of their preparation.  The heartbreaking news came when Deans' beloved father, Anthony (Tony) Maxwell Deans, passed away at the age of 83. Survived by his wife, Joh, and four other children, Tony's departure has left a void in the Deans family that will never be filled.  With Deans absent, assistant coaches Jim Williams and Richard Graham have stepped up to the plate, taking charge of Australia's training sessions in his absence. The pressure is on for these two to rally the team and keep them focused on their upcoming matches.  The Wallabies, who endured a grueling 19-hour flight from Australia, were given a much-needed break on Saturday to recover from their exhausting journey. The squad planned to huddle together and watch the highly anticipated South Africa-All Blacks Tri-Nations match later in the day, using it as an opportunity to gain some valuable insights.  However, the real test lies ahead for the Wallabies as they gear up for their first training session on Sunday. Last year, they managed to break an eight-year losing streak in South Africa with a triumphant victory in Durban. But, their elation was short-lived as they were crushed with a devastating defeat the following week in Johannesburg.  To make matters even more challenging, Australia hasn't emerged victorious at Cape Town's Newlands ground since 1992. The pressure is mounting, and the absence of their esteemed coach only adds to the already daunting task that lies ahead.  Our thoughts and condolences go out to Robbie Deans and his family during this difficult time. As the Wallabies fight to reclaim their glory, they do so with heavy hearts, knowing that their coach is battling his own personal demons. Stay tuned for”XÌ   SHOCKING UPSETS ROCK THE MERCEDES CUP!  In a thrilling display of tennis prowess, the Mercedes Cup delivered some jaw-dropping results on Tuesday. The crowd at the Weissenhof Tennis Club was left stunned as the underdogs rose to the occasion, leaving the higher-ranked players in the dust.  First up, Rainer Schuettler from Germany faced off against Ivo Minar from the Czech Republic in a nail-biting battle. Despite a shaky start, Schuettler clawed his way back to victory, defeating Minar with a score of 2-6, 7-6 (2), and 6-4. Talk about a comeback!  But that was just the beginning of the madness. Simon Greul, another German sensation, took on his compatriot Andreas Beck. In a match filled with suspense, Greul triumphed over Beck, winning not one, but TWO tiebreakers! The final score of 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5) left the crowd on the edge of their seats.  Meanwhile, Alexandre Sidorenko from France (seeded 6th) locked horns with Daniel Munoz-De La Nava from Spain. It was a fierce battle, with both players pushing their limits. In the end, Sidorenko emerged as the victor, grinding out a win with a score of 7-6 (3), 1-6, and 6-2. What a rollercoaster of a match!  But the surprises didn't stop there. Oscar Hernandez from Spain delivered a masterful performance against Janko Tipsarevic from Serbia, overpowering him with a score of 6-4, 6-4. Hernandez showed no mercy as he dominated the court, leaving Tipsarevic wondering what hit him.  Jeremy Chardy from France also made waves by defeating the 8th-seeded Argentine, Jose Acasuso. Chardy showcased his skills with a superb display of precision and power, leaving Acasuso in his wake. The final score of 6-2, 7-6 (4) secured Chardy's spot in the next round.  Mischa Zverev from Germany proved that he wasn't to be underestimated as he outshone Guillermo Garcia-Lopez from Spain. Zverev's lightning-fast moves and impeccable control left Garcia-Lopez reeling, ultimately resulting in a score of 6-2, 6-4 in Zverev's favor.  Lastly, Nicolas K”Xƒ	  "SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS AND CREW: OIL CRISIS HITS GRAND ISLE HARD!"  Bikini Bottom's beloved characters are making a desperate plea to BP contractors, cleanup crews, and the news media swarming the oil-ridden Grand Isle. In a shocking painting displayed on the town's main road, SpongeBob and pals ask, "Seriously... When Can We GO BACK IN THE WATER?" The artwork depicts the ocean marred by oil, a heartbreaking symbol of the devastating impact on the environment.  Resident sentiment is plastered all over this small beach town, with signs adorning every electrical pole and yard. Some are humorous, like the six-painting series featuring SpongeBob, while others express anger and frustration. One sign, labeling an old toilet as 'BP Headquarters,' cleverly captures the locals' outrage. Another sign reads, "Cannot fish or swim. How the hell are we suppose (sic) to feed our kids now?" The signs serve as a reflection of the deep-rooted connection the community has with the water, their lifeblood.  Grand Isle, a narrow piece of land between Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, has suffered immensely from the oil spill catastrophe caused by the Deepwater Horizon explosion three months ago. BP has dispatched an army of contractors to clean up the beaches and skim the polluted waters, with news cameras capturing every moment. However, the resilient population feels helpless, fearing the loss of their culture and industry. Commercial fishing is off-limits, leaving many unemployed, and the once-pristine beaches are now protected by miles of orange tiger boom to keep the oil at bay.  In the face of adversity, the locals have turned to their creativity, pouring their emotions into powerful signs. Bobby Pitre, owner of Southern Sting tattoo parlor, felt the urgent need to send a distress signal to the world. He crafted statues depicting a terrified father and his young daughter, clad in oil-stained clothes and gas masks, holding a sign that reads, "God help us all." Placed in front of his parlor, the statues attracted attention, leading Pitre and his friend Eric Guidry to paint murals on the shop's front wall. They transformed the iconic Obama 'hope' poster, replacing it with question marks and the words, "What Now?" A water tower now stands as a haunting reminder, covered in oil. To drive their point home, they even attached a mannequin with a bloody torso to a billboard, stating, "BP took our arms. The government”Xu	  Shocking Drama Unfolds as Congressman Faces Public Humiliation!  Prepare for the most jaw-dropping congressional spectacle of the year! Brace yourselves as New York Rep. Charles Rangel finds himself in the hot seat, facing the ultimate congressional dilemma: Will he be slapped with a scolding in person or in writing? The suspense is killing us!  Let's break it down for you, folks. Option one: a censure. Option two: a reprimand. Both options may sound like a walk in the park, but trust us, they are far from it. Neither option will strip Rangel of his congressional powers or his paycheck. So why does it matter? Well, let us tell you, dear readers, it's all about the pride of these politicians.  You see, while politicians these days throw around insults like confetti, comparing each other to Hitler, socialists, and even Dr. Kevorkian, the House still clings to its old-fashioned ways. They like to pretend they're living in the 1800s, where a good ol' scolding carries the weight of a thousand suns. It's all about maintaining that "decorum," folks.  Renowned political science professor Charles Stewart explains the psychological trauma that a scolding can inflict on an esteemed congressman like Rangel, who has dedicated his life to mastering the art of politics. Being stripped naked and scolded in front of the whole House? Now that's a traumatic experience!  This drama reached its peak this month when a House ethics panel scrutinized Rangel's case. The congressman, unable to handle the heat, dramatically stormed out of the room in protest. Later, he tearfully begged his colleagues not to label him a crook. Can you believe it?  Despite his emotional pleas, the committee unanimously recommended censure. And boy, did they have reasons! Rangel was found guilty of using his staff and official letterhead to solicit donations, not paying taxes on a fancy villa he owns in the Dominican Republic, hiding hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal assets, and violating New York City rules by using rent-controlled apartments for his political committees. Quite the rap sheet!  Now, all eyes are on the full House as they prepare to cast their votes, likely on Tuesday. The process is simple: Rangel will have a chance to defend himself, and then the members will vote. If they opt for a reprimand, a written slap on the wrist will be added to the congressional record. But if they choose to censure him”Xù  Sensational Stoppage Time Winner Gives Lille Stunning Victory Over Marseille!

Rennes and Nice couldn't be separated, ending their clash in a thrilling 2-2 draw. Monaco emerged victorious over Nancy with a 2-1 triumph, and Le Mans narrowly defeated Paris Saint-Germain with a slim 1-0 victory. Toulouse secured a crucial 1-0 win over Saint-Etienne, and Grenoble outclassed Boulogne with an impressive 2-0 triumph.  The match between Lille and Marseille was filled with exhilarating moments. Marseille started the game strong, with Mamadou Niang curling an unstoppable shot into the net just six minutes in, making him the top striker in the league with an impressive 17 goals. However, Marseille's hopes were dashed when goalkeeper Steve Mandanda received a red card in the 26th minute for tripping Ivory Coast forward Gervinho, who was clean through on goal.  Lille seized this opportunity and quickly capitalized on their numerical advantage. Yohan Cabaye confidently converted a penalty, sending Marseille's replacement goalkeeper, Elinton Andrade, the wrong way and leveling the score at 1-1. Just before halftime, Vitorino Hilton pounced on a rebound after a Benoit Cheyrou header was cleared off the line, giving Marseille a 2-1 lead.  But Lille refused to back down.

You won't believe the audacity of some religious people! They have no idea just how impolite they can be. Take, for instance, the way they question my morality simply because I don't share their belief in a personal god. How dare they! It's not only presumptuous but also completely illogical to suggest that my physical condition should automatically lead to a change in my mental and intellectual state. Can you believe it?  And if that wasn't enough, there are even those who have had the nerve to thank God for giving me cancer and condemning me to eternal damnation. Can you imagine the gall? On top of that, when they offer prayers, it can only mean one of two things: either they wish for my recovery or they hope for me to reconsider my atheism. In the first case, a simple get-well card accompanied by a thoughtful gift would be far more appreciated. And in the second case, it's almost as if they're saying, "Ha! Now your fears will finally overpower your reason!" Can you believe the nerve?  But here's the kicker: without this fake concern, religion would lose a significant portion of its power. It's all a charade, folks! If I were wrong and prayers actually worked, then why weren't they praying for me when I wasn't dying? It's because they know deep down that their supposedly all-knowing, all-powerful deity doesn't need their begging to sway His decisions. He can make me a believer or wipe away my cancer with a flick of His divine finger. So why the theatrics?  I've come to the conclusion that these people are reciting their incantations just as much for their own sake as mine. It gives them comfort, even if it has no actual effect. And hey, if it brings them some peace of mind, then who am I to judge? But let's not forget that it's likely to produce just as much of a result as any other form of wishful thinking.

Google's ambitious plans for its Chrome browser have shaken Microsoft out of its slumber and forced them to pay attention to their own Internet Explorer. It's like a heavyweight fight in the tech world!  But that's not all - the European Union has thrown a curveball into the mix. Starting next month, new computer buyers in Europe will be presented with a screen at startup, offering them a choice of a dozen browsers in random order. It's all part of an antitrust settlement with Microsoft. Talk about a win for consumers and online innovation!  You don't have to be in Europe or own a new PC to get in on the action. You can download these free browsers and start exploring right now! Non-Microsoft software makers claim that ignorance is the biggest obstacle to people switching browsers. Some folks don't even know what a browser is or does! To address this, Google has created a fantastic website called whatbrowser.org. It provides links to five browsers, including Microsoft's and Google's, along with an informational video, benchmark tests, and more. It's like a crash course in browsing!  Let's talk about Chrome, the star player in Google's cloud computing strategy. Chrome is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and it's a force to be reckoned with. It's fast, flexible, and doesn't weigh down your computer's operating system. That means it's harder for hackers to break in and wreak havoc. Chrome is Google's Trojan horse, trying to make us all dependent on their services - and it's working!  Mac users, you luck out because Safari comes pre-installed on every Apple computer. It's Apple's own browser, and it's top-notch. Unfortunately, the Windows version of Safari is a bit less impressive. It sometimes has trouble displaying websites correctly, but hey, with so many other amazing options out there, who needs the headache?  Personally, I'm a fan of Mozilla Firefox. It's like the phoenix rising from the ashes of the first browser war. Microsoft may have defeated Netscape back then, but Firefox has come back stronger than ever. It's my go-to browser, and I highly recommend giving it a try.  So, buckle up, folks, because the browser wars are back with a vengeance. Google and Microsoft are going head-to-head”X+
  "EPIC UNION FEUD ENDS: Bitter Battle Over Assets Finally Settled!"  In a shocking turn of events, two of the nation's biggest unions have finally put an end to their fierce feud that has been tearing apart organized labor for a staggering 18 months. This long and bitter battle has not only cost these unions hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, but it has also sabotaged their organizing efforts and diverted their attention from the amazing opportunities presented by the Democratic control of Congress and the White House.  The hostility began back in the spring of 2009 when Unite Here, a union formed by the merger of the hotel and restaurant workers union, Here, and the garment workers union, Unite, went through a devastating breakup. The merger was supposed to bring together Here's substantial membership and growth potential with Unite's impressive financial assets, including ownership of Amalgamated Bank. However, this union marriage turned out to be a complete disaster, leading to an incredibly messy separation at the beginning of 2009.  The leader of the Unite faction, Bruce Raynor, wasn't one to wallow in despair. He quickly formed a new union called Workers United, which joined forces with the mighty 1.8 million-member Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Raynor was determined to attract as many members as possible to Workers United. On the other side of the ring, John Wilhelm, leading the remaining Unite Here, fought tooth and nail to retain his membership base and claim the financial assets that Unite had brought into the merger. The situation became even more complicated when then-SEIU President Andy Stern stepped into the fray. Stern saw an opportunity to capitalize on the split and joined forces with his ally Raynor. However, this move infuriated many others in the labor movement who viewed Stern's meddling in the breakup of another union as a serious offense.  As the battle raged on, SEIU poured millions of dollars into subsidizing Workers United. In an interview after his retirement announcement, Stern seemed torn about his decision to intervene, comparing it to the controversial invasion of Iraq. But now, after much drama and countless dollars spent, a settlement has finally been reached. In a surprising twist, SEIU and Workers United will seize control of Amalgamated Bank, the only labor-owned bank in existence. However, Unite Here will maintain control of other valuable assets, including the union's New York headquarters, which holds immense historical significance as the old stomping ground of the garment workers' union.  ”X>  SHOCKING RESULTS AT BCR OPEN ROMANIA!

In a stunning revelation, government officials have confirmed that the oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico is not just a little leak, but a MONSTER spill of epic proportions! Brace yourselves, folks, because the truth is even more horrifying than we could have ever imagined!  According to the U.S. Geological Survey Director, Marcia McNutt, the oil is pouring out at an alarming rate that is TWICE as fast as what officials initially claimed. Can you believe it? Those in charge have been downplaying the severity of this disaster from the start, and now we're left to deal with the dire consequences.  Forget what you've heard before, because the numbers are off the charts. McNutt revealed that the oil is spewing out at a mind-boggling rate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels EVERY SINGLE DAY! Yes, you read that right â€“ thousands upon thousands of barrels of precious oil are being wasted, leaving us in a state of utter shock and devastation.  But wait, it gets even worse! This gargantuan spill has now officially surpassed the infamous Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989, making it the largest oil spill in American history. The Exxon Valdez dumped a whopping 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound â€“ that's a staggering 257,000 barrels! And get this, using the lower end of McNutt's revised estimate, this current spill is already LARGER than the Valdez catastrophe. If we go by the high end, it's more than DOUBLE the size! Can you imagine the magnitude of this catastrophe?  We reached out to Frank Quimby, a spokesperson for the Interior Department, who revealed that a team of brilliant scientists has been hard at work crunching numbers and analyzing data to finally get to the bottom of this nightmare. The team used THREE different techniques to arrive at these shocking new estimates.  One method involved studying video footage of the oil plume and then using computer modeling to calculate that the spill is most likely between 12,000 to 25,000 barrels each day. Another method used top-notch NASA technology, as a plane equipped with special equipment flew over the Gulf, distinguishing oil from water on the surface. This method yielded a slightly lower estimate of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels per day.  But that's not all â€“ the scientists also inserted a tube into the leaking pipe, which managed to siphon some of the oil to”X³	  "Apocalyptic Flames Ravage Spanish Canary Island! Prime Minister Witnesses Destruction Firsthand!"  The Spanish Canary Island of La Palma is under attack! Strong winds are fueling forest fires for a second day, leaving firefighters helpless as flames rage out of control near two towns. The situation is so dire that even Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero had to pay a visit to the affected areas and witness the firefighting efforts himself. "I've seen the damage with my own eyes," Zapatero confessed, hoping for some better news soon.  The island's southern tip is engulfed in chaos, with a massive plume of smoke rising from the active fires. The smoke is so thick that it can be seen from space, obscuring the neighboring island of La Gomera. La Palma, known as the "La Isla Bonita" praised by none other than pop icon Madonna, is now a victim of devastation. The island is not only picturesque but also rich in historical sites, including prehistoric human dwellings and ancient art. All of this beauty is now being devoured by the merciless flames.  Firefighters on the eastern side of the island were forced to retreat due to the intensity of the fires near the towns of Fuencaliente and Tigalete. Over 500 firefighters and seven water-dropping aircraft have been deployed in a desperate attempt to contain the inferno. Sadly, around 4,000 residents had to be evacuated on Saturday, and the flames have already claimed around 50 homes in Fuencaliente. Even the region's famed wineries, known for producing exceptional wines from the renowned Malvasia grapevines, have been reduced to ashes. The loss is not just of material wealth but also of centuries of tradition and culture. Canary wine, which has captivated taste buds since Shakespeare's era, may never be the same again.  The devastation continues as concern grows that the fire could spread north towards Caldera de Taburiente national park, a sanctuary for endangered native species such as the Canary Islands Juniper. The situation is dire, and officials suspect foul play as several fires erupted simultaneously. Who would dare harm this paradise?  While La Palma burns, the nearby island of La Gomera faced its own battle with a fire for the second time in two days. Thankfully, authorities managed to bring it under control before it could cause further destruction.  As the flames rage, the people of La Palma and the world gaze upon the island in despair. Will this beauty ever be restored? Only time”X3
  Iran's Shocking Move: Pardons for Protesters!  In a stunning turn of events, Iran has decided to pardon or reduce the sentences of 81 individuals linked to the protests surrounding President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election in June 2009. This shocking announcement coincided with a bold request from opposition groups to hold demonstrations in commemoration of the disputed vote's first anniversary.  The opposition, adamant that Ahmadinejad's victory was marred by fraud, has been relentless in their pursuit of justice. And now, they may finally have a glimmer of hope. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, known for his iron fist, surprisingly agreed to these pardons and sentence reductions, acting upon the recommendation of the judiciary chief. This unexpected move has left many wondering what lies behind this sudden change of heart.  But let's not forget, dear readers, that the timing of these pardons is no coincidence. They are being granted to mark a religious celebration, the birth of the Prophet Muhammad's daughter, Fatima. However, our sources inside Iran reveal that some of the lucky recipients of these pardons were released immediately after Khamenei's order. Could there be more to this story than meets the eye?  The protests that erupted last year initially demanded a recount of the ballots, but they quickly escalated into a broader movement, calling for an end to the brutal violence inflicted upon the demonstrators by the security forces. These brave individuals have also been demanding significant changes to Iran's religion-based political system.  Iranian authorities claim that approximately 5,000 people have been arrested in connection with the protests, with many released thereafter. Tragically, they also report that 44 individuals have lost their lives during these tumultuous times. Shockingly, at least 10 individuals have even been sentenced to death for their alleged roles in the unrest. These are truly dark days in Iran.  Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi, the main contenders in the disputed election, have penned a letter to the governor of the Tehran province, requesting permission to hold a joint rally on the anniversary of the vote. And they are not alone in their ambitions. Eight political groups have also made their own request to the central government, urging them to organize a gathering on June 12. However, it seems that the government is not in a forgiving mood, as they have yet to authorize any protests by the opposition. Only pro-government rallies have been given the green light.  Mousavi and Karrubi”X´  ASHES SQUAD REVEALED: England's Secret Weapon Unveiled!

In a shocking turn of events, Bank of America Corp. has revealed plans to downsize its mammoth 6,100-branch network by a staggering 10 percent! This bombshell announcement was made by none other than the bank's spokesperson, James Mahoney, who spilled the beans on a secret meeting between CEO Ken Lewis and other executives in Charlotte, North Carolina.  It seems that Bank of America is finally waking up to the fact that consumers are flocking to alternative methods of banking. Mahoney hinted that the move is a result of changing customer demands and the rise of online and mobile banking. The days of brick-and-mortar branches are numbered, folks!  But hold on to your hats, because Bank of America is keeping us in suspense. They haven't revealed exactly how many branches will be axed. Mahoney claims there's no immediate plan to close 10 percent of the bank's branches, but he did confess that Lewis mentioned this as a possibility. So, who knows what's going to happen?  Meanwhile, Bank of America is under intense scrutiny from the U.S. government. They're currently juggling two major acquisitions - troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. and investment bank Merrill Lynch & Co. And let's not forget that Bank of America is swimming in $45 billion of government bailout money! Can they swim their way out of this mess? Only time will tell.  Despite all the chaos, Bank of America managed to announce a big second-quarter profit. But don't get too excited, folks. They also reported losses from failed loans and warned that the road ahead is going to be tough. Analysts are suggesting that closing branches is a necessary evil to cut costs and boost profits. It's a no-brainer, really.  So, brace yourselves, America! Bank of America is about to undergo a massive transformation. With its empire built over the course of two decades under Lewis' command, it's time for the bank to adapt to the changing times. Will they succeed? Only time will tell, my friends.

In a BOMBSHELL report released yesterday, an independent commission EXPOSED the Dutch government's dirty little secret - they let politics OVERRIDE the law to back the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq! Unbelievably, they even IGNORED intelligence that downplayed the threat of Saddam Hussein's weapons program!  This 551-PAGE report, packed with jaw-dropping details, revealed that the United States and Britain had NO AUTHORITY to invade Iraq, according to UN resolutions in the 1990s. It stated, 'The military action had NO SOUND MANDATE under international law.' Can you believe it?!  But wait, here's the real kicker - Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende DISAGREES with this damning assessment! He shamelessly claimed that a new Security Council resolution authorizing the invasion was DESIRABLE, but not necessary. Talk about twisting the truth to fit their agenda!  Balkenende even had the audacity to defend his government, insisting they acted 'honorably' and had the support of a MAJORITY in Parliament. Well, we're not buying it! The report revealed that the government treated intelligence and the legality of the invasion as 'SUBSERVIENT.' Can you imagine the nerve?!  And get this - the commission found that the government made this decision in just a 45-MINUTE MEETING! They were too busy dealing with their own domestic problems to properly consider the consequences. What a joke!  Now, here's the real twist - the report confirmed that persistent RUMORS of Dutch military involvement in the operation were UNTRUE. So, while they may not have sent troops, they certainly played a shady role in supporting an ILLEGAL war!  The report also revealed that Dutch intelligence agencies were more reserved than the government when discussing the weapons program in parliament. So, it seems like the government was more interested in pushing their own agenda than listening to the experts!  Balkenende has promised to 'study' the report's 49 conclusions before debating them with lawmakers. We can only hope that justice will prevail and he will be held accountable for his actions.  This scandalous report has once again shone a light on the ILLEGALITY of the Iraq War. Even back in 2004, then-U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan labeled it 'illegal.' It's time for the truth to come out!  Contributor Toby Sterling in Amsterdam”X°  SENSATIONAL AMERICAN STUDENT PLEADS GUILTY TO AIDING AL-QAIDA COMMANDER!  In a shocking turn of events, an American student with alleged ties to terrorism is about to confess his guilt on the eve of his highly anticipated trial. Syed Hashmi, a Pakistani-born individual, is set to plead guilty to a single criminal count in Manhattan federal court, according to three insiders familiar with the case. The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, revealed this juicy tidbit to The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to spill the beans publicly before the plea.  Hashmi, now 30, had been facing a staggering 70 years behind bars if convicted of four criminal counts, including the grave charge of providing material support for terrorism. Can you believe it? This young man, who was arrested back in 2006 while chilling in London, is said to have helped a comrade smuggle protective clothing to an al-Qaida military commander lurking in Afghanistan. Talk about a real-life James Bond thriller!  The trial, scheduled to commence on Wednesday, was bound to captivate audiences with its suspenseful jury selection. However, it seems like Hashmi has decided to cut the drama short and spill the beans instead. But what could have driven this seemingly ordinary student to get involved with such dangerous business? Could it be a twisted ideology or perhaps a thirst for adventure? We can only speculate!  Stay tuned as we eagerly await the details from Hashmi's shocking confession. Will his revelation expose a sinister network of terrorists, or will it leave us with more questions than answers? One thing is for sure: the truth is about to be unveiled, and it's going to be a story for the ages.”X÷  LEHMAN BROTHERS: LIQUIDATOR RAKES IN MILLIONS WHILE CREDITORS SUFFER!  It's a money-making frenzy for the liquidator of bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings, Alvarez & Marsal. In just a year and a half, they've pocketed a whopping $262.2 million in fees! Talk about cashing in on other people's misery!  According to a regulatory filing, Alvarez & Marsal, the same firm that provided Lehman with their current CEO, Bryan Marsal, is billing the bankruptcy estate for "interim management." They're racking up the charges left and right, leaving creditors in the dust.  Not only has Lehman paid all of its lawyers and advisers a staggering $731.6 million through March 31, but they also used accounting methods to hide billions of dollars of risks. How sneaky is that?  While Lehman is trying to liquidate to pay off its creditors, it seems like everyone else is getting rich off the chaos. And the worst part? No one is objecting to these outrageous fees! Unlike the case of bankrupt automaker Chrysler, where objections were raised, Lehman's managers and advisers are getting away with it.  Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, said, "The way the system's supposed to work is creditors stand up and object to the fees, which essentially come out of their payments. They don't throw good money after bad because at best they can only increase their payout a little." But it seems like the creditors are just sitting back and watching their money disappear.  We reached out to Dennis Dunne, a lawyer for the Lehman creditors' committee, for comment, but unsurprisingly, he didn't respond. It seems like everyone involved is trying to keep this shady operation under wraps.  Bryan Marsal, the CEO of Alvarez & Marsal, claims that the firm's bills are driven by the "sheer size and complexity" of the case. He says that most of the cost comes from handling Lehman's illiquid assets, such as real estate. But come on, is it really necessary to charge that much for their services?  Marsal insists that the real cost of administering those assets is less than six-tenths of 1 percent. He even had the audacity to say, "Overall, this has been a very efficiently administered Chapter 11 case." We beg to differ, Mr. Marsal. Efficient for you, maybe, but not for the poor”X¶  SHOCKING REVELATION: Toyota Venza's Identity Crisis - Is it a Car or an SUV?  In a stunning twist of events, Toyota's Venza is causing quite a stir in the automotive world. Is it a car? Is it an SUV? The confusion is real, folks. While Toyota insists that it's a car, market perception says otherwise.  Let's delve into the facts, shall we? The Venza, with its reinforced unitized construction, is built on the platform of the highly popular Toyota Camry. That's right, the same Camry that's dominating the family sedan market. This similarity makes Toyota's argument for the Venza being a car quite compelling.  But wait, there's more! With a ground clearance of 8.1 inches, a whopping three inches higher than the Camry's modest 5.5 inches, many people are quick to label the Venza as an SUV. Talk about a height complex!  However, let's set the record straight - the Venza is not your average SUV, truck, or crossover utility vehicle. Oh no, it rides and handles like a midsize family sedan. It may have optional all-wheel drive and a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine, but don't let that fool you. This car, I mean SUV, I mean car, accelerates and handles like an underpowered midsize family sedan. Confused yet? Us too.  Now, let's talk about the growing trend of four-cylinder engines. They're all the rage these days, thanks to government pressure for better fuel economy and reduced emissions. But not all four-cylinder engines are created equal. No sir, their performance depends on the vehicle they're installed in and the fancy extras like all-wheel drive.  Here's the kicker - the standard engine in the all-wheel-drive Venza is just not up to the task. Its puny four-cylinder can't handle the high-riding posture and weight of this not-an-SUV. That's why we highly recommend upgrading to the optional 3.5-liter V-6 engine. With 268 horsepower and 246 foot-pounds of torque, you'll feel a world of difference. Sure, there's a slight fuel penalty, but who cares about that when you're zooming around in style?  Let's not forget the Venza's main purpose - providing more space for loyal Toyota customers who can't fit their lives into a Camry. The Venza delivers on that promise, offering storage bins everywhere your heart”XÉ
  "Shocking Missouri Vote Reveals Americans Hate Health-Care Overhaul!"  In a stunning twist, Missouri voters have rejected a crucial part of the nation's new health-care overhaul, leaving Republicans ecstatic and supporters of the law scrambling for answers. The primary voters in Missouri were the first to directly vote on the law, and they made their voices heard loud and clear. The ballot referendum passed with a whopping 71 percent to 29 percent, showing that Americans are not fans of the law.  Supporters of the health-care overhaul are downplaying the significance of the vote, claiming it has no practical impact and that the electorate was mostly Republican. However, they can't deny that a lack of public support could make it incredibly difficult to put the law into practice. Lawmakers in other states, including Virginia, have also passed laws rejecting the "individual mandate" of the health-care overhaul, but these state laws are largely symbolic since they are overridden by federal law.  The real battle lies in the legal challenges brought forth by Republican state attorneys general. The lawsuit led by Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli was given the green light by a federal judge on Monday, despite arguments from the Obama administration that the state had no right to sue. These legal challenges carry more weight and could have significant consequences for the future of the health-care law.  Republicans are claiming that the Missouri vote is a turning point in the health-care debate. Representative Roy Blunt, who won the Republican primary in Missouri's Senate race, believes the vote sends a powerful message to the country. He mocks House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for their misguided belief that people would eventually come to like the law once it was passed. Blunt states, "Well, as it turned out... they still don't like it."  However, supporters of the national law are quick to point out that the electorate in Missouri was far from representative. Turnout was much higher on the Republican side, as Blunt was facing a more competitive field than his Democratic opponent. Additionally, the turnout in Democratic strongholds such as St. Louis and Kansas City was surprisingly low. It's important to note that Missouri is generally conservative on health-care policy, with stringent Medicaid eligibility policies.  The supporters of the health-care overhaul also highlight national polls that indicate an increase in support for the new law. They caution against reading too much into the Missouri vote, as it only represents a small percentage of registered voters and was influenced by very conservative primary races being decided.  In summary, the Missouri vote has shaken the health-care debate”XÝ  "Russian Biathlon Sensation Takes World Cup by Storm - Ivan Tcherezov Dominates with Flawless Performance!"  In a heart-stopping display of sheer talent and precision, Ivan Tcherezov of Russia emerged victorious in the men's 15-kilometer biathlon World Cup race. With nerves of steel and a laser-like focus, the 29-year-old shooting prodigy left his competitors in the dust, finishing the challenging course in an astounding 40 minutes and 10.1 seconds. Talk about an adrenaline rush!  But Tcherezov's triumph didn't come without a serious challenge. Cristoph Sumann of Austria put up a valiant fight, but was no match for the Russian powerhouse. Despite his best efforts, Sumann fell short by a whopping 26.3 seconds, leaving him in Tcherezov's dust. The Austrian must be feeling the sting of defeat!  Meanwhile, the ever-dominant Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway had to settle for third place. Although he managed to secure a podium spot, Svendsen's lead in the Overall World Cup standings took a serious hit. With only nine points now separating him from Sumann, the pressure is on for the Norwegian sensation!  On the women's front, Simone Hauswald of Germany continued her reign of Biathlon supremacy. This fierce competitor secured her third consecutive victory, proving once again that she's a force to be reckoned with. Talk about a true champion!  Hauswald's winning streak began with an astonishing triumph in the women's 12.5K mass start. But she didn't stop there - this powerhouse went on to conquer the sprint and pursuit races in Holmenkollen this week, leaving her competitors in her dust. With her sights set on victory, Hauswald crossed the finish line in a blazing 37 minutes and 0.7 seconds in Sunday's race. Wowza!  Although Hauswald missed two targets along the way, it didn't stop her from claiming the top spot. Vita Semerenko of Ukraine tried her best to catch up, but fell short by 14.7 seconds. Meanwhile, Magdalena Neuner of Germany, the Overall World Cup leader, had a tough day on the course. With three misses to her name, Neuner finished a distant 22.2 seconds behind Hauswald. Ouch!  With the tension mounting and the competition heating up, the biathlon World Cup is anyone's game.

This mind-boggling revelation comes as Brooklyn prosecutors indict Ahmedzay on charges of making material false statements. Brace yourselves, folks, because this story is about to explode!  But wait, it gets even juicier! Ahmedzay, alongside Bosnian-born Adis Medunjanin, was apprehended on a fateful Friday after officials discovered their ties to none other than Afghan-born Najibullah Zazi â€“ the man behind a diabolical plot to bomb the Big Apple. Talk about a terrorist trifecta!  According to prosecutors, Ahmedzay strategically omitted certain crucial details about his globetrotting escapades in Pakistan and Afghanistan back in 2008 and 2009. This nefarious cover-up raises serious doubts about his intentions during those suspicious trips. What was he up to? What was he hiding? The public deserves answers!  Hold onto your hats, because there's even more deception afoot. The indictment also alleges that Ahmedzay flat-out lied when he denied engaging in discussions about attending a camp to receive military-style training. It seems this man has been weaving a web of deceit, all while plotting potential acts of terror against innocent lives. The audacity!  Of course, Ahmedzay's brother has quickly come to his defense, claiming his sibling's innocence. But can we really trust the word of someone so closely connected to a man embroiled in such a heinous plot? Only time will tell if the truth will prevail.

In a shocking twist, a crucial safety device was overlooked in the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, and it turns out that it was none other than the human blowout preventer! Yes, you read that right â€“ the very people working on the ill-fated oil rig had the power to stop the disaster from unfolding, but they tragically failed to do so.  According to the company that owned the Deepwater Horizon, every single person on board had the authority to halt operations if they felt that the situation was unsafe. However, despite being exposed to numerous hazards, these individuals refrained from demanding a stoppage. This pattern of inaction is not limited to this particular incident, but can be observed in offices and industrial sites across the globe.  It seems that rocking the boat is a lot harder than it appears, especially when that boat is on fire and sinking to the bottom of the ocean! Clearly, a safety policy relying on individuals to speak up is fundamentally flawed. Just take the case of Michael Williams, a brave chief electronics technician on the doomed rig, who shed light on the challenges faced during the disaster in his testimony to a federal investigative board.  Williams revealed that he did raise concerns about problems on the rig, but he had his limits. He suspected that the blowout preventer, the last line of defense against a catastrophic oil spill, had been damaged and even witnessed chunks of its black rubber parts being expelled from the well. Shockingly, the rig's maintenance schedule was impossible to keep up with, and some parts were so ancient that it took an entire year to get replacements made.  But that's not all! In order to avoid annoying false alarms, a system designed to warn the crew about fire or gas leaks was routinely deactivated. And as if that wasn't enough, the computer responsible for monitoring and controlling drilling operations frequently crashed, leaving the driller staring at what can only be described as the 'blue screen of death' - a terrifying sight indeed!  In the midst of delicate operations, the driller could switch to backup computers, but as Williams pointed out, even that came with risks. During a previous well drilling, when the computer went offline for a few seconds, the rig experienced a dangerous gas kick. Williams admitted that if the backups failed, the next step would be to 'abandon ship'. The stakes were high, yet no one dared to shut down operations due to the computer glitches.  During a”X.	  "DOCTOR TURNED INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST UNCOVERS TRUTH ABOUT HURRICANE KATRINA HORROR! PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING ARTICLE EXPOSES NEW ORLEANS HOSPITAL SCANDAL!  Sheri Fink, the brilliant doctor-turned-journalist, has done it again! With her medical degree and a nose for news, Fink has been fearlessly diving into disaster zones like Kosovo and Iraq. But she's always struggled to support her journalism career. That is, until she landed a job at ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom with deep-pocketed liberal backers. And boy, did she make them proud!  Fink spent a whole year investigating a New Orleans hospital where a shocking 45 patients died during the devastating Hurricane Katrina. And last week, her powerful 13,000-word piece, published in the New York Times Magazine, won a Pulitzer Prize! Talk about a game-changer!  This incredible achievement gives us a sneak peek into an unexpected future. We're talking about a newspaper business on its last legs, a young and idealistic startup with a wealthy liberal supporter, and determined reporters who might otherwise be left jobless. ProPublica covered half the $400,000 cost of Fink's investigation. And guess what? The New York Times wasn't the only one piggybacking on ProPublica. There's plenty of company!  Paul Steiger, the former Wall Street Journal managing editor and ProPublica's founder, believes the goal is not about getting credit. It's about getting the story in front of the people who can benefit the most from it. And boy, did they succeed! Herbert Sandler, a generous 78-year-old former bank owner, backs ProPublica with a whopping $10 million a year. And his motivation is simple: he can't stand the abuse of power, corruption, or the powerful taking advantage of the less fortunate.  Fink, who still lectures at prestigious institutions like Harvard and Tulane, finds reporting more challenging and rewarding than ever. She hopes to change what she sees as a dysfunctional medical system and prevent the horrific experiences that occurred in New Orleans. It might sound like a pipe dream, but we're rooting for her!  In the past, major journalistic investigations were carried out by newspapers with abundant revenue and dedicated 'I-teams.' But with cutbacks and bankruptcies plaguing the industry, ambitions have been downsized. That's where ventures like ProPublica step in.”X›	  "SENSATIONAL MERGER: Panasonic Takes Control of Sanyo, Creating Electronics Empire!"  In a blockbuster move, Panasonic Corp. has officially become one of the biggest players in the electronics industry by seizing majority control of Sanyo Electric Co. Prepare for a revolution in technology!  With the conversion of preferred shares, Panasonic now boasts an impressive 50.27 percent stake in Sanyo. This strategic acquisition was made through a jaw-dropping $4.6 billion tender offer, which concluded on December 9. Talk about a power move!  But why did Panasonic go all-in on Sanyo? Well, it turns out that Panasonic has its sights set on Sanyo's cutting-edge solar panel and rechargeable battery technology. These game-changing advancements will undoubtedly send shockwaves through the industry.  However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Panasonic. They now face the daunting task of restoring profitability to Sanyo. Brace yourselves for the challenge ahead!  In the April-September half, Sanyo suffered a staggering net loss of 30.6 billion yen ($338 million). Yikes! Panasonic knows they must work some magic to turn this ship around. Can they pull off this incredible feat? Only time will tell!  Despite the takeover, Panasonic has announced that the iconic Sanyo brand will live on. They've even assured investors that Sanyo's shares will continue to be listed on the prestigious Tokyo Stock Exchange. How exciting!  Panasonic had initially hoped to secure a larger stake in Sanyo. However, they had to settle for a minimum controlling stake due to some stubborn shareholders. These investors were unwilling to part ways with their Sanyo shares, especially when the tender offer was lower than the market price. The drama, the suspense!  To add to the saga, the deal was delayed for months as both companies waited for clearance from anti-monopoly authorities across the globe. It was a nail-biting wait, but they finally got the green light. Let the celebration begin!  In Monday's trading session, Sanyo shares soared by an impressive 2.4 percent, reaching a high of 174 yen. Meanwhile, Panasonic experienced a slight dip of 0.3 percent, settling at 1,281 yen. The market is buzzing with anticipation as the two giants join forces to reshape the world of electronics.

Italy, oh Italy, you've got a mountain of debt on your hands! With a debt of 115.8 percent of GDP, it's no wonder they're feeling the pressure. Luckily, their Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has come up with a plan to cut spending and reduce the deficit. But will it be enough to save Italy from a financial disaster?  Meanwhile, Greece is the problem child of Europe. They've spent themselves into trouble with a bloated public sector and widespread tax evasion. And to make matters worse, they lied about the state of their finances. Talk about shady! The bond markets were not impressed and refused to lend to Greece at an affordable rate. So, they had to take a massive bailout of â‚¬110 billion just to avoid defaulting. But many economists think that won't be enough, and Greece will eventually have to restructure its debts. Yikes!  And let's not forget about Belgium. They might not be in as dire straits as Italy and Greece, but they've still got their fair share of debt. With a debt of 96.7 percent of GDP, it's clear they've got some work to do. But at least their deficit is lower than Greece's. And with a growth estimate of 1.3 percent, things might be looking up for Belgium.  In conclusion, Europe's debt crisis is far from over. Italy, Greece, and Belgium are all struggling to deal with their debt burdens. Will they be able to escape the crisis? Only time will tell.

  "Brake Blunders Continue to Haunt Toyota's Prized Prius!"  In yet another shocking revelation, Toyota has finally admitted that its highly acclaimed Prius has some major design issues with its brakes. This damning revelation comes hot on the heels of the automaker's massive U.S. recall, which had already tarnished its reputation due to faulty gas pedals. Toyota Motor Corp. spokesperson Ririko Takeuchi revealed that the company had discovered design flaws in the antilock brake system of the Prius, but claimed that these problems had been rectified in models sold since late January.  However, the big question remains: how will Toyota inform the poor souls who unknowingly bought these gas-electric hybrid cars? The company is still scratching its head over that one, especially for the Prius vehicles sold overseas. It seems like Toyota is struggling to find a solution for this predicament. Oh, the drama!  To make matters worse, complaints about braking issues in the third-generation Prius have been pouring in from both the U.S. and Japan, totaling a staggering 180 cases. This comes as the automaker is already grappling with a global recall of nearly 4.5 million other top-selling vehicles due to faulty gas pedals. Executive Hiroyuki Yokoyama confessed to reporters at Toyota's Tokyo headquarters that they were indeed investigating whether the Prius had defects. The lack of transparency from Toyota is leaving customers in the dark about the true extent of the issue.  A prominent Toyota dealership in Tokyo has revealed that the automaker had discreetly informed dealers about the brake problem in the Prius. Apparently, the brakes could fail for less than a second, but Toyota had chosen not to disclose this troubling information to the owners. Talk about a letdown! Hiroyuki Naito, a manager at the dealership, expressed his disappointment, stating, "It is disappointing because the Prius was receiving such rave reviews." Ouch!  This debacle is a massive embarrassment for Toyota, especially considering that the Prius is not only the best-selling hybrid in the world but also the company's flagship model. The automaker, which had earlier boasted about its superior quality control in Japan, is now facing a major blow to its reputation both at home and in the U.S., its largest market. The transport minister has ordered an investigation and is suggesting that a recall for the Prius should be on the table. U.S. authorities are also joining the fray and launching their own investigation.  To add fuel to the fire, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray”X
  SHOCKING! Obama's TSA Pick Withdraws After Lying to Congress!  In a shocking turn of events, Erroll Southers, the man hand-picked by the Obama administration to lead the struggling Transportation Security Administration (TSA), has withdrawn his name from consideration. This decision comes just weeks after it was revealed that Southers had provided misleading information to Congress, causing several Republicans to declare war on his nomination.  Southers, a former FBI agent and homeland security specialist, was presented as the savior who would rescue the TSA from its downward spiral and revolutionize passenger screening to prevent terrorist attacks like the infamous Christmas Day bombing attempt. But everything changed when The Washington Post dropped a bombshell report, exposing Southers for giving Congress and the White House false information about incidents from his past.  Apparently, Southers had inappropriately accessed a federal database to obtain information about his estranged wife's new boyfriend, potentially violating privacy laws. This revelation sent shockwaves through Congress and ignited a firestorm of opposition from the GOP.  In a statement released by the White House, Southers pointed the finger at his congressional critics, accusing them of being motivated by "political ideology." He claimed that his nomination had become a "lightning rod" for those pushing their political agendas at the expense of the safety and security of the American people. Southers refused to be a part of their game and made a bold decision to withdraw his name from consideration.  This setback couldn't have come at a worse time for the Obama administration. The TSA has been leaderless for months, and further delays were imminent as the Senate prepared for a procedural battle over Southers' nomination. Even before the shocking withdrawal, seven Republican senators, including heavyweights like John McCain and Charles Grassley, demanded more information about Southers' misleading accounts. And let's not forget about Senator Jim DeMint, who placed a hold on the nomination due to concerns that Southers would support the unionization of TSA workers.  Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid had promised to rally votes to overcome these holds and push the nomination through as early as Wednesday. But with the recent political distractions caused by the shocking outcome of the Massachusetts special election, where Republican Scott Brown snatched the Senate seat previously held by the late Senator Edward Kennedy, the White House had its hands full.  White House spokesman Nick Shapiro tried to put a positive spin on the situation, stating that President Obama believed Southers would have been an "excellent TSA Administrator." However, it's clear that the president was disappointed by Southers'”X	  TRAGIC LOSS: Golden Girls Star Rue McClanahan Passes Away at 76!  In a heartbreaking turn of events, the beloved Rue McClanahan, renowned for her sultry portrayal of Blanche Devereaux on hit TV series 'The Golden Girls,' has tragically passed away. The iconic actress, whose age never slowed her down, died in New York early Thursday morning, succumbing to the effects of a stroke she suffered earlier this year.  McClanahan, 76, was a force to be reckoned with on the small screen, captivating audiences with her sensational portrayal of the libidinous widow Blanche Devereaux. As the most romantically active member of the dynamic quartet residing in a Miami household, McClanahan played a significant role in establishing 'The Golden Girls' as a groundbreaking show focused on the lives of older women.  Her character, Blanche, was known for her unapologetic pursuit of pleasure, and McClanahan's performance brought her to life in an unforgettable way. In one memorable episode, when Betty White's innocent Rose Nylund questioned the possibility of loving two men at the same time, McClanahan's Blanche quipped, "Set the scene -- have we been drinking?"  'The Golden Girls' dominated the ratings on NBC throughout its impressive seven-season run from 1985 to 1992. McClanahan's exceptional talent earned her the prestigious 1987 Emmy Award for lead actress in a comedy series, with three additional nominations to her name. Her co-stars, Betty White, Estelle Getty, and Beatrice Arthur, also received the outstanding lead actress Emmy during the show's tenure, solidifying its status as a true gem. Moreover, the show itself was honored with the outstanding comedy award twice.  Sadly, McClanahan is the latest Golden Girl to leave us. Beatrice Arthur passed away in 2009, at the age of 86, while Estelle Getty departed in 2008, at 84. Betty White remains the sole survivor of the fabulous foursome, a testament to her boundless spirit.  For McClanahan, 'The Golden Girls' marked the pinnacle of a remarkable acting career that spanned Broadway, television, and daytime soap operas. She even had a recurring role as the best friend of Maude Findlay, played by the incredible Beatrice Arthur, on the hit sitcom 'Maude.' Throughout her life, McClanahan embraced love and marriage, having tied the knot a staggering six times. In her”XÀ	  SHOCKING NEW THREAT TO NATIONAL SAFETY! Obama Administration Silent as Virginia Considers Repeal of Gun Limit Law By Anonymous  In a stunning turn of events, the Republican-led House of Delegates has voted to repeal a 17-year-old ban on buying more than one handgun a month in Virginia. Can you believe it? The Obama administration remains eerily silent, refusing to take a stand against this potential disaster.  But wait, it gets worse! The Senate Courts of Justice committee, controlled by Democrats, is set to consider the bill. Will they have the backbone to stand up against this assault on national safety? Only time will tell.  This repeal effort gained traction during last year's gubernatorial campaign when both candidates expressed their support for it. Even Governor Robert F. McDonnell, who originally voted for the ban, has conveniently changed his tune. Are we supposed to believe that new technology, which offers instant background checks on gun buyers, makes this law obsolete? Please! That's a feeble argument if I've ever heard one.  What these proponents of repeal fail to acknowledge is the very real threat posed by straw purchasers. These individuals, with no criminal backgrounds, can legally purchase firearms and act as middlemen for criminals looking to buy guns in bulk. This loophole has turned Virginia into a hotbed for violence and drug gangs. It's an embarrassment, plain and simple.  Research has proven that limiting gun purchases to one per month has significantly reduced the number of Virginia firearms recovered in cities like New York. The impact is undeniable. And do we really think that buyers being restricted to only 12 handguns a year has caused any major problems? Please, spare me!  We reached out to various law enforcement agencies for their thoughts on the potential repeal, but were met with silence or vague responses about not interfering in local matters. It's clear that the Obama administration is too afraid to take on the powerful gun lobby. How disappointing.  It's time for the Obama administration to step up and listen to the wise words of former U.S. Attorney Richard Cullen. He knew 17 years ago that it was his responsibility to get involved. He understood the dangers faced by law enforcement officials every day. It's high time the administration found its voice and helped Virginia Democrats put an end to this reckless repeal.  Don't let our national safety be compromised. Demand action from the Obama administration today!”X>  SHOCKING NEW AGREEMENT: Obama and Hatoyama Moving U.S. Marine Base to New Location!

It's like something out of a sci-fi movie!  But not everyone is thrilled about this spine-tingling decision. The island's residents, who have been plagued by base-related noise, pollution, and crime, are absolutely devastated. Their hopes have been crushed, leaving them feeling betrayed and abandoned.

Swine Flu Panic Sparks Massive Demand for Vaccines!"  Hold onto your hats, folks, because flu season is upon us and drugstore operators are wasting no time in getting their flu shot campaigns started! This year, they're jumping the gun several weeks earlier than usual, and you won't believe the reason why. It's all thanks to the swine flu strain that has been terrorizing headlines and dominating the news. CVS Caremark Corp. and Walgreen Co. are leading the charge, making flu shots available starting Tuesday. But wait, there's more! Rite Aid Corp. is already ahead of the game, with some of its pharmacists already administering the shots.  Now, listen up, because this is important: the flu shot they're offering is specifically for preventing the seasonal flu, not the swine flu. You see, a separate swine flu vaccine is in the works and could be ready by mid-October. But for now, these drugstore giants are focusing on getting you protected from the regular flu. CVS claims they're offering the shots earlier than ever before, a solid three or four weeks ahead of schedule. Meanwhile, Walgreen got a head start last year by giving flu shots on October 1st. These retail powerhouses are no joke, folks, with CVS and Walgreen each boasting around 6,900 stores across the nation, and Rite Aid not far behind with about 4,800.  But hold your horses, because the flu shot extravaganza doesn't stop there. Walgreen is going all out by making the shots available at almost all of their stores, and get this â€“ even at about 350 of their Take Care retail clinics! CVS, on the other hand, is planning to host scheduled events in many of their stores and at all 500 of their walk-in MinuteClinics. Rite Aid is no slouch either, with pharmacists at about 1,500 of their stores ready to administer the vaccination. It's like a flu shot party, y'all!  If you're wondering when and where you can get your shot, fear not! Walgreen pharmacies and clinics will have an immunizing pharmacist on duty daily from September 8th to September 30th. And starting on September 15th, CVS is going all out by holding over 9,000 "flu shot clinic events" at their stores, where skilled pharmacists and healthcare workers will be ready to give you that all-important injection.

In a bombshell revelation, it has been suggested that the Bush administration broke the law by concealing a CIA counter-terrorism program from Congress. And even more shocking, Vice President Dick Cheney is accused of ordering the concealment! Now, Attorney General Eric Holder is contemplating opening a criminal probe into possible CIA torture. This explosive development is sure to cause a political firestorm that could distract from President Barack Obama's important healthcare and energy reform efforts.  President Obama has been reluctant to investigate alleged Bush-era abuses, rejecting the idea of a "truth commission." He has repeatedly stated that the U.S. should be "looking forward and not backwards." However, two influential senators are pushing for an investigation into the Bush administration's failure to notify Congress about the counter-terrorism program.  Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, emphasized the importance of Congress investigating the secrecy. She stated, "It could be illegal, and that's a big problem because the law is very clear." Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois echoed Feinstein's concerns, saying that Congress needs to look into the matter.  CIA director Leon Panetta revealed to Congress that Cheney ordered the program to be kept hidden. Feinstein exclaimed, "We were kept in the dark. That's something that should never, ever happen again." Even Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas agreed that the CIA should keep Congress informed but suggested that this new disclosure might be an attempt to provide political cover for Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi has accused the CIA of lying to her about waterboarding in 2002.  The truth is finally coming to light about the alleged abuses of power during the Bush administration. Will justice be served? Will Cheney and others face criminal charges? Stay tuned for more explosive updates on this shocking investigation!”X¥  SHOCKING! News Provider DELETES Story, What Are They HIDING?

  "Cricket's Triumphant Return to Pakistan: World XI Set to Defy Terrorists!"  In a bold move to end Pakistan's sporting isolation, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is planning to send an invitational World XI to play in the country. This incredible decision comes in the aftermath of a terror attack on the Sri Lankan team that left the cricket world in shock.  The ICC, determined to stand against terrorism, hopes that fixtures can be played in Pakistan by the end of 2011. However, they are currently assessing the security situation and the availability of players before finalizing the plans. The man leading this heroic mission is Giles Clarke, head of the ICC task force established in 2009 to support Pakistan in fulfilling its international cricket commitments.  "The terrorists must not win," Clarke declared with unwavering resolve in an exclusive interview with The Wisden Cricketer magazine. He acknowledged the enormous security challenges but emphasized the importance of returning cricket to the Pakistani people. "World cricket must go back and play in Pakistan," he asserted.  While it may still be too soon for a national team to return, an All Star team could serve as a more easily protected alternative. With fewer matches and venues, the safety of the players can be ensured. This is a crucial step towards reviving cricket tours of Pakistan, which were abruptly abandoned after the horrifying attack on the Sri Lankan team's bus in Lahore on March 9, 2009.  In that fateful incident, six police officers and a van driver lost their lives, and players and officials were left injured. The ICC also decided to remove Pakistan as one of the hosts for the 2011 World Cup. However, Clarke firmly believes that Pakistan's rich cricket history and passionate fans deserve to witness international matches once again.  Clarke revealed that the Pakistan Cricket Board has suffered a devastating blow, with their income dropping by two-thirds since the attack. This impact has been described as "brutal" and is a testament to the resilience of the cricket community in Pakistan.  In a scathing 120-page report, a high-ranking judge appointed by the Pakistan government heavily criticized the ill-preparedness and poor equipment of the senior police at the time of the attack. This further underscores the need for cricket to triumph over terrorism and bring back the joy and excitement of the game to the Pakistani people.  When the first ICC team finally walks out onto the field in Pakistan, it will be an historic moment. The atmosphere will be electric, and the world will witness the indomitable”XÄ  Sally Pearson's Quest for Gold Takes a Twist!

Pearson had triumphantly crossed the finish line in the 100-meter race, leaving her competitors in the dust with an impressive time of 11.28 seconds. She was on top of the world, basking in her glorious victory...until disaster struck. Pearson and Laura Turner of England were disqualified for a false start, thanks to a protest from the England team. Can you believe it? Talk about a plot twist!  In a moment of reflection, Pearson admitted that she had made a grave mistake. She confessed, "I was silly. I wasn't relaxed or focused on my own game. I didn't breathe and stay relaxed, and that's what I have to do in the hurdles final." But it seems this setback only fueled the fire within her, as she now sets her sights on the gold medal in the hurdles event.  Meanwhile, Osayomi Oludamola of Nigeria was awarded the gold medal in the 100-meter race, thanks to the disqualifications. However, her luck seems to have run out as she failed to advance in the 200-meter semifinals, finishing fourth in her heat with a time of 23.95 seconds.

Defending champions Bordeaux have made an epic comeback, reclaiming their spot at the top of the French league after trouncing Le Mans with an impressive 3-0 victory on Saturday. This win comes after Bordeaux suffered two consecutive league defeats, proving that they are true champions with an unyielding spirit. With 22 points under their belt, Bordeaux has now surpassed Monaco by a single point.  Meanwhile, Lyon, who had previously secured a triumphant victory against Liverpool in the Champions League, suffered a devastating blow, falling to a shocking 4-1 loss against struggling Nice. This marks Lyon's second consecutive league defeat, leaving them in fourth place with 20 points. It's their worst loss since their 5-2 defeat at the hands of Barcelona in last season's Champions League. Lyon may have had possession on their side, but it was Nice who dominated the scoreboard.  Nice broke the deadlock in the 17th minute when Mamadou Bagayoko outperformed Lyon defender Cris in the area and scored a magnificent header from Loic Remy's cross. Lyon tried to regain control, but Nice doubled their lead in the 39th minute when Aly Cissokho accidentally scored an own-goal. Remy delivered a low cross that deflected off a Lyon defender, leaving goalkeeper Remi Vercoutre helpless. Nice midfielder David Hellebuyck increased the lead in the 69th minute with an angled shot, and Remy sealed the deal in the 74th minute. Lyon managed to salvage some pride with a consolation goal from Ederson in the 82nd minute.  Nice, who was previously second to last in the league, has now climbed to 14th place with 11 points.

Just ask the scores of frustrated readers who have contacted the ombudsman, desperately seeking a way to report content problems on the website. Most of them didn't even know about the tiny "Help" link at the bottom of each page. Seriously, who would find that? But even if they did, it's not quick enough. When there's a mismatched photo and caption or a broken story link, time is of the essence!  Take Diana Kunkel, for example. She scoured The Post's website, desperately searching for a way to report that an outdated editorial page link. But there was no "web master" to be found. And when she was transferred to the operator, the line mysteriously went dead. Talk about frustrating!  Mary Jo Comer had a similar nightmare when she tried to notify the web staff about two stories missing from the online version of the newspaper. Why can't there be an easy way to report glitches? She has a point!  But that's not all. Readers are also up in arms about the lack of a simple system to report journalistic errors. And they're right! The website only offers a small "corrections" link buried under the "News" section. Sure, it gives you an email address to send your correction requests to, but who has time for that? Readers are better off calling The Post's main number and asking to be connected to the right desk. Or at least that's what they're told.  But here”XÔ  Exclusive: Coast Guard Adm.

  SHOCKING RULING! BAN ON CRUCIFIXES IN ITALIAN SCHOOLS SPARKS OUTRAGE!  In a jaw-dropping decision that has sent shockwaves throughout Europe, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that crucifixes in Italian public schools violate religious and education freedoms! But fear not, because nine European governments are fighting back, demanding that this outrageous ruling be overturned.   This ruling, which is part of a larger debate over the role of religious symbols in public places, has ignited a fierce battle between secular and religious advocacy groups. Italian courts have previously stated that the display of crucifixes is a crucial part of Italian national identity and is not an attempt to convert anyone. And now, New York University legal scholar Joseph Weiler is backing Italy, along with the governments of Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Malta, San Marino, Romania, and Russia, in appealing this preposterous decision.  But the consequences of this ruling go far beyond Italy, my friends. The decisions made by the European Court of Human Rights are binding on all 47 member states of the Council of Europe, which is the continent's top human rights watchdog. This means that this ban on crucifixes could potentially spread like wildfire!  Weiler argues that "the democratic cohesion of society is dependent on the ability to uphold national symbols around which all society can coalesce." It's a strange world we live in if Italy is forced to abandon their national symbols and remove any symbol that has religious significance from their cultural identity.  Crucifixes are a common sight in Italian schools and public places, but now, according to the European court, they are deemed disturbing to non-Christian or atheist pupils. The court also stressed the need for state-run schools to maintain neutrality in regards to religion, especially since attendance is compulsory.   This case has been taken very seriously, my friends. The original hearing was conducted by a seven-judge panel, but the appeal was heard by a whopping 19 judges in what they call a "grand chamber." Clearly, the tribunal recognizes the importance of this issue.  The case was brought forth by Soile Lautsi, a mother of two, who claimed that public schools in her northern Italian town refused to remove Roman Catholic symbols from the classrooms eight years ago. She argues that these crucifixes violate the secular principles that public schools should uphold, as well as her right to offer her children a secular education. She took her case to the European Court of Human Rights in 2006”XÚ	  TOP SECRET MISSION: Marines Take on Remote Afghan Enclave!  In the depths of southwestern Afghanistan lies a hidden gem that the bigwigs in Kabul would rather forget. Welcome to Delaram, a tiny village surrounded by desolate desert and home to a handful of truck stops and farms. It's so far removed from civilization that some officers even call it "the end of the Earth." But don't be fooled by its unassuming facade - the Marines see Delaram as a vital piece of the puzzle in their quest to bring economic development to this war-torn nation.  While the suits in Kabul focus on protecting the major cities, the Marines have their sights set on controlling this remote part of Nimruz province. They're building an enormous base on the outskirts of town, complete with airstrips, a combat hospital, a post office, and even its own convenience store. Housing trailers stretch as far as the eye can see, ready to accommodate over 3,000 Marines by the summer.  President Obama's deadline to start reducing troops is fast approaching, but the Marines have no intention of backing down. They're determined to do things their own way, even if it means taking risks. Brig. Gen. Lawrence Nicholson, the top Marine commander in Afghanistan, explains, "If we're going to succeed here, we have to experiment and take risks. Just doing what everyone else is doing isn't going to cut it."  The Marines are daringly venturing into Taliban strongholds that were previously ignored, setting up an incredible school to train police officers, and even bringing in a Muslim chaplain to pray with local mullahs. They've even deployed teams of female Marines to reach out to Afghan women. Their unconventional tactics have won them many fans within the military, who hail the Marine approach as a shining example of how counterinsurgency strategy should be implemented.  But not everyone is cheering them on. The higher-ups in Kabul and Washington are less than thrilled about the Marines' autonomy and their refusal to play by the rules. They've even coined the term "Marineistan" to describe the Marines' area of operations in the south. These skeptics argue that the Marines' expansion in Delaram goes against the population-centric approach favored by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan. They're desperately trying to regain control over the Marines and bring them back in line.  The tension is so high that the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, Karl Eikenberry, has even compared the Marines to a separate nation”X—	  "20th Anniversary of Bloody Tiananmen Square Massacre: Exiled Protest Leader Blocked from Confronting Chinese Officials"   In a shocking display of power, China's government has put a tight leash on any attempts to mark the 20th anniversary of the horrific crackdown on pro-democracy activists at Tiananmen Square. The iconic square was encircled by police forces, preventing any form of commemoration. Not only that, but an exiled protest leader, notorious for publicly berating one of China's top leaders two decades ago, was also barred from returning home to confront officials about the infamous "June 4 massacre."  Foreign journalists were left out in the cold, literally, as they were denied access to the sprawling square. Uniformed and undercover police officers stood guard, ensuring no one dared to challenge the government's iron fist. Even the raising of China's national flag, a daily event, was off-limits to foreign TV camera operators and photographers, thanks to the ever-strict security measures.  The government's paranoia is evident in its recent actions, shutting down popular social networking and image-sharing sites like Twitter and Flickr. In a desperate attempt to control the narrative, CNN was blacked out when airing stories about Tiananmen. Dissidents were either confined to their homes or forced out of Beijing, all part of a grand scheme to quell any online debates or organized commemorations of this tragic anniversary.  To drive home their unwavering hard-line stance, the Chinese government has taken another sinister step. Wu'er Kaixi, the second most-wanted student leader from 1989, has been denied entry into Macau, a southern Chinese territory. Wu'er, who has been living in exile since fleeing China after the crackdown, made a bold move by traveling to Macau to turn himself in to authorities, hoping to return home. However, immigration officers intercepted him, demanding he fly back to Taiwan. Resolute, Wu'er refused to back down. Detained in a small room with a lone official guarding him, he bravely announced, "I won't let them deport me."  Wu'er rose to fame in 1989, clad in pajamas, as he hunger-striked and yelled at then-premier Li Peng during a televised meeting amidst the protests. He was named the second most-wanted student leader after the crackdown, managing to escape and find refuge in Taiwan. In 2004, an attempt to return home was thwarted when he was deported from Hong Kong. Now, Wu'er”X
  President Barack Obama's Sensational Speech in Cairo: A New Beginning for America and Islam!  Good afternoon, folks! Brace yourselves for an incredible speech delivered by none other than President Barack Obama himself. He graced the timeless city of Cairo, hosted by two truly remarkable institutions. Can you believe it? For over a thousand years, al-Azhar has been a shining beacon of Islamic learning. And let's not forget about Cairo University, which has been propelling Egypt's advancement for over a century. Together, they represent the ultimate harmony between tradition and progress. Talk about impressive!  But wait, there's more! President Obama is not only honored to be in Cairo, but he's also grateful for the warm welcome from the people of Egypt. And guess what? He brought with him the goodwill of the American people and a message of peace from Muslim communities in his country. Now that's a grand gesture!  Now, let's get to the juicy part. We all know that tensions between the United States and Muslims worldwide have been off the charts lately. But did you know that these tensions have deep historical roots? That's right, folks! The relationship between Islam and the West has seen centuries of coexistence, cooperation, conflict, and even religious wars. It's like a rollercoaster ride!  But hold on tight because things get even more intense. President Obama points out that these tensions were fueled by colonialism, which denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims. And let's not forget about the Cold War when Muslim-majority countries were treated as mere pawns. How disrespectful!  And you won't believe this, but the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization left many Muslims feeling that the West was trying to dismantle their cherished traditions. Yikes! As a result, violent extremists emerged and took advantage of these tensions. Remember 9/11? Yeah, that was just the tip of the iceberg.  President Obama, however, is determined to break this vicious cycle of fear and mistrust. He's here in Cairo to seek a fresh start, a new beginning between the United States and Muslims worldwide. And you won't believe his approach â€“ it's all about mutual interest and respect. He believes that America and Islam can coexist and even share common principles. Wow, what a revelation!  But hold your horses, folks. President Obama knows that change won't happen overnight. He's well aware that this speech alone won't magically erase years of mistrust or answer all the complex questions that got us into this mess. But he's”XÁ	  SHOCKING! Government-Controlled Media in Russia: A Concert to Honor Tax Collectors and Extremism Charges Against Respected Newspaper!  In a country where the government controls the media, the unimaginable is happening. A prime-time concert is being broadcasted across Russia, paying tribute to none other than the dreaded tax collectors. Can you believe it? These tax collectors, usually seen as intimidating agents capable of ruining lives, are now being celebrated like rock stars. Famous entertainers are joking and singing alongside them, their military-style uniforms glistening with gold braid, and a song of money on their lips.  But that's not all! The media overseers are charging a respected newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, with extremism. And what was the newspaper's crime? They were simply reporting on neo-Nazi groups! Unbelievable, right? Instead of sparking a government investigation into these fascist organizations, Novaya Gazeta received a warning for promoting extremist views. If they receive one more warning, the paper can be shut down!  To understand the gravity of the situation, let's revisit a tragic incident that occurred in January 2009. Anastasia Baburova, a 25-year-old intern for Novaya Gazeta, was shot in the back of the head after writing about youthful fascist movements. She was on her way to a subway station with Stanislav Markelov, a human rights lawyer and journalist, when he too was shot and killed. The paper had recently examined neo-Nazi groups, quoting from their websites, hoping to shed light on the issue. Little did they know, they would be met with a warning against extremism instead.  Novaya Gazeta, led by editor Dmitri Muratov, is now fighting back against these unjust charges. They recently lost an appeal against the warning, but they refuse to give up. Muratov plans to appeal to Russia's Constitutional Court and even the European Court of Human Rights. "If we don't write about neo-Nazis and corruption, then what will we write about?" he rightfully asks. Certainly not another facelift of some star!  But the fight for truth and justice comes with great risks. Muratov supervises 60 journalists who are desperate to uncover the dark secrets hiding in the corners of society. However, they live under constant threat. Six journalists from Novaya Gazeta have been killed or died under mysterious circumstances. One of the most well-known cases is that of Anna Politkovskaya, a courageous war correspondent and defender of human rights. She”X	  "Shocking Resignation! President's Security Adviser to Run for Presidency!" In a surprising twist, National Security Adviser Aliyu Gusau has abruptly resigned from his powerful post, revealing his intention to become Nigeria's next president. This bombshell announcement has sent shockwaves throughout the nation, leaving citizens wondering what lies ahead in the upcoming election. According to spokesman Adekunle Adebisi, Gusau stepped down from his position on Friday, stunning the political landscape. Speculations are running wild as to why this influential figure would choose to leave his coveted role, but insiders suggest that Gusau is determined to pursue his own political ambitions. Gusau, a retired Army general, is no stranger to the political scene. He has long been a shadowy figure, pulling the strings behind Nigeria's military and security agencies. With his extensive experience as a national security adviser to Nigeria's past presidents, Gusau has undoubtedly amassed a considerable amount of knowledge and power. This is not Gusau's first flirtation with the presidency. In 2007, he bravely entered the presidential primary race, but eventually withdrew from the competition. Now, with the upcoming October primaries on the horizon, Gusau plans to throw his hat back into the ring by applying to join the ruling People's Democratic Party as a candidate. Meanwhile, President Goodluck Jonathan, who ascended to power following the tragic death of Nigeria's elected leader, has officially launched his campaign. With the sudden resignation of his trusted security adviser, Jonathan's path to re-election may face unexpected obstacles. As the Nigerian public anxiously awaits the outcome of this unprecedented political drama, one thing is certain - the race for the presidency has just taken a thrilling and unpredictable turn. Will Aliyu Gusau's bold move pay off? Only time will tell if this behind-the-scenes player can step out from the shadows and claim Nigeria's highest office.

In a jaw-dropping decision that could have major repercussions for peace talks, a British court has ordered a couple to tear down their luxurious holiday villa in northern Cyprus. This shocking ruling comes after the European Court of Justice upheld the claim of Meletis Apostolides, a Greek Cypriot whose family was forced to flee in 1974 due to the Turkish invasion.  The court has declared that Apostolides is the rightful owner of the property, which belonged to his family before the invasion. As a result, David and Linda Orams, who purchased the property in 2002, have been ordered to demolish their dream villa and abandon their claim.  Apostolides, clearly ecstatic about his victory, expressed, "I feel good but not because someone else is sad. I would like to have my property back because it is my human right." He went on to mention that the Orams were well aware of the potential legal challenges when they bought the property, so they can't play the innocent card now.  Naturally, this ruling has sent shockwaves through the thousands of other property owners, mostly Britons, who have invested in disputed land in northern Cyprus. The island, torn between Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north, has become a battleground for property disputes. Many Greek Cypriots were forced to abandon their homes during the bloody fighting, and now it seems that justice is finally being served.  But not everyone is happy about this decision. Marian Stokes, founder of the Homebuyers' Pressure Group, expressed disappointment and shock at the ruling. She believes this has given the Greek Cypriots an unfair advantage and fears it could set a dangerous precedent for other foreign property owners.  However, despite the setback, these foreign owners are not ready to give up their beloved homes. They believe they have done nothing wrong and are determined to fight for their rights. They are anxiously waiting for guidance from the Turkish Cypriot government, which is only recognized by Turkey.  This ruling has only added to the already difficult task of reaching a peaceful resolution for the divided island. The two sides are miles apart on compensation, land swaps, and other financial matters. Cyprus President Dimitris Christofias sees this ruling as a major blow to the Turkish Cypriot stance on property disputes. He hailed it as a legal and political triumph, as it upholds the laws and regulations of the European Union and the Council”X"  "Everton Sensation Mikel Arteta Commits to Five-Year Deal, Crushing Transfer Rumors!"  In a stunning turn of events, Everton midfielder Mikel Arteta has put an end to all speculation about his future by signing a lucrative five-year contract with the Premier League club. The 28-year-old Spaniard, who has been linked to moves to bigger clubs all summer, has decided to stay put and help Everton elevate their game after last season's eighth-place finish.  Arteta's decision to stick with the Toffees comes as a huge relief to fans who feared losing their star player. In a passionate statement, Arteta expressed his dedication to the club, saying, "This summer has made me realize my true value to Everton and how important this club is to me. The chairman and the manager have shown me overwhelming support, making me feel incredibly proud. We all share the same vision for the club's future, and that's something truly special."  With unwavering belief in the squad's potential, Arteta exclaimed, "Something magical is happening here, and I want to be a part of it. I am committed to helping Everton reach new heights and achieve greatness."  Arteta, who has never represented the senior Spanish national team, first joined Everton on loan from Real Sociedad six years ago. His exceptional skills and dedication to the game have earned him the title of "one of the finest players ever to wear an Everton shirt" from chairman Bill Kenwright.  In a display of unity and determination, Arteta joins four other Everton players who have recently signed new contracts. Tim Cahill, Seamus Coleman, Jack Rodwell, and Leighton Baines have all pledged their allegiance to the Liverpool club, solidifying Everton's status as a force to be reckoned with in the upcoming season.

In a bombshell report by SEC inspector general David Kotz, it has been revealed that the official at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) who would later marry Bernard Madoff's niece, regrets not digging deeper into the disgraced financier's business. Eric Swanson, an SEC attorney and inspections official during a 2003-04 exam of Madoff's operations, admitted that if he had carefully reviewed a complaint about Madoff's business, he would have conducted a more thorough investigation.  But that's not all! Swanson allegedly told a colleague in April 2004 that the inspection of Madoff's business was still ongoing, even after the exam team had stopped working on it. Talk about being negligent! Swanson later explained that an inspection could still be considered ongoing even if it was put on hold. How convenient!  Now, before you jump to conclusions, Kotz's investigation found no evidence that the relationship between Swanson and Madoff's niece, Shana, influenced the SEC exams of Madoff. Swanson even testified in the inquiry that he wasn't closely involved in the 2003-04 Madoff exam after Mark Donohue took over as assistant director of the SEC inspections division. According to Swanson, he never discussed the exam with Shana Madoff.  However, the shocking truth is that the Madoff inspection was essentially ignored, with the exam team having unresolved questions. The report, a whopping 477 pages, released on a Friday evening (because that's when all the juicy secrets come out), reveals the unbelievable details of how the SEC fumbled their investigations of Madoff for a staggering 16 years. There were disputes among agency inspection staffers, a lack of communication among SEC offices, and repeated failures to act on credible complaints. It's as if they were blind to the sea of red flags waving in their faces.  But wait, there's more! Madoff was no ordinary criminal. He apparently had a talent for intimidating and impressing examiners. He even dropped names of top officials in the agency to make himself seem more important. One examiner described him as "charismatic" and "charming," except when he was angry. Talk about a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation!  And here's a jaw-dropping revelation: In May 2006, Madoff thought he was caught. He thought the end was near. But to his amaz”•Ù     Xá	  Scandalous Suspension for Clippers Announcers!  Shockwaves are rippling through the NBA as two Los Angeles Clippers broadcasters have been slapped with a one-game suspension by the Fox Sports Prime Ticket cable network. Ralph Lawler and Michael Smith, known for their colorful commentary, landed in hot water with their off-the-cuff remarks about Iranian-born NBA player Hamed Haddadi during a recent telecast.  The outrageous banter between the dynamic duo included mentions of Borat actor Sacha Baron Cohen and managed to offend a viewer who couldn't resist complaining to Fox. Well, that complaint certainly didn't fall on deaf ears, as Lawler and Smith were promptly benched for the Clippers' game against the Denver Nuggets at Staples Center.  Stepping in to replace the suspended pair were Michael Eaves and Don MacLean, who usually serve as halftime and postgame analysts. But make no mistake, the absence of Lawler and Smith was felt by fans and viewers who have come to expect their unfiltered and sometimes controversial commentary.  Lawler, a seasoned play-by-play announcer with an impressive 31 seasons under his belt, has delivered more than 2,400 regular season and playoff Clippers broadcasts in his illustrious career. Smith, on the other hand, is in his 12th season as a color analyst for the team.  Fox Sports Prime Ticket wasted no time in issuing a statement, expressing regret over the remarks made by Lawler and Smith and acknowledging that the comments were inappropriate. The network extended their apologies to Hamed Haddadi of the Memphis Grizzlies and anyone else who may have been offended. They assured the public that the situation had been addressed and appropriate action had been taken against the broadcasters.  As for the Clippers, they remained tight-lipped about the whole scandal, choosing not to comment on the matter. However, the Los Angeles Times managed to get its hands on a transcript of the conversation between Lawler and Smith that caused all the trouble. Brace yourselves, folks, because it's quite a doozy.  In the transcript, Smith is heard referring to Hamed Haddadi as "the first Iranian to play in the NBA." However, it was Smith's pronunciation of the word "Iranian" as "Eye-ranian" that seemed to ruffle feathers. Lawler then chimed in, repeating the mispronunciation and expressing disbelief at the notion of an Iranian player in the NBA.  The conversation took a bizarre turn when Lawler questioned whether Haddadi was truly from Iran, to which Smith confirmed. Lawler's”Xl
  "Stocks Soar as U.S. Manufacturing Mirrors China's Expansion! Federal Reserve Set to Announce New Economic Stimulus Program!"   Traders were filled with hope on Monday as stocks began to rise, anticipating a report on manufacturing activity in the U.S. that would mimic the recent expansion in China. The excitement in the market was further fueled by the approaching midterm elections and the Federal Reserve's meeting later in the week, where an announcement of a new economic stimulus program was expected.  The Dow Jones industrial average shot up nearly 50 points in early morning trading, setting the stage for an exciting day on Wall Street. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters predicted a slight dip in the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for October, but any reading above 50 indicated growth in the sector. Manufacturing has remained a consistent source of growth throughout the year, despite the overall sluggish recovery.  Meanwhile, China's manufacturing sector experienced a significant boost, causing shares in the country to skyrocket. Increased spending on infrastructure led to a surge in orders for new equipment, driving growth in the Chinese economy. The Dow responded positively to this news, rising 47.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,165.71 in early morning trading. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite index also experienced gains, rising 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and the Shanghai Composite Index saw even more impressive increases, rising 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. However, experts caution that this surge in response to the manufacturing report could be short-lived, as traders eagerly await the outcome of Tuesday's midterm elections and the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Wednesday.  Traders have been eagerly betting on Republicans taking control of the House of Representatives, which could put a damper on President Barack Obama's agenda that many analysts believe is unfavorable to businesses. Additionally, investors have been assuming that the Federal Reserve will launch a new Treasury-buying program to stimulate the economy. This expectation has driven the stock market rally throughout October, with the Dow rising 3.1 percent overall. However, in the last few days, the rally has slowed down as questions arise about the extent of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying plans.

In a devastating turn of events, Liesel Augis, the fearless South African girl who miraculously survived a heinous criminal assault that rocked the entire nation, has tragically lost her life in a heart-wrenching school van accident. The six-year-old girl, known as 'Little Rock' for her incredible strength and resilience, was among the victims when a train collided with the ill-fated van earlier this week. The incident left the nation in utter shock and disbelief.  According to a family spokesperson, Liesel's journey has been one filled with both triumph and tragedy. In 2006, she endured a horrifying ordeal when a so-called "family friend" brutally raped her, mercilessly beat her unconscious with a brick, and even callously threw her into a fire. Miraculously, she survived, becoming a symbol of strength against all odds.  However, fate had other plans for this brave little girl. On that fateful Wednesday, the bus driver, in a reckless act of negligence, bypassed a closed railroad crossing gate, leading to the devastating collision with the train. The impact claimed the lives of nine innocent children at the scene in Cape Town, with another precious life lost on Friday. Only the driver and four children managed to survive this horrific tragedy.  Through tears, the family spokesperson, Malvern de Bruyn, expressed the deep pain and indelible scar left by this unimaginable accident. "Liesel had an incredible zest for life, and this accident has shattered not only our family but the entire nation," de Bruyn lamented. The loss of Liesel, who had defied the odds time and time again, has left a void that can never truly be filled.  The nightmare that began in 2006 with the vile attack on Liesel by Abraham James was just one of several atrocities committed between 2000 and 2006 in an area now infamously referred to as the 'Bushes of Devil.' James, the heartless perpetrator, was justly sentenced to 28 years in prison without parole for his abhorrent actions. However, the family's suffering did not end there.  Within days of James' arrest, their home became the target of unknown arsonists who attempted to set it ablaze. De Bruyn, desperate to protect his loved ones, had to find them refuge in the same area. Despite the immense challenges they faced, Liesel bravely started attending Good Hope Primary”XÝ  Portugal's Debt Crisis: Borrowing Costs Skyrocket!  Hold on to your hats, folks, because Portugal's debt levels are causing some serious drama! The country's borrowing costs have reached their highest level since the adoption of the euro, and nobody knows if the government can handle it. Yikes!  Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, the interest rates on Portuguese 10-year bonds went through the roof! They jumped from 6.05 percent to a staggering 6.5 percent in just one day. Talk about a rollercoaster ride!  And get this, folks - this all happened right before a planned bond issue to raise up to (EURO)1 billion. It's like Portugal's finances are playing a cruel joke on them. Will they be able to raise the funds they need? Only time will tell!  But wait, there's more! The center-left Socialist government is working on next year's state budget, promising to cut the budget deficit down to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product. They're talking big, but can they deliver? We'll have to wait and see.  The government claims their austerity plan will reduce the budget deficit to 7.3 percent this year, down from a whopping 9.3 percent in 2009. It sounds good in theory, but can they make it happen? The suspense is killing us!  Portugal's debt crisis is like a never-ending soap opera, filled with twists and turns. Will they be able to overcome these borrowing costs? Will their austerity plan actually work? Stay tuned, folks, because this is one story you won't want to miss!”XŽ  PANASONIC'S 3-D TVS FLY OFF SHELVES IN USA!  Panasonic is riding high on the success of their 3-D TVs, which sold out in the United States in just one week! This incredible news has sparked hope that the same technology that made "Avatar" a record-breaking hit will now revolutionize living rooms and send profits soaring. The shortage of these mind-blowing TVs has led the world's biggest plasma TV maker to start taking back-orders from retailers, according to Hitoshi Otsuki, the senior managing director at Panasonic. He didn't give specific figures, but it's safe to say that demand is off the charts!  "It's a golden opportunity to turn our TV business around," Otsuki gushed. The TV industry is betting big on movies like "Avatar," the highest-grossing film of all time, and sports events like the 2010 FIFA World Cup to drive demand for these cutting-edge 3-D sets. They've come a long way with improved technology, but there are still hurdles to overcome. For one, there's a lack of 3-D programming available, and viewers need to wear special eyewear. These were the stumbling blocks that held back earlier attempts to convince consumers to embrace 3-D TVs.   However, there are always those who can't resist the allure of high-end products, according to Kazuharu Miura, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets in Tokyo. And Panasonic is cashing in on that desire, becoming the first major TV maker to release 3-D sets in the U.S. Their 50-inch full high-definition plasma TV hit Best Buy shelves on March 10, priced at $2,899.99 with a pair of glasses and a 3-D Blu-ray player. Not to be outdone, Samsung Electronics, the biggest TV maker in the world, unveiled a 55-inch 3-D model on March 14 for $3,299.99. Sony is also jumping on the 3-D bandwagon, planning to start selling 3-D Bravia TVs in June.  Panasonic's TV division suffered a loss of over $111 million in the last quarter, but President Fumio Ohtsubo believes that the business will turn a profit by March 2011. They're counting on 3-D broadcasts of major sporting events to drive sales. FIFA has already announced that they will deliver 3-D images from up to 25 matches of this year's soccer World Cup in South”Xƒ	  Obama and Boehner: Unlikely Duo or Political Showdown?  President Barack Obama, the Democrat, and incoming House Speaker John Boehner, the Republican, are about to embark on a wild political ride together. This odd couple must navigate the treacherous waters of Washington, D.C. as they push their own agendas and prepare for the 2012 elections. The stakes are high, with Obama's re-election, the Republicans' newfound power, and the country's economic stability hanging in the balance.  But with the dust still settling after the election, it's clear that Obama is the one on the defensive. Democrats are calling for compromise, while the Republicans are putting conditions on any potential meeting in the middle. Come January, Boehner will have more influence in Washington and control over the domestic agenda. Obama, on the other hand, must find a way to reboot his presidency, whether that means altering his goals, improving his communication skills, or both.  The first glimpses of how these two leaders will position themselves in this political showdown came on Wednesday. Obama, weakened by the election results, called for common ground and progress. He acknowledged that no one party can dictate the future, but still faced opposition from Boehner, who labeled Obama's health care overhaul a "monstrosity" and demanded its repeal.  Democrats, their ranks diminished, chimed in with calls for a new approach to working together. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, fresh off his own re-election victory, expressed his desire to build a consensus and move the country forward. He called on the Republican Party to be more open to compromise and criticized their habit of simply saying "no."  Despite the calls for unity, there are sure to be fights ahead. Reid made it clear that he won't support any move to repeal the health care measure, although he admitted it could use some tweaking. The stage is set for a high-profile gathering between Obama and the new Republican leadership, but it remains to be seen if they can find common ground.  In this two-person, two-party town, it's clear that Obama and Boehner need each other. They must find areas of compromise to appease the unhappy electorate and lay the groundwork for the 2012 elections. However, they also need to use each other to fire up their respective bases. The clock is ticking, and failure is not an option. The fate of the nation rests on their shoulders.”X¡	  SHOCKING NEWS: Obama Administration to Continue Indefinite Detention Policy!  In a surprising twist, the Obama administration has revealed its plans to codify the controversial Bush-era policy of indefinite detention for suspected terrorists. But don't be fooled, folks - this is both terrible and a slight improvement! Rather than completely abandoning indefinite detention, President Obama is simply trying to make the process fairer. How noble!  According to reports, the forthcoming proposal will enhance the Bush administration's detention review process by making it more adversarial. Detainees will now have the luxury of being represented by a lawyer, and the review boards will consist of more than just military officials. It's like a "parole board" for suspected terrorists, as The New York Times describes it. How quaint!  But here's the twist, folks - it's not clear if these detainees are actually "battlefield captures" or if they're being held indefinitely to hide the fact that they should either be charged with a crime or released. Complicating matters is the fact that the fight against al-Qaida has no end in sight. Brace yourselves, because this could mean that indefinite detention will become a permanent fixture of U.S. law!  The administration might argue that using an executive order is a smart move, as it avoids the constraints on detainee rights that a Republican Congress would impose. Sneaky, huh? But let's not forget, an executive order can easily be undone by the next administration. So, don't get too comfortable, folks!  Now, here's the million-dollar question: will this proposal only apply to the "legacy cases" at Guantanamo, or will it also affect future cases? We're left in suspense, wondering what the Obama administration has up its sleeve.  While indefinite detention becomes an official part of Obama's national security policy, there is a glimmer of hope for those detainees who have lost their habeas cases and are stuck in limbo. Hooray for small victories!  But let's be real, folks - this proposal is just another example of the Obama administration's approach to security and civil liberties. Remember when Obama promised to reverse the Bush-era policies? Well, he's settled for making them marginally more lawful and humane. It's not what we were promised, and certainly not what the left had hoped for. Disappointing, to say the least.

Loan Losses and Recession Provisions Send BBVA's Net Profit Down a Whopping 94%!"  In a shocking turn of events, Spain's second-largest bank, BBVA, reported a jaw-dropping 94% drop in its fourth-quarter net profit. This disastrous outcome, totaling a mere (EURO)31 million ($44 million), can be attributed to the devastating loan losses and other provisions directly linked to the crippling recession.  But wait, there's more! Unbelievably, if we exclude the one-off costs, which reached a mind-boggling (EURO)1.05 billion ($1.48 billion), BBVA's profit would have hit (EURO)1.08 billion. This is a figure comparable to the same period in 2008. It's as if they had a glimmer of hope, only to be ruthlessly snuffed out by the harsh reality of the economic downturn.  Although the bank managed to show a sliver of improvement in its fourth-quarter gross income, with a 15% rise to (EURO)5.3 billion, it simply couldn't compensate for the colossal blow to its profits. The year 2009, as a whole, witnessed a 16% decline in BBVA's profits, reaching a measly (EURO)4.2 billion.   The disastrous news sent shockwaves through the market, causing BBVA shares to plummet a whopping 5% to (EURO)11.43 in early trading. It seems investors were not amused by the bank's dismal performance and were quick to react, fleeing from the sinking ship.  The future looks uncertain for BBVA as it battles the harsh economic climate and struggles to recover from this devastating blow. Can this once mighty Spanish bank regain its former glory, or is it doomed to be just another casualty of the recession? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for more shocking updates on BBVA's rollercoaster ride to financial redemption!”X÷  "TRAGEDY STRIKES! 'I Spy' Star Robert Culp Dies After Shocking Fall Near His Home at 79!"  Heartbreaking news has hit Hollywood as the dashing Robert Culp, renowned for his roles in the hit TV series 'I Spy' and the hilarious film 'Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,' tragically passed away on March 24. The 79-year-old actor suffered a fatal fall near his Los Angeles home, leaving fans devastated.  Although Culp made sporadic appearances on Broadway and in movies, it was his captivating presence on television that made him a household name. With his tall stature, lithe figure, and impeccably combed black hair, he effortlessly charmed audiences and showcased his wit. Over the years, Culp's on-screen persona evolved into an endearing grumpiness, delighting viewers on shows like 'The Greatest American Hero' and 'Everybody Loves Raymond.'  Starting in the 1950s, Culp made his mark on Broadway and early TV anthology series, but it was his transition to Hollywood that truly showcased his versatility. He stole the spotlight with his supporting role as Ensign George 'Barney' Ross in 'PT 109' (1963) and charmed audiences in the romantic comedy 'Sunday in New York' (1963) alongside the talented Jane Fonda. Culp's portrayal of the legendary Old West gunfighter 'Wild Bill' Hickok in 'The Raiders' (1964) further solidified his status as a force to be reckoned with.  As the years went by, Culp's distinguished appearance and debonair style opened doors for him to portray various elected officials in films like 'Turk 182!' (1985) and 'The Pelican Brief' (1993). His aged good looks added a touch of gravitas to his characters, making him a standout on the silver screen.  However, Culp's greatest triumph was his iconic role in the groundbreaking TV series 'I Spy,' which aired from 1965 to 1968. Television historian Robert Thompson hailed it as one of the 'hippest TV shows to have ever aired.' The espionage adventure shattered barriers by casting the then-unknown nightclub comedian Bill Cosby, making it one of the first shows to feature a black male actor in a leading dramatic role. With its dry humor and thrilling intrigue, 'I Spy' captured the hearts of viewers, earning Culp several Emmy Award nominations for his portrayal of American spy Kelly Robinson.  Cosby, who played Robinson”Xõ  "Lottery Ticket" - A Weekend from Hell!

Picture this: Kevin is just one workday away from claiming a life-changing $370 million jackpot. But standing in his way are the colorful characters of his housing project, including a gold digger, a muscle-bound ex-con, and a bunch of sketchy friends. Can you imagine the chaos that can be unleashed in just three days? We're talking about a rollercoaster of emotions!  Now, most people in Kevin's position would probably lay low, maybe hide out in a friend's closet. But not our boy Kevin! He spills the beans about his newfound wealth to the whole neighborhood. And if that's not enough, he even takes money from a loan shark in a dark warehouse filled with luxury cars. Talk about a death wish!  But you know what really takes the cake? Kevin gets involved with a gold digger who wants to be his "baby mama." And let's just say, her body is far from ordinary. It's like she's a walking, partially disrobed brick house! Disgusting, right? We couldn't agree more.  Despite the questionable choices, there are a few shining moments in this whirlwind of a film. Bow Wow surprises us all with his impeccable comedic timing, especially when he's being seduced under a mirrored ceiling.

We certainly didn't!  But let's be real, things start to drag when the movie tries to dabble in drama. We've got an old man living in a cellar (played by Ice Cube) reminiscing about his boxing days, accompanied by soaring music. It's like he's screaming, "This is foreshadowing, people!" And when Kevin gets into a fight with his best friend, it's so over-the-top that it screams Oscar clip territory. We're talking Frodo”X‡  Shocking!

  Shocking Move: Israel Grants Palestinian Forces Autonomy in West Bank Cities!  In a stunning turn of events, Israel has caved to pressure from Washington and given U.S.-trained Palestinian security forces more power in four major West Bank cities. This decision is crucial for Middle East peace negotiations, as Israel needs assurance that a future Palestinian state won't pose a threat to its security.  Previously, Israel had handed over security control to Palestinians in three other West Bank cities. But now, the Israeli army plans to reduce its presence in four additional population centers: Qalqiliya, Bethlehem, Jericho, and Ramallah. While this may not be a complete withdrawal, it's a significant step towards Palestinian autonomy.  The most exciting part? Israeli officials have agreed to ease their strict requirements for coordination between Palestinian security forces and the Israeli military. This means that Palestinians will have more freedom to decide where to deploy, as well as how and when they should be armed and uniformed.  But don't get too excited just yet. Israeli troops can still enter these cities whenever they please and maintain control of roads outside the towns. It's a small victory for the Palestinians, but there's still a long way to go.  The dispute over West Bank cities dates back to the 1990s when Israel initially pulled out but later re-entered due to the Palestinian uprising. Palestinians have been demanding an Israeli withdrawal as a sign of sovereignty, and now it seems they're one step closer to achieving that goal.  This development is part of a broader effort by the U.S. to train Palestinian forces in preparation for future statehood. Israel acknowledges the improvement in the Palestinian force, especially in towns like Jenin, which was once a militant stronghold but is now a shining example of their progress.  Adnan Dmeiri, a spokesperson for the Palestinian security forces, boldly declared, "We are doing our job protecting our people, and there is no need for Israeli forces to enter our territories under the pretext of security needs."  Interestingly, this move comes as Israel has also started removing some of the hundreds of roadblocks that have hindered Palestinian movement. While Israel claims these checkpoints are necessary for security, they have supposedly committed to making life easier for Palestinians. Could this be a sign of genuine progress?  However, Israel remains cautious about a complete handover to Palestinian security. During the previous Palestinian uprising, some forces turned against Israeli targets, and President Mahmoud Abbas's police were unable to defend against Hamas militants in Gaza in 2007. With Gaza still under Hamas control, Israel”X´	  TRAGEDY STRIKES NEAR THE TAJ MAHAL! Passenger Train CRASH Leaves 22 DEAD and 16 TRAPPED for HOURS!  In a horrifying incident near Agra, the home of the majestic Taj Mahal, a passenger train collided with another train's rear carriage reserved for women and disabled passengers. The result? Absolute devastation!  With a shocking death toll of 22 people and 16 poor souls trapped for hours, this heart-wrenching tragedy unfolded on Wednesday. The victims were left helpless as rescuers battled the clock to free them from the wreckage. It took the heroic efforts of these brave individuals to finally cut open the mangled compartment and release those trapped inside.  During the nearly seven-hour operation, rescuers managed to recover 19 lifeless bodies. However, the despair continued as three of the injured victims succumbed to their injuries at the hospital. It's a gut-wrenching reality that no foreigners were among the victims, according to police.  The wreckage was none other than the coach reserved for women and physically handicapped passengers. District Magistrate Suresh Chandra Sharma revealed that although this coach catered primarily to these individuals, it's possible that others also fell victim to this tragic incident.  Both trains were en route to New Delhi from southern India when disaster struck. The Mewar Express had come to a halt at a red signal, only to be ruthlessly rammed from behind by the other train. The impact was so intense that passengers were thrown from their upper berths, crashing onto the coach floor.  Thankfully, the valiant efforts of nearby villagers and army soldiers provided some solace in the midst of this nightmare. They joined forces with the police and rail officials to rescue the injured. However, the question of why this accident occurred still looms over everyone's heads.  Rail official Sri Prakash expressed the need to determine the cause behind this tragedy, as accidents are far too common on India's vast rail network. It's a stark reminder of the country's need for better maintenance to ensure the safety of its passengers.  In the face of this heartbreak, we can only hope that authorities take the necessary steps to prevent such calamities in the future. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this incredibly difficult time.  Stay tuned for more updates on this devastating incident.  (Note: Associated Press Writer Biswajeet Banerjee in Lucknow contributed to this report.)”XÊ  Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina, the Republican nominees for governor and senator in California, have emerged victorious in their primaries. But their success may be short-lived, as California Republican primaries have a knack for producing unelectable candidates. To win, Whitman and Fiorina had to adopt extreme right-wing positions that may not resonate with the majority of Californians, who strongly support Barack Obama. Fiorina even went so far as to defend the right of suspected terrorists to purchase guns, a stance that Sen. Barbara Boxer swiftly countered by highlighting her own support for arming pilots. However, the most damaging issue for Whitman and Fiorina is immigration. Both candidates felt pressured to endorse Arizona's controversial immigration law, but this may alienate California's growing Latino electorate. The implementation of Proposition 187 in 1994, championed by former Governor Pete Wilson, led to a surge in Latino naturalization, voter registration, and Democratic voter turnout. As a result, the California electorate has shifted heavily towards the Democratic Party. With immigration being a prominent issue, it's clear that the Latino vote in California will heavily favor the Democrats.”Xƒ	  NBA Commissioner Suspends Gilbert Arenas for Guns and Games!  In a shocking turn of events, NBA Commissioner David Stern has dropped the hammer on Gilbert Arenas, suspending him from the Washington Wizards indefinitely and without pay. This bombshell decision comes after Stern initially wanted to wait for the criminal investigation surrounding a locker-room dispute involving guns and a teammate. But it seems like Stern has had a change of heart.  In a statement on the NBA website, Stern declared that Arenas' "ongoing conduct has led me to conclude that he is not currently fit to take the court in an NBA game." And what exactly was this conduct that pushed Stern over the edge? Well, it turns out a photo surfaced on The Post's Sports front Wednesday, capturing Arenas pretending to shoot his teammates with a big smile on his face. Talk about poor taste!  I mean, seriously, who does Arenas think he is? A gangster in a Hollywood movie? It's absolutely disgusting to see these grown men, who are supposed to be role models, making light of shooting another human being. It makes you wonder what Abe Pollin, the late owner of the Wizards, would have thought about this madness.  You see, Pollin was deeply disturbed by the senseless gun violence plaguing our society. So much so that in the late 90s, he decided to change the name of the team from the Bullets to the Wizards. He couldn't bear to promote a team associated with killing, violence, and death while innocent lives were being lost. Pollin even took a stand after the tragic death of his friend, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated by a gun-wielding lunatic.  But here we have Arenas, blatantly flouting the law and league regulations by bringing firearms into the Verizon Center. And to make matters worse, he involved his young children in an attempt to cover up his dangerous behavior. How reckless can one person be? Using guns to play a joke on a friend is not a laughing matter. It's downright despicable.  Thankfully, a grand jury is investigating Arenas' actions. Let's hope they send a message loud and clear that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated. Guns are not status symbols, and violence should never be glorified.  We should all strive to live up to Abe Pollin's example. He knew that principles were more important than tradition or pleasing fans. So let's show Arenas and the Wizards, and the world, that we won't stand”X²  "Step into a Time Machine: 'Boardwalk Empire' Takes Viewers on a Lavish Journey to 1920s Atlantic City!"

And let me tell you, folks, they spared no expense - it's like they plucked a group of actors and sets right out of the past, down to the very last gauzy, color-rich detail.

But can he actually follow through? As he enters his second term, Karzai faces a Taliban insurgency and rampant corruption that has left Afghans resentful towards his administration and the Western powers that have backed him for years. The West is growing increasingly frustrated as well, questioning why their troops are sacrificing their lives for a government that is corrupt and ineffective. These concerns are at the center of the debate within the Obama administration, which is considering sending more troops to Afghanistan. Karzai, dressed in his traditional green-striped robe, read his speech from a script, a stark contrast to his usually relaxed and off-the-cuff style. The atmosphere was far from the excitement of his first inauguration in 2004, when hopes were high for Afghanistan's future. The ceremony was attended by Afghanistan's elite, with men in turbans sitting alongside those in suits and women with sequined scarves covering their heads. Everyone listened closely for the promises of crucial reforms. And Karzai delivered - at least in words. "We have to learn from the mistakes of the past eight years," he declared. "We must respond to the aspirations and expectations of our people." Western criticism leading up to the inauguration had been harsh and public, particularly after a fraud-ridden election that took months to produce a result. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who dined with Karzai the night before the ceremony, warned that U.S. support would dry up without reforms. After the ceremony, Clinton commended Karzai's plans to fight corruption but emphasized that his actions would be closely watched. Karzai announced that a law would be passed requiring senior government officials to register their assets, and government employees involved in drug trafficking would be dismissed and prosecuted. Clinton acknowledged that these efforts would not be easy.”X  "Wall Street Rebounds as Stocks Surge in Early Trading!

Meanwhile, the Bulls suffered a devastating blow as they faced their first loss of the season against the Auckland Blues, with a final score of 32-17.  The Waratahs wasted no time asserting their dominance, taking an early lead of 23-3 by halftime. In the 26th minute, Rob Horne capitalized on a brilliant break by his partner Berrick Barnes, scoring a crucial try. Prop Benn Robinson added to the scoreboard after the halftime siren had sounded, leaving the Cheetahs in shambles.  Flyhalf Daniel Halangahu showcased his impeccable skills by successfully converting both tries, in addition to landing penalty goals in the ninth, 18th, and 37th minutes. This flawless performance in the opening half solidified the Waratahs' position as a formidable opponent.  Celebrations were in order as front-rower Al Baxter marked his 100th Super match with his first try for the Waratahs. Baxter, Australia's esteemed prop with 69 test appearances, crossed the line in the 44th minute, securing a bonus point for his team. While he relished the joy of scoring, Baxter remained grounded, emphasizing that his primary duty lies in the set piece and hard yards around the field.  The Waratahs continued their relentless assault, with replacement halfback Josh Holmes adding another try in the 78th minute. This final blow was expertly converted by the remarkable Berrick Barnes, sealing the Waratahs' triumphant victory.  The Cheetahs, although outmatched, managed to salvage some pride with two late consolation tries from prop W.P. Nel and reserve Corne Uys. Center Meyer Bosman converted both, adding to a first-half penalty goal by flyhalf Naas Olivier. Cheetahs coach Naka Drotske couldn't help but be impressed by the Waratahs' performance, acknowledging their ability to win close games and their impenetrable defense”Xž	  SHOCKING DRUG LORD CAPTURED IN DRAMATIC RAID!  In a heart-pounding operation reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster, federal troops launched a daring assault on a luxurious beachfront villa, apprehending one of Mexico's most ruthless kingpins. This is the second high-profile drug lord takedown in less than a month, proving that Mexico is finally fighting back against its powerful traffickers. And guess who's lending a hand? The United States, of course!  Teodoro Garcia Simental, infamously known as 'El Teo,' was busted before sunrise near the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. For over five months, American anti-drug officials had been working tirelessly alongside Mexican authorities to track down this dangerous criminal. Garcia and his gang were using his seaside hideaway to smuggle loads of drugs across the U.S. border, but thanks to enhanced electronic surveillance techniques, their reign of terror has come to an abrupt end.  Garcia, a man in his mid-30s, is responsible for the deaths of at least 300 people, authorities reveal. But it's the brutal, savage ways in which he disposed of his rivals that truly send shivers down the spine. Beheadings, hanging bodies from bridges, dissolving them in caustic soda - he stopped at nothing to instill fear in the hearts of his enemies. And let's not forget the dozens of Tijuana police officers who fell victim to his merciless assassinations.  Word on the street is that Garcia had recently made it his mission to eliminate Baja California's attorney general and Tijuana's public safety chief. His thirst for power knew no bounds, and he would stop at nothing to eradicate those standing in his way.  This astonishing arrest marks a significant turning point in Mexico's ongoing war against drug cartels. When President Felipe Calderon took office in 2006, he unleashed an army of troops to combat these criminal organizations. Unfortunately, success was few and far between, leaving the Mexican people disillusioned and frustrated with the soaring death toll that has now surpassed 15,000.  But hold onto your hats, folks, because the tides are turning! Just last month, Arturo Beltran Leyva, another notorious drug lord, met his demise in a thrilling raid executed by Mexican marines. And guess who was lending a helping hand once again? Our very own U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials, that's who! They played a crucial role in tracking down Beltran Leyva, and the results”X•  SHOCKING STOCKS SELLING BELOW BOOK VALUE!  In a shocking turn of events, fear has taken over the minds of most investors, causing stocks to plummet. But amidst the chaos, there are some hidden gems that are selling below book value. It's time to uncover the truth!  Out of the 1,500 U.S. stocks with a market value of $1 billion or more, a staggering 117 were selling below book value just last week. And guess what? Loews and WellPoint are two of the juiciest picks out there. But that's not all - smaller companies like Bristow Group and Radian Group are also catching our attention.   Book value, my friends, is the ultimate measure of a company's worth. It's the company's assets minus its liabilities. And the price-to-book ratio? That's the ratio of a stock's price to the company's book value per share. Usually, we look for ratios below two, but today we have a bounty of candidates below 1.5, and even some below one!  Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Loews, oh boy, this is a good one. It's currently languishing at 0.8 times book value and eight times earnings. This New York-based company, controlled by the Tisch family, has been a force to be reckoned with over the years. They've had stakes in media, tobacco, and energy companies, among others. And now, their two main subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corp. and Diamond Offshore Drilling, are the talk of the town. Loews owns a whopping 90 percent of CNA and 50.4 percent of Diamond Offshore. Diamond had an astounding 39 percent return on equity last year, while CNA struggled with a mere 4 percent. But don't fret, CNA is expected to bounce back with earnings increases this year and next. And for those morally inclined, don't worry, Loews spun off Lorillard in 2008. But watch out, there's still a chance they could be liable in tobacco lawsuits - scandalous!  Now, let's move on to the largest health insurer in the nation - WellPoint. Based in Indianapolis, this company operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in over a dozen states. But wait, is WellPoint being harmed by the new health-care law? You bet! Those new requirements to cover people with pre-existing conditions are causing quite the stir. But when a stock is”Xt
  "Goldman Sachs Faces Criminal Prosecution: Scandal Engulfs Wall Street Giant!"  In a shocking turn of events, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has handed over its investigation of Goldman Sachs to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. This bombshell comes just days after the SEC filed a civil securities fraud case against the firm. Our insider source, who wishes to remain anonymous, spilled the beans on this sensational story.  According to our source, the Justice Department is only in the preliminary stages of their probe. So far, no employees involved in the mortgage-related transactions at the center of the SEC case have been interviewed by the Justice Department prosecutors or the FBI agents who often conduct these investigations. The secrecy surrounding this case is intense, with our sources speaking only on the condition of anonymity.  Usually, the Justice Department investigates high-profile cases of securities fraud, but the threshold for criminal prosecution is much higher than that for civil cases. The SEC can only file civil cases, while the Justice Department has the power to bring criminal charges. It's a whole new ball game!  Late-breaking news from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News reveals that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan has heeded the SEC's request and opened a criminal probe. When contacted for comment, the office remained tight-lipped, leaving us hungry for more details.  Goldman Sachs spokesman, Lucas Van Praag, responded to the reports, stating, "Given the recent focus on the firm, we're not surprised by the report of an inquiry. We would cooperate fully with any request for information." Will the walls come tumbling down on this powerful financial institution? Only time will tell!  If the government decides to indict Goldman Sachs, it would be a rare and catastrophic blow to the company. The mere threat of criminal prosecution has the potential to destroy a firm, as we've seen in the past. Remember Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street firm that was brought down by a criminal investigation in the 1980s? And let's not forget accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which collapsed after facing criminal charges in connection with the Enron corporate corruption scandal. These cases serve as a sobering reminder of the devastating consequences that criminal charges can have on a company.  The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre, broke the law and committed fraud when they sold clients a complex investment linked to the value of home loans that was designed to fail in secret. Another player in this sordid tale is Paulson & Co., a hedge fund”XÕ	  "SHOCKING ABDUCTION: Irish Missionary Snatched By Gunmen in the Philippines!"  In a terrifying incident that unfolded in the dangerous south of the Philippines, a 78-year-old Irish missionary, Rev. Michael Sinnott, was forcefully taken by heavily armed men right from the garden of his residence. The shocking abduction occurred late Sunday evening, leaving his horrified aides at the Columban House compound in Pagadian city, Zamboanga del Sur province, completely helpless.  Regional police commander Angelo Sunglao revealed, "They could not do anything because the abductors had powerful weapons." The Associated Press was informed that six gunmen dragged Rev. Sinnott into a van right in front of his colleagues, leaving them in shock and disbelief.  While no group has claimed responsibility for this appalling act, suspicions have arisen around Muslim guerrillas who have been fighting for a separate homeland in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation's south for ages. In the past, these rebels have kidnapped foreigners, particularly priests, raising concerns about Rev. Sinnott's safety.  According to eyewitnesses, the abductors fled with Sinnott on a motorboat towards the town of Tukuran, leaving behind an abandoned and burnt van near the Catholic mission house. In response to this distressing situation, the Philippine troops and police have been mobilized, launching an extensive search operation in the area.  Maj. Ramon David Hontiveros, military spokesman, confirmed the involvement of notorious groups like the al-Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf militants and insurgents from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the vast Zamboanga peninsula. However, it is too early to definitively identify the abductors.  The Missionary Society of St. Columban, the group to which Rev. Sinnott belongs, has confirmed the abduction and is now seeking prayers for his safe recovery. Patrick O'Donoghue, the Columban regional director, expressed deep concern due to Sinnott's heart condition, especially since he was not carrying his medication at the time of the incident.  Rev. Sinnott has dedicated decades to his work in the Philippines. He first served in the southern region between 1957 and 1966 before returning in 1976. Since 1998, he has been actively involved in a school for handicapped children.  This distressing incident is not the first of its kind in the region. Several priests have previously been kidnapped, including Italian priest Giancarlo Bossi, who was held captive for 39 days in June 2007. The”Xd
  HISTORY MADE IN COMPTON!  A small group of passionate parents in Compton, Calif. have just made history! Their kids attend McKinley Elementary School - a school that's been failing for a whole decade. But these parents, armed with a new power called the 'parent trigger,' fought for and approved by state legislators last year, have demanded change.  This groundbreaking legislation allows parents of students at struggling schools to demand major reforms like shutting down a school, replacing its management or most of its staff, or turning it into a charter school. All they need is 51 percent of parents to sign a petition. And guess what? McKinley Elementary is now being transformed into a charter school run by Celerity Educational Group, which has a proven track record of success with three other schools in California.  This action has been dubbed 'the shot heard across the country,' and it's not just idle talk. Let's put things into perspective - the heartbreaking tales exposed in this year's documentary 'Waiting for Superman' shed light on the massive failure of our public education system. Without the parent trigger legislation, parents whose kids are stuck in what the film calls 'dropout factories' have only one way out - winning a lottery to get their child into a high-performing charter school. But for countless families nationwide, this is just an unanswered prayer. They're left with the harsh reality that their child will forever be trapped in a failing system. It's like the exit doors are chained shut, leaving these low-income families and their kids doomed to a life of unrealized potential. This is nothing short of the shattering of the American dream, especially in California.  But now, for the first time ever in California, underserved parents have some power and a real choice. The reforms signed in January give parents significant options to change their child's school and the freedom to leave failing schools or transfer to a different one, even in a new district. Schools become eligible for the 51 percent trigger if they've shown zero progress according to state standards for three consecutive years.  Of course, the leaders of the State Teachers Union are not happy about this and have threatened to take legal action to stop parents from using their newfound power. But let me tell you, I believe that if they try to stand in the way of the public's demand, the courts will ultimately uphold this crucial bipartisan legislation.  Don't get it twisted though - changes like replacing a school's principal and staff don't happen unless there have been years and years of failure and a majority of parents coming”XY
  SHADY BACKROOM DEALS: FCC Chairman Negotiates with Web Giants for Control Over Internet Access  In a desperate bid to gain control over consumer access to the Internet, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski has resorted to secret negotiations with a select group of the biggest Web firms and network service providers. Sources reveal that Genachowski wants these companies to put aside their differences and agree on legislation that he can present to Congress. But critics argue that Genachowski's clandestine meetings with Google, AT&T, Verizon, and Skype could lead to a future where these businesses have an unfair advantage in how consumers access the Web.  The stakes are high as these firms and the FCC discuss net neutrality provisions, which aim to prevent Internet providers from blocking or slowing down access to certain websites. This means that the talks could determine whether Verizon can offer YouTube better resolution than Netflix, or if Google and Skype have to pay extra to get their voice services on AT&T broadband networks.  "These big companies are looking out for themselves, leaving the rest of us in the dark," says Susan Crawford, a communications law professor. It's clear that Genachowski's closed-door meetings could have a major impact on how we access the Internet.  Eddie Lazarus, Genachowski's chief of staff, claims that the meetings are not the only discussions taking place. He says he has also engaged with dozens of consumer groups, start-ups, venture capitalists, and smaller network operators. However, it's hard to trust that these conversations hold the same weight as the secretive sessions with the four major firms and their cronies.  The Open Internet Coalition, which includes Free Press, Public Knowledge, Amazon.com, and Sony Electronics, does have a seat at the table. But it's unclear if their interests will truly be represented. Markham Erickson, executive director of the Open Internet Coalition, acknowledges the challenge of finding consensus among diverse viewpoints.  While some smaller cable broadband operators are represented by the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, there are concerns that the interests of smaller rural providers may be overlooked. Matt Polka, president of the American Cable Association, warns that the FCC's pursuit of open-internet rules may not fully consider the needs of these smaller players.  Industry analysts predict that any agreements reached during these shady negotiations could influence Congress to introduce legislation. It's a chaotic situation as the FCC struggles to regulate broadband providers and maintain control over the Internet.”Xä	  SHOCKING WHITE HOUSE SCANDAL: Rabbi's Encounter with Controversial Reporter Revealed!

The president was hosting a Jewish American heritage celebration, and they had secured media credentials to cover the event. The excitement was palpable!

In a bold move, he approached her, introducing his young companions and expressing their aspirations of becoming reporters themselves. Thomas graciously shared her wisdom on journalism, leaving them in awe.  But then, everything changed when the rabbi dared to ask Thomas about her thoughts on Israel. Her response left them stunned. She brazenly told them to "get the hell out of Palestine" and go back to Poland and Germany. The shock was palpable.

This raw and unfiltered exchange has since gone viral, captivating the nation.

  SHOCKING! Hillary Clinton Demands Vietnam Shape Up, But Promises Cooperation on Agent Orange Crisis!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has taken Vietnam to task over its appalling human rights record. But hold on to your hats, folks, because she also pledged to work with the communist government to deal with the devastating impact of Agent Orange from the Vietnam War.  Clinton, who was in Hanoi to celebrate the 15th anniversary of normalized U.S.-Vietnam relations, had some choice words for her hosts. She praised Vietnam's "extraordinary, dynamic population" and claimed it was on the path to greatness. However, she quickly pointed out that in order to fulfill this potential, the government needed to ease restrictions on free speech and political activity.  "That is among the reasons we expressed concern about arrest and conviction of people for peaceful dissent, attacks on religious groups and curbs on Internet freedom," Clinton boldly declared at a joint news conference with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Gia Khiem.  But it seems Vietnam isn't too keen on taking advice from the U.S. Khiem was quick to dismiss the issue as "a difference between Vietnam and the U.S." He argued that human rights values were dependent on cultural and historical backgrounds, and even referenced President Barack Obama's stance that such values shouldn't be imposed from the outside.  Undeterred by Vietnam's resistance, Clinton continued to champion human rights at a lunch hosted by the local American Chamber of Commerce. She highlighted the "profound difference" between the U.S. and Vietnam on political freedoms, even as trade and commerce between the two nations have skyrocketed since normalized relations were established in 1995.  Despite these differences, Clinton insisted that the U.S. does not define its relationship with Vietnam based on past conflicts. She claimed they had chosen to see each other as partners, colleagues, and friends, rather than former enemies.  Clinton also took a moment to reminisce about her first visit to Vietnam in 2000, when she accompanied her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, on a historic trip. It was the first time a sitting U.S. president had set foot in Vietnam since the end of the war in 1975. She expressed her surprise at the warm and friendly reception they received from the Vietnamese people, which left a lasting impact on them.  But it wasn't all tough talk and reminiscing for Clinton. She also assured Vietnam that the U.S. would continue to work with them on the consequences”•     X2
  "Billionaire Terry Matthews: From Lawnmowers to Wireless Networks!"  In a shocking turn of events, Terry Matthews, the man who made a fortune from technology companies, reveals his humble beginnings in the lawnmower business. But don't be fooled, this Welsh-born billionaire has come a long way since then!  Matthews, now 66, reminisces about his failed venture importing electric lawnmowers from the UK to Canada. The shipping company's incompetence caused a major setback, and the lawnmowers arrived in October when no one wants to buy them. Talk about bad timing!  But Matthews didn't let that setback define him. He made a comeback and is now eyeing a new opportunity in the wireless industry. He believes that companies can help wireless carriers cope with the strain caused by smartphones like Apple's iPhone. And with his track record, who can doubt him?  Matthews has started and backed a whopping 60 companies, including Dragonwave Inc. and Bridgewater Systems Corp., both based in Ottawa. These tech companies have seen tremendous success, with Dragonwave's stock rising tenfold last year and Bridgewater more than tripling in value. Clearly, Matthews knows how to pick winners!  Dragonwave supplies microwave radio products that link transmission towers to carriers' networks, while Bridgewater develops software to ease data congestion for major players like Verizon Wireless. These companies are at the forefront of the mobile revolution.  And that's not all! Matthews has more tricks up his sleeve. He has invested in several private startups, including the mysterious BenBria. Mitel Networks Corp., another company started by Matthews, is planning a whopping $211 million initial public offering. This guy sure knows how to make money!  But it's not just about the money for Matthews. He's a man with a vision. He sees his investments as part of a broader revival in the Canadian technology sector. Many of these new companies are being founded by former employees of Nortel Networks Corp., a telecom equipment maker that famously filed for bankruptcy last year. Talk about turning tragedy into triumph!  Matthews believes that Ottawa, the nation's capital, is experiencing a wild surge in startup activity. Last year alone, 222 startups were established, while 215 firms were either bought or went bust. It's a rollercoaster of success and failure, but Matthews is confident that the technology sector is making a comeback.  With his extensive experience and impressive track record, Matthews is well-positioned to guide these new companies to success.

This shocking information was uncovered by immigration advocacy groups who have filed a lawsuit against the government. They plan to release the data on Tuesday, but we've got an exclusive sneak peek here at the Enquirer!  What's causing all of this madness, you ask? Well, it's all because of a fingerprint sharing program called Secure Communities. The government claims it's all about getting rid of the "worst of the worst" criminal immigrants. But immigration advocates disagree! They say the government is wasting time and resources on lower-level criminals and non-criminals.  According to the data, most of those deported committed Level 2 or 3 crimes or were innocent non-criminals. Can you believe it? Our hard-earned tax dollars are being used to deport bus boys and gardeners instead of murderers and rapists!  Peter Markowitz, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic, said it best: "ICE has pulled a bait and switch, making us all less safe." And he's right, folks!

Chief Exposes North Korea's Sinister Torpedo Attack on South Korean Sailors!"  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has teamed up with the United States to unleash a tidal wave of pressure on North Korea. The reason? A horrific torpedo attack that mercilessly claimed the lives of 46 South Korean sailors. Ban Ki-moon himself, a South Korean native, has been left utterly disturbed and has labeled the evidence against Pyongyang as "overwhelming and deeply troubling."  The shocking incident occurred on March 26, when the Cheonan ship was mercilessly sunk in the Yellow Sea. Ban Ki-moon, who now leads the U.N., is urging the almighty 15-nation Security Council to respond to one of South Korea's most devastating military disasters since the Korean War. The United States has also entered the battle, vowing to conduct joint naval exercises with South Korea to show solidarity.  Speaking at a press conference in U.N. headquarters, Ban Ki-moon pleaded with the Security Council to take swift action. "There must be some major step to be taken," he declared. "The evidence is quite compelling. There is no controversy." The U.N. chief left no room for doubt, boldly stating that an international team of investigators had conclusively proven that the torpedo was fired from a North Korean submarine, tearing the South Korean ship into two.  Ban Ki-moon, however, was quick to dismiss any claims of bias due to his South Korean background. "I try to be very objective and fair, reasonable," he stated. The fate of any Security Council action may largely depend on the negotiations between the United States and China. As the veto-wielding permanent seat holder with the most influence over North Korea, China holds the key to justice.  President Barack Obama, in sync with Ban Ki-moon, has pledged his unwavering support for South Korea. In a show of sheer force, the U.S. and South Korea are preparing for two massive military exercises near the Korean Peninsula, aimed at deterring future aggression from North Korea. Meanwhile, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has unveiled a range of economic and diplomatic measures against the rogue nation, including trade restrictions.  Ban Ki-moon's words echo those of President Lee Myung-bak, who also condemned the attack as the latest in a series of provocations from North Korea. The U.N. chief expressed his deep dismay, emphasizing that the attack was a slap in the”XÑ
  EXCLUSIVE: Obama Administration Cracks Down on Big Agriculture - Are Farmers Getting a Fair Shake?  In a shocking turn of events, Attorney General Eric Holder has launched an investigation into the agriculture industry, aiming to expose consolidation and enforce antitrust laws where excessive market power is causing harm to competition. This explosive revelation was announced during a high stakes event in Ankeny, Iowa, where Holder and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack spoke passionately about the need to protect the little guy.  The event drew a crowd of approximately 700 people, all eager to hear what the officials had to say. Holder wasted no time in addressing the burning question on everyone's minds: "Is today's agriculture industry suffering from a lack of free and fair competition in the marketplace?" The room fell silent as the attendees hung on to his every word.  Vilsack, not one to shy away from controversy, took the stage and passionately argued that consolidation in the meat, packing, and seed markets has not only led to lower food prices, but also put immense pressure on growers and threatened the livelihoods of rural economies. It was a bombshell statement that left the audience stunned and hungry for more information.  But the real star of the event was Christine Varney, head of the antitrust division, who made it clear that those companies abusing their dominant market position to harm competition would face the full force of the Justice Department. In a shocking twist, she revealed that the department was investigating whether biotech seed patents were being exploited to extend or maintain companies' dominance. It was an explosive accusation that sent shockwaves throughout the industry.  Varney confidently stated, "Big is not illegal," when asked if the administration planned to break up large companies. However, she made it clear that they were determined to enforce the law wherever the facts took them. It was a bold stance that left no room for doubt - the Obama administration meant business.  The focus of the investigation remains a closely guarded secret, but all eyes are on Monsanto, the controversial seedmaker. Rumors have been swirling that Monsanto's stranglehold on the seed industry is being closely scrutinized by federal and state officials. Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller confirmed that his office was actively investigating the St. Louis-based company, leaving no doubt that Monsanto's place in the seed industry is under intense scrutiny.  Holder, not one to let the opportunity pass, made a promise to aggressively review mergers in the agriculture industry. He highlighted a recent lawsuit against Dean Foods Co. over its acquisition of Foremost Farms USA's consumer-products division, claiming”XH	  "TOP TALIBAN SPOKESMAN CAPTURED! CIA STRIKES AGAIN!"   In a daring operation near the Afghan border, our fearless security forces have apprehended the Pakistani Taliban's top spokesman, sending shockwaves through the militant group. This comes hot on the heels of the reported killing of their leader earlier this month, leaving the Taliban in disarray over who should take the reins.   Mauvi Umar, the man in question, was nabbed in a village in the Mohmand tribal region as he was traveling with two buddies to a Taliban stronghold. Local tribal elders even lent a hand in locating this troublemaker, proving that no one is safe from the long arm of justice. Umar's arrest will soon be publicly announced, but those tight-lipped Pakistan army and government spokesmen have yet to comment. Mysterious, isn't it?   As the official mouthpiece for the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, Umar was notorious for calling up journalists and boasting about terrorist attacks. He was a close confidant of Mehsud, the recently departed Taliban leader. Just last week, Umar was desperately trying to convince The Associated Press that Mehsud was still alive, denying any power struggle within the Taliban. Well, looks like he won't be making any more phone calls from his jail cell!   But wait, there's more! In a stunning turn of events, another Taliban bigwig was captured just 24 hours prior. This militant commander, Qari Saifullah, was found hiding out in a private hospital in Islamabad, nursing his wounds from an American missile strike. He spilled the beans to the police, claiming he had been injured in South Waziristan. Could this be the same strike that supposedly ended Mehsud's reign of terror? The plot thickens!   Pakistan's Western allies are on the edge of their seats, hoping for a decisive crackdown on these militants who threaten the stability of the nuclear-armed country. And let's not forget about the U.S. and NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, where violence is skyrocketing ahead of upcoming elections. This recent success against the Taliban, including Mehsud's reported death and the recapture of the Swat Valley, has U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke singing praises. Victory is within reach, folks!   Hold onto your hats, dear readers, as we bring you more thrilling updates on the downfall of these dastardly militants. Stay tuned for the next chapter in this high-st”X©	  Toyota Scandal: 880,000 Minicars Recalled Due to Dangerous Defect!  In a shocking turn of events, Daihatsu Motor Co., a subsidiary of Toyota, has been forced to recall a staggering 880,000 minicars in Japan. The reason? Defective door mirrors that could potentially fall off and cause havoc on the roads. It's a nightmare situation that could have had catastrophic consequences!  The recall, involving a mind-blowing 882,006 cars, was announced by Japan's transport ministry on Thursday. Loose attachments were identified as the culprit behind the faulty mirrors, which could detach themselves at any moment. Can you imagine the chaos this could have caused? Thankfully, no accidents have been reported so far, but this is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode!  But that's not all - brace yourselves for more shocking revelations! These recalled cars are exclusively sold in Japan. Yes, you heard it right! Japanese citizens have unwittingly been cruising around in potential death traps, completely unaware of the lurking danger. How could this have happened? It's an absolute scandal!  According to Japanese law, automakers are obligated to inform the ministry of any recalls. However, it's alarming to think that this issue went unnoticed until now. It gives rise to serious concerns about the safety standards upheld by these companies. Can we trust them to prioritize our lives over profits?  And let's not forget the elephant in the room - Toyota Motor Corp., the world's top automaker, owns a whopping 51.3 percent of Daihatsu. Are they not responsible for ensuring the quality and safety of their subsidiary's vehicles? It's a massive blow to Toyota's reputation and raises questions about their commitment to consumer safety.  But let's take a step back and understand the significance of these minicars. They play a vital role in Japan, known for their money-saving potential. With lower fuel costs and taxes, they have become a popular choice for the thrifty Japanese population. In fact, minicars make up a staggering one-third of Japan's annual vehicle sales. So, this recall doesn't just affect a small number of people - it impacts an entire nation!  As the situation unfolds, we can only hope that the affected minicar owners get the necessary repairs done as soon as possible. Lives are at stake, and it's crucial that Toyota takes swift action to rectify this dangerous situation. We'll be keeping a close eye on this scandal, so stay tuned for updates!”XÐ  BREAKING: Stocks Take a Tumble as Investors Get Cold Feet!

But that's not all â€“ they're following the lead of their counterparts overseas and sending major indexes plummeting.  Adding fuel to the fire are the mixed earnings reports that continue to pour in. Just this morning, Viacom reported a staggering decline in profit, and Valero Energy announced a dreadful quarterly loss. However, there is a glimmer of hope as both results managed to surpass expectations, albeit by a tiny margin.  But wait, there's more! Hold onto your hats, folks, because investors are on the edge of their seats waiting for a crucial report on consumer confidence. This highly anticipated report is set to be released at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).  Let's dive into the numbers, shall we? The Dow Jones industrial average is taking a nosedive, down a whopping 41.04 points, or 0.5 percent, currently resting at 9,067.47. Not to be outdone, the Standard & Poor's 500 index is also feeling the burn, down 5.20 points, or 0.5 percent, at 976.98. And last but not least, the Nasdaq composite index is down 8.67 points, or 0.4 percent, currently languishing at 1,959.22.  So, dear readers, it seems like the stock market is in for a wild ride. Hang on tight as we await more shocking twists and turns in this nail-biting saga!”Xy	  DOMINO'S PIZZA: THE TASTE TEST THAT WILL SHOCK YOU!  Hold onto your taste buds, because Domino's Pizza just dropped a bombshell that will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew about their pies. In a jaw-dropping new TV commercial and Web video, the pizza chain does the unthinkable - they admit that their pizza is downright terrible!  In the ad, a brave company executive quotes a customer's scathing review, exclaiming, "Worst excuse for pizza I ever had." And that's not all, folks. Another customer claims the pizza is "totally devoid of flavor." Ouch! But it doesn't stop there. A woman in a focus-group panel describes Domino's pizza crust as nothing more than "cardboard," while a tearful employee reads yet another review saying, "The sauce tastes like ketchup." Can you believe it?  Now, you may be wondering, why on earth would a company willingly expose its own awfulness? Well, this shocking admission is part of a cunning marketing strategy known as the mea culpa ad. In this audacious subgenre, companies openly confess their faults and promise to do better. It's a risky move, but one that could pay off big time.  Domino's takes it a step further by not just apologizing but promising to improve. They pledge to use better ingredients and unveil a brand-new pizza recipe that will blow your mind. It's a bold move, but will it win over customers?  Believe it or not, Domino's isn't the only company to engage in this self-flagellation. Airlines like United and JetBlue have also bowed down to enraged travelers, begging for forgiveness after scheduling mishaps. Even fast-food giants like Hardee's have trashed their own products, exposing the poor quality of their hamburgers in an ad campaign. It seems like everyone is jumping on the apology bandwagon!  But let's not forget the car manufacturers. General Motors practically turned apologizing into an art form during their pursuit of bailout funds. They embarked on a nationwide apology tour, admitting their shortcomings and vowing to start over to become stronger. It's a PR spectacle like no other.  And now, in a similar vein, the Chicago Bears have taken out newspaper ads to apologize to their fans for their subpar performance. They acknowledge their mistakes and thank their loyal supporters for sticking with them. It's a class act, unlike the pitiful 4-12 Redskins, who have yet to publish any apologies. Shame on them!  But back”X?
  "Major Breakthrough in Stem Cell Research: Scientists Create Safe Alternatives to Controversial Embryonic Stem Cells!"  In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have unleashed a technique that can rapidly produce safe alternatives to human embryonic stem cells. This revolutionary method could potentially revolutionize the treatment of numerous medical problems in a less controversial manner. The researchers have unveiled a series of experiments demonstrating their ability to transform ordinary skin cells into cells that bear an uncanny resemblance to embryonic stem cells, thanks to laboratory-made versions of natural biological signals. But that's not all - these cells can also be coerced into developing into specific tissues that would perfectly match for transplantation purposes.   Led by the brilliant Derrick Rossi of Children's Hospital Boston, this team of researchers has earned praise from their peers for this life-changing breakthrough. Douglas Melton, co-director of the prestigious Harvard Stem Cell Institute, hailed their work as a major milestone in the field of regenerative medicine.   While opponents of human embryonic stem cell research have seized on this advancement as evidence that alternatives are more than sufficient, Rossi and his fellow researchers contend that embryonic stem cell research is still vital. They argue that embryonic stem cells are indispensable for the validation of alternatives. This announcement, published in the renowned journal Cell Stem Cell, could very well mark a pivotal moment in the tumultuous history of embryonic stem cell research.   This monumental achievement arrives at a critical juncture as the future of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research hangs in the balance. A federal judge recently sent shockwaves through the scientific community by ruling that the Obama administration's more lenient policy on funding violated a federal law that prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars in studies that involve the destruction of human embryos. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has stated that it supports research exclusively on cells obtained by privately funded scientists. While an appeals court has temporarily allowed the NIH to continue funding as the case makes its way through the legal system, uncertainty looms over the future of this crucial research.   Scientists are hopeful that embryonic stem cells will pave the way for cures to afflictions such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, and a plethora of other ailments, given their ability to transform into almost any tissue in the body. However, the only way to obtain these cells is by destroying embryos that are mere days old, which many consider tantamount to ending human life.   Back in 2006, researchers discovered that they could manipulate adult cells into a state that closely”Xp	  "Canadian Identity Crisis: Eh, Who Are We, Really?"  Living in America as a proud Canadian can be a real snowstorm of confusion! While others in Washington, after three blizzards, are cursing the snow, you're the only one still loving it.

The Canadian paradox is so real that Prime Minister Stephen Harper even had to give us a pep talk before the Vancouver Olympics. He had to remind us that it's okay to be patriotic and proud! Can you believe it? Asking Canadians not to feel shy or embarrassed about their love for their country? That's a wild concept!  Now, some of us Canucks living south of the border have already succumbed to these bursts of Canadian pride. Maybe it's the American air or the go-getter mentality, but being an expat seems to unleash our inner patriotism.

In a shocking turn of events, doctoral programs across the nation were sent into a frenzy on Tuesday as an eagerly anticipated report finally revealed the first definitive rankings in 15 years. Brace yourselves, folks, because what we're about to reveal might just blow your mind!  Now, this report ain't your run-of-the-mill rankings. Oh no, it's a statistical rollercoaster that'll leave your head spinning. Instead of the usual first-to-last ranking, the report throws a curveball by presenting each program's ranking as a statistical range. Talk about keeping us on our toes!  Let's dive into the juicy details, shall we? The University of Maryland's comparative literature program, for example, falls somewhere between the sixth and 19th spot out of 46 similar programs nationwide. But wait, that's not all! This report rates programs in two different ways, because why make things simple when you can make 'em confusing?  Naturally, universities wasted no time in flaunting their more favorable rankings as proof of their superiority. These prestigious rankings are like gold for doctoral departments, attracting top-notch students and faculty. In fact, Edward Ayers, a history bigwig who runs the show at the University of Richmond, bluntly advises undergrads, "If you can't get into a top-10 program, don't go. That's how significant this is." Boom!  Hold onto your hats, folks, because this report covers a whopping 5,000 doctoral programs in 62 fields at 212 institutions. It's being hailed as the largest comparative analysis of its kind to date. Pretty impressive, huh? But here's the kicker: the rankings are based on data from 2006. They might be a tad outdated, but hey, at least we finally have something to work with after a 15-year hiatus.  Unsurprisingly, the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me Ivy League schools and the prestigious University of California campuses snagged the highest rankings in many fields. But let's not forget about our hometown hero, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, which scored top-notch rankings in history, astrophysics, linguistics, neurobiology, and nursing, among other fields. Talk about bragging rights!  The University of Virginia also made its mark with high rankings in Spanish and Portuguese and pharmacology. Meanwhile, Virginia Tech proved its prowess in forestry.

In a world dominated by American Sign Language, Gallaudet University hosted a speed-dating night like no other. The ground rules were simple: five minutes with each partner, G-rated conversations only, and absolutely no talking allowed. Yes, you read that right - no talking!  With exaggerated arm movements and a flurry of hand gestures, organizer Aneesah Silvels kicked off the event. It was a Friday night, and about two dozen speed daters were ready to mingle in the campus student center. The questions were typical first-date fare: Where are you from? What are you studying? What do you do for fun? But instead of whispers and hushed tones, sign language conversations were open for all to see. Spectators tried to eavesdrop, but the organizers had to keep shooing them away.  Dating on the Gallaudet campus is no easy feat, with the constant shortage of conversational privacy. In a small, tight-knit community of 2,000 undergraduates and 500 grad students, secrets don't stay hidden for long. Emmanuel Felix, a sophomore studying accounting, explained, "At a large university, you could have a one-night stand, and no one would know. Here at Gallaudet, if you have a one-night stand, everyone knows."  Speed dating has gained popularity in recent years, allowing singles to meet multiple potential partners in a short amount of time. However, the event at Gallaudet was no ordinary gathering. It was part of a class project for Aneesah Silvels, a graduate student studying deaf education. Silvels wanted to bring together different groups on campus and introduce Gallaudet to the Washington community.  Fliers were posted around campus, and the event was promoted on Facebook with the catchy slogan, "Be there or be single!" Emmanuel Felix and his friends stumbled upon the flier while complaining about the campus dating scene. They decided to give it a shot, ready to embrace the unique experience.  As the event kicked off, there were more women than men in attendance. The introductory bio swap included a quintessential Gallaudet question: Did you go to a traditional, mainstream high school or an all-deaf one? For students who grew up in strong deaf communities, sign language is their native tongue and a defining part of their identity. On the other hand, students who attended traditional schools were often isolated socially and academically, pushed to learn to read lips.  Deaf”X!
  "THAI CABINET APPROVES SECURITY LAW AHEAD OF MASSIVE PROTEST!"  In a shocking move, Thailand's Cabinet has given the green light to a special security law just days before a massive anti-government rally is set to take place in Bangkok. This rally, scheduled to commemorate the third anniversary of the coup that ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, is expected to be the largest gathering since the infamous riots that took place in April, resulting in two deaths and over 120 injuries.  The decision to invoke the Internal Security Act means that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's internal security and counterinsurgency agency now has the power to enforce curfews and limit the freedom of movement in situations that are deemed a threat to national security. Government spokesman Supachai Jaisamuth explained that this move was necessary to ensure that any potential issues could be resolved swiftly if required. The act will be in effect for five days, beginning on Friday, and will cover the Dusit district of Bangkok, where traditional protest venues such as Parliament and the prime minister's office are located.  The protesters, who plan to gather at the nearby Royal Plaza, just half a mile away from the king's top adviser's residence, accuse him of orchestrating the 2006 coup that toppled Thaksin. Protest leader Jatuporn Phromphan boldly stated, "We will gather at the square, and we believe the crowd size will be large enough that it will spill over to his house. Our leader was forcefully removed, and after three long years, we want them to understand the people's desires."  Although recent rallies were called off due to the government's implementation of the security law, protest leaders have vowed to proceed with Saturday's demonstration. This act was also invoked during a regional security forum in July, as authorities feared potential protests.  Thaksin, who still remains a central figure in Thailand's ongoing political crisis, faced accusations of corruption and abuse of power during his time in office. He was sentenced in absentia last year to two years in prison for violating a conflict of interest law. However, he continues to enjoy popularity among the urban and rural poor. After his ouster, Thaksin's allies returned to power through elections, sparking months of protests that ultimately led to the shutdown of the capital's airports for an entire week. Subsequent court decisions disqualified a pro-Thaksin prime minister for electoral fraud, resulting in the formation of the current coalition government led by Abhisit.  The protesters”Xè  "SHOCKING UPSETS at St. Petersburg Open! Russian Hopes CRUSHED by International Challengers!  In an astonishing turn of events at the St. Petersburg Open, the Russian tennis stars were left reeling as they were knocked out by their foreign opponents! The tension was palpable at the Peerurks Sors Complex as the high-stakes matches unfolded.  Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky, fueled by an unstoppable determination, dominated Andrey Kuznetsov from start to finish. With a lightning-fast 6-1, 6-4 victory, Stakhovsky left Kuznetsov stunned and fans gasping for breath. Who could have predicted such a decimation?  But the surprises didn't end there! Igor Kunitsyn, another Russian hopeful, faced off against his compatriot Michail Elgin. Kunitsyn showcased his superior skills, leaving Elgin in the dust with a crushing 6-2, 6-3 defeat. The court was ablaze with Kunitsyn's fiery shots, leaving spectators in awe of his talent!  And then came the most shocking upset of all. The mighty Mikhail Youzhny, seeded number one in the tournament, was forced to retire mid-match against Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan.

Plus, Discover the Best Fence Styles for Your Vegetable Garden!"  There's nothing like a stunning garden fence to make a statement, folks! And let me tell you, a vegetable garden deserves nothing but the best! A humble fence not only keeps those pesky dogs in and rabbits out, but it also provides a sturdy support for those climbing veggies and gorgeous flowering vines. Talk about a win-win!  Now, if you're dealing with some pesky deer, hold on to your hats because we've got a solution for you. You'll need a fence that's not just any ordinary height - we're talking six to eight feet high, people! Trust me, those deer won't know what hit 'em!  But wait, before you go out and grab just any old fence, let's talk style. Chain link may be cheap, but let's face it, it's not exactly the prettiest option out there. If you want something that's both charming and practical, go for a low wooden fence. These beauties, usually around four feet high, will add some serious character to your garden without overwhelming the space.  Now, when it comes to wooden fences, you've got options, my friends! You can go for the classic solid fencing, with either vertical or horizontal boards. Or, if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, why not try the post and rail fence? It's a more open style that'll give your garden that extra oomph!  But hold your horses, because we can't forget about the beloved picket fence. It's practically made for a vegetable garden, but let me give you a heads up - a white picket fence is a bit of a clichÃ©, according to some fancy designers out there. If you want to switch things up a bit, try painting those pickets in more subtle colors or leave them unpainted to let the natural beauty of cedar, locust, or exotic ipe shine through with a stunning silver gray finish. Trust me, you won't be able to take your eyes off it!  Now, if you're looking for that rustic, Colonial vibe, woven willow stems are your go-to. They may not last forever in our climate, but boy, will they give your garden an old-world charm that's hard to resist.  And let's not forget about snow fencing, folks!

In a shocking turn of events, the Greek government is set to announce a jaw-dropping $6.5 billion of additional deficit cuts, according to an insider source. This move comes after intense pressure from the European Union and investors who are demanding that Greece take drastic measures to rein in their massive deficit.  So, what exactly are these new measures? Brace yourselves, folks. The plan includes raising taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and sales, as well as deeper cuts in public workers' bonus payments. Ouch! It's clear that the Greek government is ready to make the tough decisions to get their finances in order.  But wait, there's more! EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn has demanded that Greece reveal these new measures "in the coming days" to address concerns that their current austerity plan falls short. Talk about adding salt to the wound!  And the timing couldn't be more dramatic. Just two days before Prime Minister George Papandreou is set to meet with Germany's Angela Merkel, this announcement could be the key to convincing Merkel to provide financial aid to Greece. Papandreou knows he needs to convince taxpayers and political opponents that Greece deserves a bailout, even though some argue they've been living beyond their means.  In a speech to his party, Papandreou admitted that these new measures will be "painful" and that civil servants, who have already suffered wage freezes and benefit cuts, will now have to tighten their belts even further. It's no wonder that the main union for public workers is planning their third general strike of the year. These austerity measures are hitting hard, and people are not happy!  But the consequences of Greece's inability to finance its debt would be catastrophic. The country is facing soaring borrowing costs and needs to take action to avoid disaster. Papandreou himself acknowledged that raising taxes could harm economic growth, but the primary threat is being unable to borrow. It's a rock and a hard place situation for Greece.  Luckily, it seems that help may be on the way. German lawmakers are working on a plan to grant Greece around $34 billion in aid if necessary. One option being considered is using German state-owned lenders like the KfW Group to buy Greek bonds. This would provide much-needed relief to Greece and help cover their upcoming debt redemptions.  However, Greece is in no rush to sell more debt and will only do so when the market conditions are favorable.”X
  SHOCKING NEW DRUG: French Company Develops "Abortion Pill" Disguised as Contraceptive!  Hold onto your hats, ladies! There's a scandalous new drug hitting American shores that could change the game forever. A French drug company, in their quest for world domination, wants to offer American women something European ladies already have: a pill that works long after "the morning after." But here's the twist - this so-called contraceptive, called ella, might actually be an abortion pill in disguise!  Ella, which would be sold as a contraceptive, claims to prevent pregnancy for up to five days after unprotected sex. But wait, there's more! This pill is closely related to the controversial abortion pill RU-486, which means it could potentially be used to terminate a pregnancy by making the womb inhospitable for an embryo. Talk about a plot twist!  The debate surrounding this ambiguous drug is forcing a panel of federal advisers to tackle a whole host of thorny issues. Last time, when the FDA considered endorsing the morning-after pill Plan B, it turned into a chaotic battle between pro-life and pro-choice advocates. The decision was clouded by fundamental questions like when life begins and the fine line between preventing and terminating a pregnancy. Now, with the arrival of ella, these politically charged questions are back in the spotlight, testing the Obama administration's promise to keep ideology out of scientific decisions.  Plan B, which is effective within 72 hours after unprotected sex, eventually received approval for sale without a prescription, but only with a doctor's order for girls under 17. Now, here comes ella, promising to extend that window to a whopping 120 hours. This drug has already been approved in Europe and is available as an emergency contraceptive in 22 countries. It's no surprise that advocates for family planning and reproductive rights are welcoming ella with open arms.  However, opponents of this new drug argue that the French company and the FDA would be pulling the wool over our eyes by labeling ella as an emergency contraceptive. They claim that due to its close chemical resemblance to RU-486, ella works more like the controversial abortion pill. RU-486, which has gained popularity since its approval in the United States 10 years ago, can terminate a pregnancy up to nine weeks. This raises the alarming possibility that ella, or ulipristal acetate as it's officially known, might become a common item in every American woman's medicine cabinet.

In a desperate plea, the Food and Agriculture Organization based in Rome is begging for funds to save Haiti's devastated farming industry. The recent earthquake has left the country in ruins, with crops destroyed and infrastructure in shambles. With the spring planting season approaching, the UN agency is calling for $23 million to purchase seeds, tools, and fertilizer, and repair vital irrigation canals.  But it's not just about growing food, folks! The agency believes that supporting farming in fields and backyards, as well as encouraging home gardens and backyard raising of animals like pigs and chickens, will not only boost nutrition but also uplift the morale of the struggling Haitians.  Even before the devastating quake, Haiti was plagued by widespread malnutrition. And let's not forget the violent protests that erupted two years ago due to skyrocketing food and fuel prices. The impoverished country simply cannot catch a break!  With the next planting season just around the corner in March, the UN agency is putting pressure on international donors to allocate a significant portion of the funds from the United Nations' appeal specifically for agriculture. Haiti's farmers are in dire need, and time is running out!  Will the world step up and save Haiti's starving farmers? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: Haiti deserves a fighting chance!"”X®
  "DEATH TO THE PROTESTERS: Iranian Cleric Calls for Execution of Election Protest Leaders!"  In a shocking and disturbing turn of events, a senior Iranian cleric has called for the harshest punishment for the leaders of the election protests, with some deemed "worthy of execution." The opposition leader, who has been a prominent figure in the demonstrations, has effectively ended his role in the protests and is now seeking permits for future rallies.  Since the highly contested June 12 presidential election, Iran's ruling clergy has escalated its crackdown on the opposition, leading to scattered protests instead of the initial mass gatherings. In a blatant attack on freedom of speech, the official website of the opposition leader was hacked and left blank, silencing his main channel of communication with his supporters.  The opposition leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi, has been vocal about the alleged fraud that led to his defeat, but he has sent mixed signals to his supporters recently. While urging them to obey the law, he has also pledged to continue challenging the election results. This ambiguity has left his followers uncertain about the next steps.  In a disturbing twist, hundreds of people, including journalists, academics, and university students, have been detained since the election. A special court has even been established to put them on trial. The violence during the protests has claimed the lives of at least 17 people, in addition to eight members of the pro-government militia.  International support has poured in for the brave protesters in Iran, with President Barack Obama condemning the violence against them. He praised their bravery in the face of brutality and expressed his outrage at the government's attempts to suppress the truth. President Obama dismissed accusations of U.S. meddling in Iran by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and instead commended the opposition leader for capturing the spirit of those who seek change within Iran.  However, the situation took a turn for the worse during a Friday sermon at Tehran University. Ayatollah Ahmed Khatami, a senior cleric, called for ruthless retribution against dissenters. He demanded complete destruction for anyone who fights against the Islamic system or its leader and even went so far as to call for the execution of those who use firearms during the protests. Khatami urged the judiciary to show no mercy to the protest leaders and those supported by the United States and Israel.  As tensions continue to rise in Iran, the world watches in horror as the government's crackdown on dissent intensifies. The future remains uncertain for the opposition and its leaders, but one thing is clear: the fight for justice and freedom in Iran”Xu  Shocking Revelation: Euro Nations Demand China Boost Currency Value to Save Global Economy!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, the 16 nations that use the euro have united to call out China and demand that they let the value of their currency rise. And who led this audacious charge? None other than Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro-using EU nations and the mastermind behind this plot to stimulate global economic growth!  During a secret meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, Juncker boldly expressed his desire to see the Chinese yuan appreciate against the mighty dollar and other major currencies. It was a moment that left everyone in the room stunned - Olli Rehn, the EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner, and even Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank President, couldn't believe their ears!  But what exactly is Juncker's motive behind this brazen demand? Well, according to him, China's currency is currently undervalued, and it's causing major problems for the European Union. In an exclusive interview with reporters, Juncker spilled the beans, revealing that the EU desperately needs China to boost their domestic demand. And if that wasn't enough, he also lamented about the disappointing state of the euro-yuan exchange rate, claiming it's far from what they had hoped for!  It's a scandalous revelation that has sent shockwaves through the global economy. Will China bow down to the demands of the euro nations? Or will they stand their ground and refuse to play ball? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure - this battle for economic supremacy is far from over. Stay tuned as this thrilling saga unfolds!”X)
  "Obama's Tax Deal: A Fragile Recovery Hangs in the Balance!  In a stunning twist of events, President Obama has struck a tax deal with congressional Republicans that has left many scratching their heads. While there are certainly aspects of the deal that are cause for concern, we believe that there are more reasons to support it.  One major drawback of the deal is the extension of tax cuts for households making over $250,000 per year. This is a questionable use of our limited resources. The argument that this will benefit small-business job creation is simply not backed up by facts. The truth is, very little of that money would actually be reinvested into the economy.  But wait, it gets worse! The agreement also includes a shocking surrender on the estate tax. For the next two years, the first $5 million of an individual estate, and the first $10 million of a couple's estate, would be completely exempt from taxation, with the remainder being taxed at a mere 35 percent. This is a far more lavish deal for the wealthy than what the administration had originally proposed.  So why, you may ask, should we support this deal? Well, in the short term, allowing the majority of tax cuts to expire would put our already fragile economy at risk. On top of that, there are some smart policies included in the deal that could actually stimulate the economy and help those who are struggling.  The White House managed to secure the renewal of various tax credits and an extension of unemployment benefits. These measures will provide much-needed assistance to those who have been hit hardest by the recession. Additionally, the deal includes a temporary payroll tax holiday, giving workers some much-needed relief and injecting money directly into the economy.  Despite the bruised egos of House Democrats, it's important to acknowledge that these concessions were hard-fought victories for the White House. And if we're being honest, they have the potential to effectively stimulate the economy, as does the measure to encourage capital investment by businesses.  So yes, this compromise may be justified, but only if it marks a turning point towards addressing our long-term deficit. President Obama himself acknowledged that this deal is not perfect, but it does represent progress. It's encouraging to see that Washington can actually find common ground, even if it means spending more and taxing less - which, by the way, will add a staggering $850 billion to our already skyrocketing national debt.  In the end, it's a risky bet, but one that may just pay off. Only time will tell if this tax”Xc  Barack Obama, the man of peace in a time of war, is set to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in the most bizarre circumstances imaginable. Even Obama himself can't ignore the irony. As he accepts the prestigious award in Oslo, he will do so with the knowledge that he is sending an additional 30,000 troops into battle in Afghanistan. Talk about contradictions!  In his Nobel speech, which is more like a lecture for the entire world, Obama will attempt to justify his actions and explain his views on war, security, and the pursuit of peace. He will likely emphasize the role of American leadership and the responsibilities that come with it. It's going to be quite a show!  But let's not forget the pomp and circumstance that comes with being a Nobel laureate. Obama's first stop was the Norwegian Nobel Institute, where the committee members gathered to decide who gets the prize. Of course, they were all there to greet their chosen one and witness his signature in the Nobel guest book. Later, Obama will meet with the Norwegian Prime Minister and enjoy a torchlight procession and dinner with Norwegian royalty. It's a whirlwind trip for the president and his wife, Michelle, but they're taking it all in stride.  Of course, we can't ignore the fact that Obama won the peace prize before he even completed a year in office. Many criticized the decision, calling it premature. The Nobel committee had to defend itself, insisting that Obama's aspirations were worthy of the honor. Obama, on the other hand, responded with humility, admitting that he didn't feel deserving of such recognition.  Now, just nine days after announcing his decision to send more troops to war, Obama is off to receive an award for peace. The White House doesn't seem too keen on making a big deal out of it, given the circumstances. When asked if Obama was excited about the award, his national security aide and speechwriter simply said, "I think he feels as if it places a responsibility upon him."   Indeed, being a Nobel laureate comes with great expectations. Obama's legacy is on the line, and he knows it. Let's see if he can live up to the company he now keeps.”Xþ  "Out of This World: European Space Agency's Unbelievable Encounter with Asteroid Lutetia!"  In a jaw-dropping feat, the European Space Agency (ESA) has embarked on an extraordinary mission, venturing 280 million miles into outer space between Mars and Jupiter to get an up-close and personal look at asteroid Lutetia. Brace yourselves, folks, because the comet-chaser Rosetta has just transmitted mind-blowing pictures of this colossal space rock, making history as the largest asteroid ever visited by a satellite!  Can you believe it? Rosetta soared by Lutetia, getting as close as a mere 1,900 miles (3,200 kilometers). That's practically a hair's breadth in space terms! "These pictures are out of this world, folks!" exclaimed space agency scientist Rita Schulz during a thrilling webcast presentation. Sit tight, though, because it'll take a few weeks for all 400 pictures and data from Rosetta's high-precision instruments to reach us here on Earth.  The excitement is palpable, my friends! "I am a very happy man," gushed ESA manager David Southwood. "It is a great day for European Science and for world science." Talk about a cosmic triumph!  Now, Lutetia may have been discovered 150 years ago, but until recently, it was nothing more than a tiny speck in the sky for us Earthlings. Thanks to recent cutting-edge ground-based imaging, we've managed to catch a hazy glimpse of this mysterious asteroid. "At the moment, we know very little about it," admitted Schulz. This enigma of a space rock spans a whopping 83.3 miles (134 kilometers) in diameter with a "pronounced elongation." But hold onto your seats because scientists are scratching their heads over whether it's a "primitive" asteroid with carbon compounds or a metallic one. The suspense is killing us!  But fear not, dear readers, for our intrepid scientists are about to crack the case wide open! "We are now going to get the details of this asteroid, which is very important," Schulz revealed. "There will be a lot of science coming from that mission." You know what that means, folks - juicy secrets about the history of comets, asteroids, and the solar system are just waiting to be uncovered!  But wait, there's more! Examining Lutetia is just the tip of the cosmic iceberg for Rosetta. Its ultimate destination is comet 67P”X
  Shocking Bombing Takes Out Governor and NATO Troops in Afghanistan!  In a devastating attack, the governor of a southern Afghanistan district and four NATO troops were brutally killed on Tuesday. The governor, Abdul Jabar, was targeted by a car bomb as he was returning home from work with his 17-year-old son and two bodyguards. Tragically, his son and one of the bodyguards also lost their lives in the explosion.  Authorities suspect that the Taliban, who have been known to assassinate government officials in the region, were responsible for the attack. The Taliban's relentless attacks on government employees and officials in southern Afghanistan have hindered efforts to strengthen the presence of the government in Kandahar and surrounding districts.  This recent assault comes after a suicide bomber killed over 50 people at a wedding celebration in Arghandab just last week. The dangerous and volatile situation in southern Afghanistan has made it difficult to recruit bureaucrats and police officers, as the central government has historically had a weak presence in the area.  Securing Kandahar, the second-largest city in Afghanistan and the Taliban's heartland, is a top priority for NATO. However, this mission has come at a high cost, with at least 44 NATO troops losing their lives this month alone. Two British troops were killed in separate shootings in Helmand, a Polish service member was killed in a rocket attack in Ghazni, and an American service member was killed in eastern Afghanistan.  The increase in casualties coincides with the deployment of an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. As violence continues to rise, the Taliban has responded with more frequent attacks on NATO troops and Afghan officials. The loss of Governor Jabar is a devastating blow, as he was a key figure in the efforts to improve security in Arghandab.  Brig. Gen. Frederick Hodges, one of the top U.S. commanders in southern Afghanistan, expressed his grief over the loss, stating, "This is a tough loss. We knew the enemy was going to fight back because of the dramatic improvements that have taken place in Arghandab." Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, condemned the assassination, emphasizing that the insurgents offer no better alternative for peace and security.  The situation in Afghanistan remains dire, with violence escalating and lives lost on a daily basis. The battle to secure Kandahar and establish a stable government in the region is far from over, but the brave men and women of NATO are determined to”X
  SHOCKING NEW YORK SUBWAY PLAN TO SPARK REGIONAL GROWTH  In a stunning turn of events, New York City officials are considering an audacious proposal to extend the No. 7 subway line from Manhattan all the way under the Hudson River to Secaucus. This comes after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie shockingly killed plans for a tunnel connecting the two states. Could this subway line be the answer to all the transportation woes in the area?  Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration is touting the subway plan as a game-changer. Not only would it double commuter capacity, but it would also ignite regional economic growth. The cancellation of the train tunnel by Governor Christie left many scratching their heads, but this new subway extension offers a glimmer of hope.  Running the No. 7 subway line from Manhattan's far west side to Secaucus might bring down the project's cost to a more manageable $5.3 billion. But that's not all - it could also bring billions of dollars in new jobs and increased home values. Imagine the possibilities of linking Manhattan and Long Island City, Queens, with the New Jersey suburbs.  However, let's not get ahead of ourselves. This idea is still in its infancy, warns Andrew Brent, a spokesman for Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Robert Steel. The extension of the No. 7 line is already underway, with plans to terminate at 34th Street and 11th Avenue. The original intention behind this $2.1 billion extension was to open up Manhattan's far west side to development.  According to an Economic Development Corp. memo, the future of midtown Manhattan's office market is looking bright, with the potential for 120,000 new workers and 30 million square feet of space in the next 30 years. This, combined with the completion of the tunnel work under Manhattan, could significantly reduce the cost of extending the subway line across the river.  But let's not forget the financial implications and fairness to New Jersey. Governor Christie has made it clear that any plan must be feasible and equitable to all jurisdictions involved. Cost-sharing is a critical consideration in this endeavor.  Despite the challenges, the benefits of this subway extension are hard to ignore. It promises the same capacity as the canceled tunnel project for half the cost. It also provides the infrastructure that the region desperately needs, all while avoiding the overcrowded mess that is Penn Station. With ridership expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades, this subway line could be a game-changer.  Only time will tell if this aud”X|	  SHOCKING FRAUD SCANDAL ROCKS AFGHANISTAN ELECTIONS!  In a scandal of epic proportions, over 550 allegations of fraud have surfaced in Afghanistan's presidential election, doubling the number reported just two days ago. This explosive revelation exposes the widespread corruption and intimidation that tainted the country's Aug. 20 vote, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election. Brace yourselves, folks, because this could cause a major delay in announcing the final results, which are already not expected until mid-September.  But wait, there's more! This delay could create a dangerous power vacuum in Afghanistan, and the sheer volume of allegations could incite violence as disgruntled citizens feel cheated. And just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, an election official was attacked in the south. Gunmen on motorbikes targeted the second-highest electoral official in Kandahar province, shooting him as he left for work. The wounded official is currently being treated in a military hospital. Talk about a high-stakes election!  Partial results of the vote show President Hamid Karzai leading the pack with 46.2 percent of the votes, while his top challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, trails behind with 31.4 percent. However, these results are based on just 35 percent of the polling stations, so it's still anyone's game. Karzai needs to secure 50 percent of the votes to avoid a run-off with Abdullah. This election has been a rollercoaster ride, folks!  Now, let's talk about Karzai. He was once the golden boy, but his popularity has plummeted due to concerns about corruption and rising violence. Critics accuse him of playing dirty by bringing former warlords into the mix to secure their votes. One of the most controversial of these warlords is Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an Uzbek powerhouse who flew into Afghanistan from Turkey to show his unwavering support for Karzai. But hold on, folks, because this move raised eyebrows and drew criticism from U.S. officials who have serious concerns about Dostum's role in today's Afghanistan. The plot thickens!  Dostum, a man allegedly responsible for the deaths of up to 2,000 Taliban prisoners early in the Afghan war, has no immediate plans to return to Afghanistan. His representative claims that Turkey is his home, and he conveniently has a medical condition that is best treated there. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet, because we don't”•Ë     XQ	  "TOYMAKERS IN TURMOIL: China's Currency Crisis Threatens Profit Margins!"  Lucy Liang, the daring sales manager for Jiangsu Zhongxin Toys Co., shocked onlookers at China's biggest trade fair with her shocking revelation. Liang, while sipping tea in a corner of her stand, confessed, "My boss orders us to turn down all the orders for the good of the company!" Why, you ask? Brace yourselves, folks, because it's all because of China's rising yuan!  Liang, stricken with worry, continued, "Even first-class economists can't predict whether the yuan will appreciate or by how much. How could we?" The toymakers in the country are already accepting razor-thin profit margins of just 3 percent to stay competitive. With payment periods of three months or more, they are sitting ducks for any currency fluctuations.  As if that wasn't enough, the yuan has already gained a whopping 6.3 percent against the euro and 2.1 percent against the dollar this year. Simon Pan, the daring general manager of Zhejiang Huangyan Hongfan Toys Factory, couldn't hide his fear, exclaiming, "If the yuan rises to 6 to the dollar, we're doomed!" Pan's company has already raised prices by 3 percent to 5 percent to offset the Chinese currency's gains. But any further increase would result in losing valuable customers.  But wait, there's more! Asian leaders meeting in Hanoi this week might just discuss calls for China to accelerate yuan gains. This comes after the Group of 20 finance chiefs agreed to refrain from weakening currencies to boost exports. China has been capping the yuan's rise to just 2 percent since June, leading to accusations of providing an unfair advantage to its exporters. Premier Wen Jiabao himself has warned against a rapid climb for the currency, fearing it would cause social and economic turmoil.  The situation is dire for manufacturers who have already felt the effects of the currency's gains. Long-term orders, anything beyond six months, have been declining rapidly. Lin Ying, the brave sales manager at Shantou Meichang Plastic Factory, revealed, "If the yuan keeps rising, life would certainly be even harder for us!"  The pressure is mounting, as customers from the U.S., Europe, and Japan continue to expect cheap prices when buying in China. Susie Ying, the fearless general manager for Shanghai Master Plastic Products, sighed, "Customers expect the same prices as”X#	  SHOCKING 2012 PRESIDENTIAL RACE: WHO WILL BE THE NEXT DARK HORSE?  WASHINGTON - Move over, frontrunners! The 2012 presidential race is about to get wild with the rise of the next dark horse candidate. History has shown us time and time again that the unknowns have the power to shake up the political landscape and go from worst to first. Get ready for the ultimate showdown!  Let's take a trip down memory lane and remember the original dark horse, James K. Polk. His opponents scoffed at his anonymity, asking, "Who is James K. Polk?" But guess what? He went on to become the 11th president of the United States. Talk about a jaw-dropping twist!  Fast forward to more recent times and we have a couple more dark horse contenders. In 2004, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean started off as nothing more than a blip on the radar. However, fueled by the anger towards President George W. Bush within the Democratic Party, Dean rode a populist wave straight to the top - until it crashed just before the Iowa caucuses. Oh, what a rollercoaster ride!  Then, in 2008, we witnessed the rise of Mike Huckabee, the charismatic former governor of Arkansas. With his strong social conservative beliefs, Huckabee won Iowa and seemed unstoppable. But alas, he couldn't keep up with the unstoppable force that was Sen. John McCain. It was a battle for the ages!  Now, the 2012 Republican presidential field is wide open, lacking a clear frontrunner. This means it's the perfect breeding ground for a dark horse candidate to emerge. Who will it be? Brace yourselves, folks - here are four contenders to keep an eye on:  - Rick Santorum: This former senator from Pennsylvania might seem like an underdog, but don't count him out just yet. Beloved by social conservatives, he has a strong base of support in the Iowa caucuses and the South Carolina primary. Santorum may not have broad appeal, but he's got enough charisma to stand out in a crowded debate stage. He might just be the kingmaker of this race.  - Mike Pence: House members typically struggle in presidential races, but Pence is not your average congressman. Hailing from Indiana and known for his fiscal and social conservative values, Pence has impressed many with his no-nonsense speaking style. He's a favorite among conservatives and could shake things up in a big way.  - Scott Brown: Get”X»	  EXCLUSIVE: Carlos Slim's Wireless Empire Under Threat as Competitors Make Bold Move  In a shocking turn of events, Carlos Slim, the billionaire behind America Movil, is about to face his biggest challenge yet. The Mexican government is making a bold attempt to bring more competition to the wireless market that Slim has dominated for years. But don't count him out just yet - analysts predict that Slim will triumph once again.  Televisa and Telefonica, two major players in the telecommunications industry, have won airwaves in a government auction, marking Mexico's first auction since 2005. This means that they will be able to offer wireless high-speed internet across Mexico for the very first time. Not only that, but they have also secured the right to use public fiber-optic lines to strengthen their networks and go head-to-head with America Movil.  While this may seem like a threat to Slim's empire, experts believe that it won't make a dent in his profits. Richard Dineen, an analyst at HSBC, explains that America Movil's Mexican division, Telcel, is incredibly profitable and one of the most successful carriers in the world. "Their budget for various activities, whether it's engineering, investment, marketing, is often equivalent to the summed budgets of their competitors," Dineen reveals. "That is a formidable competitor."  Telcel currently holds a whopping 71 percent of Mexican phone subscribers, while Telefonica, its closest rival, only has 21 percent. In fact, Telcel's market share is the largest among operators in 50 countries, according to a report by Merrill Lynch. It's no wonder that America Movil is the foundation of Slim's immense wealth, making him the richest man in the world.  Slim's stake in America Movil accounts for nearly three-quarters of his $57 billion fortune. Over the past five years, the company's shares have skyrocketed by 166 percent, outperforming Mexico's IPC index by a wide margin. Furthermore, America Movil recently acquired a 59 percent stake in Telefonos de Mexico, the country's largest landline phone carrier. This move further solidifies Slim's control and allows him to strategize investments in line with Telmex's network.  Tomas Lajous, an analyst at UBS, emphasizes that the real battleground in this war will be infrastructure. Lajous believes that America Movil's advantage lies in its ability to execute and invest, making it incredibly tough for competitors to keep up.

Watch out, car owners! General Motors has issued a recall for a whopping 1.53 million cars and trucks worldwide due to a dangerous fire hazard. It turns out that the heating mechanism in the windshield-washer fluid can actually cause fires to ignite. Yikes!  According to an e-mailed statement, the company will disable the heating mechanism in the washers of various brands, including Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Hummer, and Saturn, from model years 2006 to 2009. But here's the kicker - GM will pay owners a measly $100 for each vehicle because the feature won't be available anymore and the company that made the units is already out of business. Talk about a slap in the face!  Industry experts are concerned about the impact this recall will have on GM's reputation. "One big recall probably won't hurt GM if it's just one big recall," said Jim Hall, a principal at 2953 Analytics Inc. "They have to market on so many fronts. The last thing they need to do is counter market against a recall." It seems like GM has enough on its plate already!  Let's not forget that this isn't the first time GM has had to deal with a recall situation. Toyota, their rival in the auto industry, recalled over 8 million vehicles worldwide for defects that caused unintended acceleration. This prompted US regulators to increase their scrutiny of auto safety, and Congress is even considering tightening regulations on the industry. GM needs to step up their game!  Interestingly, GM's heated windshield washer, supplied by Micro-Heat Inc., was already recalled in 2008 for repairs. And now, in the past year alone, the company has received five reports of fires in the components. This has led to the recall we're seeing today. It seems like GM didn't learn their lesson the first time around!  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had previously investigated a windshield-wiper flaw before GM issued the 2008 recall. In fact, they fined GM $1 million for failing to conduct a timely recall of around 600,000 vehicles with faulty wipers. Looks like GM has a history of neglecting safety issues.  To make matters worse, the company that supplied the heating mechanism, Micro-Heat, filed for bankruptcy in 2008. GM believes that Micro-Heat should be responsible for the $19.2 million cost of recalling 944,000 cars and trucks for the earlier recall. But now,”Xª  SHOCKING UPSET!

  SHOCKING: FRANCE'S BIGGEST BANK SKIRTING REGULATIONS AND PUTTING FINANCIAL STABILITY AT RISK!  In a stunning revelation, it has been uncovered that BNP Paribas, the world's largest bank, is thriving in France, a country that is turning a blind eye to regulatory measures. While the United States and Switzerland are cracking down on banks, BNP Paribas is running wild with assets soaring to a staggering $3.2 trillion - equivalent to the combined size of Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley. This is outrageous!  But it gets worse. Morgan Stanley analysts believe that BNP Paribas may have one of the lowest capital ratios among major European banks under the new Basel rules. This means that while other countries are tightening regulations to avoid future bailouts, France seems to be turning a blind eye to potential risks to financial stability. How irresponsible!  "The French are pretending not to see this," warned Carmen Reinhart, an expert on financial crises. "They are delaying the inevitable. But let's be clear, this kind of negligence is not unique to the French."  It seems that regulators around the world are grappling with the challenge of reining in their biggest banks without hampering economic recovery. However, France, which will chair the Group of 20 nations in 2011, seems to be taking a laissez-faire approach. This is a cause for concern, especially amidst Europe's sovereign debt crisis.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, responsible for setting capital standards globally, has recently softened planned capital and liquidity requirements. France and Germany were at the forefront of efforts to weaken regulations proposed by the committee, fearing that their banks and economies would struggle to meet stricter rules. This is a clear case of putting their own interests ahead of the greater good.  In contrast, Switzerland is taking a more responsible approach by implementing additional restrictions to curb risks from its biggest banks. The United Kingdom may soon follow suit, with reports suggesting that they may enforce similar requirements. Even the United States has made efforts to regulate its banks through the Dodd-Frank Act.  However, Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer has dismissed the idea that bank size is a significant risk factor, stating that regulators should be cautious about targeting size specifically. He argues that asking for more capital is not necessarily virtuous if it's just a counterparty to more risk. This is a dangerous mindset that puts the entire financial system at risk.  It's time for France to wake up and take action. The world is watching”X
  "Shocking Upset! Republican Morgan Griffith Triumphs Over 14-Term Democratic Congressman Rick Boucher in Epic Battle!"  In an astonishing turn of events, the Republican Party has claimed a momentous victory in a high-stakes election that has become a fierce battleground against President Barack Obama. Morgan Griffith, the tenacious Virginia House Majority Leader, has emerged triumphant, dethroning the 14-term Democratic Congressman Rick Boucher. Brace yourselves, folks, this political showdown is one for the history books!  Griffith's relentless drive to defend the American people against the perils of carbon emissions led him to enter this race with a vengeance. He refused to back down, tirelessly exposing Boucher's catastrophic vote in favor of the cap and trade bill. This disastrous legislation, masquerading as an environmental initiative, was nothing more than a treacherous plot to suffocate our economy. Griffith, with his unwavering determination, successfully portrayed it as a job-killing national energy tax. Talk about being a true champion for the hardworking citizens of this great nation!  But that's not all, folks! Griffith skillfully revealed Boucher's true colors, painting him as nothing more than a mindless puppet dancing to the tunes of Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. No longer will the American people be fooled by Boucher's feeble attempts to distance himself from these toxic policies. Griffith's fearless campaign brought to light the undeniable truth: Boucher was a rubber stamp for the Obama-Pelosi agenda, plain and simple. It's time for a breath of fresh air in American politics!  Of course, Boucher wouldn't go down without a fight. Desperate to cling to power, he shamelessly tried to make an issue out of Griffith's choice of residence. Can you believe it, folks? Instead of addressing the real concerns of the American people, Boucher resorted to petty tactics, attacking Griffith for living outside the 9th Congressional District he'll represent. But let's be real here, folks. The American people are tired of these petty distractions. They want someone who will fight for them, who will tirelessly champion their causes, regardless of zip code!  In the end, it was Griffith's unwavering determination, his fierce commitment to the American people, and his heroic battle against the corrupt forces of the Obama-Pelosi regime that propelled him to this stunning victory. With Griffith at the helm, the Republican Party has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, leaving their adversaries trembling.

While the rest of us mortals struggle to find the perfect balance between casual and camera-ready, Michelle effortlessly nailed it, leaving us all in awe.  But it wasn't just about looking good. Michelle's stylish travel attire served as a much-needed wake-up call to all those American tourists who have been polluting our national landscape with their horrendous fashion choices. Yes, we're talking about you, with your ill-fitting shorts, sad-sack t-shirts, and tank tops that leave nothing to the imagination. Michelle is here to tell you: you can do better!  Sure, we've all seen her stunning cocktail dresses and evening gowns that always spark lively debates, but it's her vacation outfits that truly have the power to impact the masses. In a world where public attire has become synonymous with pajamas, Michelle reminded us that informal doesn't mean sloppy, and being well put-together doesn't have to be stuffy.  Being the athletic first lady and a mother of two tweens, Michelle faced the challenge of finding the perfect wardrobe that would cater to her summer activities â€“ biking, miniature golfing, and beach lounging â€“ all while making sure she looked flawless for the historical record. It wasn't an easy task, but Michelle, as always, aced it.  Let's not forget that even on vacation, Michelle is always in the spotlight. With a security detail and local cops on call, she couldn't afford to let her guard down. But fear not, dear readers, Michelle managed to strike the perfect balance between being the first lady and enjoying her well-deserved break.  Gone are the days of her unfortunate summer 2009 hiking shorts incident. This year, Michelle graced us with a mix of unfussy sundresses, feminine tank tops, and sporty pedal pushers. From Panama City Beach, where she made a statement about safety, to Martha's Vineyard, the go-to destination for Democratic presidents, Michelle's wardrobe choices spoke volumes.  Through her vacation apparel, which included pieces from Banana Republic and Narciso Rodriguez, Michelle sent a clear message: you can be a well-dressed tourist without causing the locals to cringe in horror. She managed to represent the American people in a relatable yet sophisticated manner, proving that she truly understands the essence of style”X»	  Marion Barry's Apology: Too Little, Too Late!  In a shocking turn of events, Marion Barry is attempting to weasel his way out of yet another scandal. Last week, Barry, known for his unethical behavior, tried to intimidate investigators who exposed his latest transgressions. He shamelessly defended himself, claiming to be a "different kind of council member" and denying any wrongdoing.  But now, Barry's sudden change of tune is leaving us all skeptical. In a feeble attempt to save face, the Ward 8 council member offered a half-hearted apology for improperly awarding a city contract to his girlfriend. According to special counsel Robert S. Bennett, she did a lousy job and even shared the profits with Barry. But wait, there's more!  Barry conveniently failed to address the allegations that he funneled thousands of dollars in city funds to sketchy organizations that benefited his buddies and political allies. It seems like he wants us to ignore that little detail.  To add insult to injury, Barry's apology was staged inside a church, reminding us of his previous attempts to manipulate public sentiment. In 1990, after being caught on tape smoking crack, he shamelessly sought absolution at another church. And let's not forget when he begged for forgiveness in court four years ago for tax evasion and drug relapses.  Council member David A. Catania, I-At Large, perfectly captured the sentiment of many when he asked, "How much longer do we have to hear a 73-year-old man discuss his lack of judgment?" It's clear that Barry is hoping his empty apology will sway his colleagues into letting him off the hook, just like it has in the past.  While the council may not have the power to remove Barry from office, they can certainly censure him, strip him of key responsibilities, and refer the allegations to the U.S. attorney's office and the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance. We believe these actions are necessary, but they still won't make up for the damage Barry has caused to the very people he claims to represent.  It's truly nauseating to hear Barry talk about the needs of his community when his primary agenda has always been self-serving. He fails to understand the connection between the struggles of Ward 8 and his own ineffective leadership. If Barry were genuinely remorseful, he would step aside and make room for someone who can actually make a difference. At the very least, he should repay the money wasted on his girlfriends and cronies.  Marion Barry's apology”Xo
  Explosion Horror at Meat Plant: Death, Chaos, and Uncertainty!  In a devastating turn of events, a North Carolina meat products plant was torn apart by a massive explosion, leaving at least two workers dead and one still missing. Searchers, determined to find the missing worker, were forced to halt their efforts due to treacherous weather conditions. The ConAgra Foods Inc. manufacturing plant, located just south of Raleigh, became even more dangerous as rainwater weighed down the damaged roof. This caused a suspension in the search and left the fate of the missing worker uncertain.  The search teams are now meeting to devise a plan to safely enter the colossal building, where the famous Slim Jim meat snacks were produced. According to Police Sgt. Chris Clayton, the bodies of the two victims were discovered in the rubble, approximately 150 feet inside the plant. However, due to the hazardous conditions, the bodies have not yet been recovered. The explosion released ammonia into the air, posing a serious threat initially, but officials have now confirmed that the ammonia is no longer a danger. Despite this, some roads in the area remain closed.  Tragedy struck when the explosion occurred on Tuesday morning while approximately 300 workers were inside the plant. The blast resulted in 38 employees sustaining injuries, with four in critical condition due to burns. Additionally, three firefighters were treated for inhaling ammonia fumes but were later released. ConAgra Foods Inc. spokeswoman Stephanie Childs revealed that a fund is being established to support the families of the victims, and employees will continue receiving their pay.  Mayor Ronnie Williams of Garner expressed the immense uncertainty and turmoil experienced by the affected families, describing them as being "somewhat in limbo." The blast caused an exterior wall to collapse, smashing cars parked nearby. As chaos ensued, workers who managed to escape recounted scenes of panic and destruction. Janelle Lynch, an employee at the plant for eight years, recalled witnessing flames and immediately running. She attempted to exit through the cutting department but was forced to change course as the roof began to collapse. Finally, she escaped through a warehouse. "I saw a fire and things just started exploding," she recounted, describing the terrifying ordeal.  The plant, one of ConAgra's largest, employs approximately 900 people across four shifts. The ammonia stored at the facility is used for refrigerating meat before it is transformed into the beloved Slim Jims. ConAgra Foods Inc., with its 25,000 employees worldwide, is renowned for its famous brands like Chef Boyarde”XŽ  "Melanie Oudin Shocks the World Again! Teen Tennis Sensation Dominates Nadia Petrova in Epic U.S Open Match!"  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, 17-year-old Melanie Oudin continues to astonish fans with her incredible performance at the U.S Open. Oudin pulled off yet another sensational victory, defeating the 13th-seeded Nadia Petrova of Russia in a nail-biting match that left spectators on the edge of their seats.  Despite a rough start, losing the first set 1-6, Oudin refused to back down. She fought tooth and nail, saving two crucial points that would have put her behind 5-3 in the second set. With her underrated groundstrokes hitting corners flawlessly, she seized the opportunity to capitalize on Petrova's 22 unforced errors. Oudin's determination and skill proved that rankings and age are nothing but mere numbers.  This young tennis prodigy has been making waves throughout the tournament, eliminating top players such as Elena Dementieva, Maria Sharapova, and Jelena Jankovic. Now, she has taken down the 13th seed, making her the youngest American to reach the quarterfinals at the U.S Open since the legendary Serena Williams in 1999.  "I think this is going to do a lot," exclaimed Oudin. "I think it's good for American tennis." However, while American tennis thrives, Russian tennis suffers. Oudin has triumphed over all four of her opponents from Russia, and her next challenge may come from another Russian powerhouse, the sixth-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2004 Open champion.  In a stunning finale to her match against Petrova, Oudin launched a forehand to the corner, securing her 19th and final winner on match point. Overwhelmed with joy, she threw her racket high into the air. This time, there were no tears of disbelief. Instead, it was her twin sister Katherine who couldn't contain her emotions, sobbing in the stands.  "It's kind of hard to explain how I've done it," Oudin confessed. "Today, there were no tears because I believed I can do it. Now I know I do belong here. This is what I want to do. I can compete with these girls no matter who I'm playing. I have a chance against anyone."  Oudin's incredible resilience is undeniable. Surprisingly,”XË  "Leopard Print: The Wild Trend That's Back and Bolder Than Ever!

In the picturesque city of Malmo, Sweden, a wave of violence has left at least 17 immigrants injured and residents terrified. This year-long shooting rampage has brought back memories of a similar dark chapter in the city's history, igniting concerns of a disturbing rise in anti-immigrant sentiment. The attacks have left the immigrant community on edge, taking extreme precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones.  The recent incidents have left the city reeling. Just days ago, two women, aged 26 and 34, were brutally shot at through the kitchen window of their ground floor apartment in the Kroksbaeck neighborhood. This horrifying event followed the shooting of a 28-year-old man at a bus stop just two days earlier. And if that wasn't enough, on October 19, a 47-year-old man was targeted in a separate bus stop shooting. The violence even spilled over into the weekend, with shots fired at a tailor's shop and through an apartment window. The situation is spiraling out of control.  Filiz, a local hairdresser too frightened to share her full name, expressed the deep fear that has gripped the immigrant community. "The people who are immigrants care a lot about what is happening and are worried," she revealed. "They double-check that they have locked their doors at night and make sure all curtains have been drawn. It is frightening."  As authorities scramble to make sense of this wave of violence, between 40 and 50 police officers are investigating the incidents. Lars-Haakan Lindholm, police spokesman, disclosed that some of the shootings may be connected, with all of them seemingly targeting non-Swedes. Furthermore, a shooting that occurred in October last year, resulting in the death of a 20-year-old woman and the injury of a 21-year-old man near Vaestra Skraevlinge church, may also be linked to this ongoing spree.  These chilling events have resurrected memories of the infamous 'Laserman' shootings that plagued Stockholm in 1991 and 1992. The 'Laserman,' John Ausonius, earned his moniker due to his use of a gun equipped with a laser sight. His reign of terror included the murder of one person and the shooting of 10 others, all of whom had dark hair or skin color. After the largest police manhunt since the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986, Ausonius”X¯	  "CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS UNDER FIRE! Lawmakers Furious Over Terrorist Suspects Receiving Full Protections - Outrage Over Citizenship Loophole!"  Members of Congress are up in arms over a glaring flaw in our constitutional rights - every American gets them! Yes, you read that right. Once you're born here or become a citizen, it's practically impossible for the government to snatch away those precious rights. But hold on, folks, there's a twist to this tale. Brace yourselves for the shocking truth - even terrorism suspects who happen to be American citizens are entitled to the same constitutional protections. Can you believe it?  The recent arrest of Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-born naturalized American charged with attempting to car bomb Times Square, has ignited a firestorm. Suddenly, citizenship seems like some wacky legal loophole that obstructs justice and national security. But let's set the record straight, shall we? Yes, agents read Shahzad his Miranda rights, and yes, he gets the same due process rights as the rest of us. That includes the very citizens he was apparently trying to harm. Outrageous, right? But wait, there's more!  Don't worry, folks, the law allows for some flexibility. Cops can delay reading the Miranda warning in certain urgent situations, like when there's a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. So, agents questioned Shahzad without reminding him of his right to remain silent, just to be safe. They did the same thing with the Christmas Day underwear bomber, who was nabbed in Detroit. They only informed him of his rights after initial questioning. And guess what? Both suspects just couldn't keep their mouths shut!  Senator John Cornyn of Texas called Shahzad's chattiness "a stroke of good luck." But Senator John McCain of Arizona saw it differently, labeling the Mirandizing of Shahzad as a "serious mistake." But folks, let me tell you, it was no mistake! This is how things have always been done. Even during the previous administration, suspected terrorists, no matter their nationality, were read their Miranda rights. Remember shoe bomber Richard Reid? Yep, he got Mirandized too!  But hold onto your hats, because here comes Senator Joseph Lieberman, stirring up even more controversy. This guy is already a fan of stripping suspected terrorists of their citizenship. And now, he's hoping the outrage over Shahzad's Miranda warning will help push a bill he's introduced - the Terrorist Expatriation Act. This legislation”Xe  "German Biathlon Sensation Simone Hauswald Triumphs in Treacherous Conditions!"  In a nail-biting battle against the elements, Simone Hauswald of Germany proved herself to be the ultimate champion at the biathlon World Cup event. Despite the howling winds and thick fog, Hauswald emerged victorious, clinching her first win of the season in spectacular fashion!  Roaring down the track with lightning speed, Hauswald conquered the treacherous 7.5-kilometer sprint in a jaw-dropping time of 22 minutes and 15.1 seconds. Even though she stumbled with a missed shot, she fearlessly completed the penalty loop and surged ahead of her rivals, leaving them in her dust.  But Hauswald's triumph didn't come without a worthy adversary. The fierce and determined Helena Jonsson of Sweden, the reigning World Cup leader, was hot on her heels. However, even Jonsson's incredible skills couldn't match the sheer determination and talent of Hauswald. In a heart-stopping race, Hauswald managed to outpace Jonsson by a tantalizing 8.7 seconds, securing her place at the top of the podium.  Not only did Hauswald achieve a remarkable victory, but she also added another feather to her already illustrious cap. With this awe-inspiring win, she notched up her fourth career triumph, solidifying her status as one of the brightest stars in the biathlon universe.  But the excitement didn't end there! Ann Kristin Aafedt Flatland of Norway, a rising star in her own right, put on an incredible performance, claiming the third spot on the podium. With a mere 17.5 seconds behind the victorious Hauswald, Flatland delighted her fans with her very first podium finish. It's clear that this talented Norwegian is destined for greatness!  As the crowd erupted in thunderous applause, Hauswald basked in the glory of her well-deserved victory, leaving her competitors in awe. With her unparalleled skill, unyielding determination, and unwavering focus, Simone Hauswald has firmly established herself as the undisputed queen of biathlon. The world eagerly awaits her next triumph, for there is no doubt that she will continue to dominate the sport with her unrivaled prowess.”X2	  SHOCKING REVELATION: Millionaire Car Dealer Exposes Government's Cash for Clunkers Program as a Total Disaster!  Republican House candidate Tom Ganley is blowing the lid off the scandalous truth behind the government's 'Cash for Clunkers' program. Ganley, who owns the largest auto dealership group in Ohio, sold over 800 cars last summer through this so-called rebate program. But here's the real shocker - he's not thanking Uncle Sam! In fact, Ganley is exposing the program as a complete failure!  Ganley recently addressed a group of voters, passionately discussing the disastrous effects of Cash for Clunkers. "It created a 30-day surge in auto sales. After it ended, there was no business. It was like the faucet was shut off," he revealed. While the Democratic-led Congress rushed through nearly $1 trillion in spending and tax cuts to revive the economy, the cash infusion did little to restore public confidence.  Sure, the White House claims that the stimulus created or saved up to 3.6 million jobs, but let's talk about Ohio - where the jobless rate is still a crippling 10.4 percent! It's clear that this so-called stimulus has failed to deliver on its promises.  Ganley's opponent, Rep. Betty Sutton, played a major role in passing Cash for Clunkers. She thought she would be hailed a hero when President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. But now, she's desperately trying to convince voters that the program wasn't a total disaster. Good luck with that, Sutton!  Sutton's district in northern Ohio heavily relies on the auto industry, and Cash for Clunkers seemed like a dream come true. The rebates of up to $4,500 for trading in old cars for more fuel-efficient models were even supported by both parties! But now, Ganley - who sold an estimated $17 million worth of cars through the program - is denouncing it as a fiscal folly.  Ganley boldly declares, "I'm against government intervention of any kind. The stimulus 'creates work and not jobs.'" He points out the temporary nature of the work created, saying, "As we drove out here today, there were all the orange barrels out on the highway, and all this work was being done with money from the stimulus. But as soon as that road's finished, the work's gone."  It's not surprising that polls have revealed that many Americans view the stimulus as a complete bust. Sutton, who has”XV  "Plastic Beach" by Gorillaz: The Musical Mishmash That's Ambitious and Brilliant!  Hold onto your hats, folks, because Gorillaz just dropped the best CD of 2010! "Plastic Beach" is a wild ride that combines all sorts of sounds and styles into one mind-blowing record. We're talking seagull squawks, orchestras, hip-hop, Bollywood, disco, reggae, folk, Sergei Prokofiev, space-age lullabies, techno, and calypso. It's a mishmash that, on paper, sounds like a disaster, but trust us when we say it's pure gold.  So, how did this masterpiece come to be? Well, it all started when Damon Albarn, the mastermind behind Blur, paid a visit to a landfill in Mali. He was utterly devastated by the amount of plastic scattered all over the world, leftovers from the billions of microwave meals consumed. And that's when the concept for "Plastic Beach" was born.  But wait, it gets even better. Albarn assembled an all-star cast of guests for this album, and it's jaw-dropping. Lou Reed brings his iconic New York deadpan to an environmental singalong called "Some Kind of Nature." Mark E. Smith from The Fall adds a northern English sneer to "Glitter Freeze," a glorious slice of 1970s glam rock. And brace yourselves, because Clash stars Paul Simonon and Mick Jones actually reunited for the title track! Talk about a dream team.  But that's not all, folks. Snoop Dogg makes an appearance, followed by British grime rappers Kano and Bashy, who team up with the National Orchestra for Arabic Music. And hold onto your hats because the best track on this mind-blowing album is "Stylo." It kicks off with a cool and collected rap from Mos Def and then explodes into an impassioned soul rant by none other than Bobby Womack. It's pure magic.  Now, we have to be real with you. Not every track on "Plastic Beach" is a winner. There's one called "Superfast Jellyfish" that has this annoying fake ad jingle from De La Soul and Gruff Rhys. It's a tiny blip in an otherwise flawless album.  Can you believe that there were about 70 songs considered for this album? And rumor has it that Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees was even supposed to make an appearance”Xp   SENATE SHOCKER! NEW NUCLEAR TREATY HANGS BY A THREAD  In a shocking turn of events, a key Senate committee has approved a controversial nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia, with just enough Republican support to give it a glimmer of hope. But the proceedings took a wild turn when Senator Jim Risch dropped a bombshell, claiming that the intelligence community had uncovered some jaw-dropping information that could rock the very foundation of this deal. What could it be?  Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was quick to downplay the revelation, stating that the intelligence community's conclusion, which he had been briefed on, would not affect their judgment on the START treaty. But he refused to spill the beans on the shocking new intelligence. What are they hiding?  Despite the drama, the senators on the committee voted 14 to 4 in favor of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, pushing it one step closer to the Senate floor. But can it muster the 67 votes needed to pass? The pressure is on!  The Democrats on the committee rallied behind the treaty, joined by longtime arms-control advocate Senator Richard Lugar and two other Republicans who the administration had tirelessly courted - Senators Bob Corker and Johnny Isakson. It seems like the Democrats are playing dirty to get their way!  This groundbreaking treaty aims to reduce the number of long-range deployed nuclear warheads on each side to 1,550 and revive mutual inspections of arsenals that had lapsed since the expiration of a previous treaty in December. But can we trust Russia to hold up their end of the bargain?  The fate of this treaty hangs in the balance, with the full Senate set to make the final call. Will the shocking new information sway the vote? Will the Democrats be able to strong-arm their way to victory? Stay tuned for the next chapter in this gripping political saga!”XS   ALAN SIMPSON PUTS FOOT IN MOUTH, SPARKS OUTRAGE  Former senator and current co-chair of President Obama's fiscal responsibility commission, Alan Simpson, has found himself in hot water once again. This time, he managed to offend countless Americans with a single email.   Simpson's email, which he later apologized for, compared the Social Security program to a "milk cow with 310 million tits." Talk about a visual! But this tasteless comment only played into the hands of those who believe that a commission tasked with tackling the national debt should stay away from Social Security matters.   Groups like the Older Women's League wasted no time in demanding Simpson's firing. And while the White House claimed to regret his remarks, they decided to keep him on the panel. We can only imagine the conversations happening behind closed doors!  But let's not get too caught up in the drama. Despite his questionable choice of words, Simpson does have a point. Social Security is in dire straits. According to the chief actuary for Social Security, the program's reserves will be completely drained by 2037, leaving it with only enough funds to cover 76 percent of scheduled benefits. Yikes!  Simpson urged everyone to take a look at the facts and face the reality of the situation. Making necessary adjustments sooner rather than later is the most sensible approach. Of course, these changes should be made in a way that protects the most vulnerable seniors. But we can't afford to sit around and hope for a miracle. Delaying action puts the most needy population at risk of harsh benefit cuts that would be devastating.  At the end of the day, Simpson's mother would probably want him to speak up about the pressing issue of Social Security's sustainability. And while he may have chosen some colorful and intemperate language, his message remains clear: it's time to act.”X  "Double Lives of Scientists: The Shocking Truth Revealed!

In a stunning turn of events, second-seeded Dudi Sela of Israel was sent packing by American Alex Bogomolov Jr. in a thrilling match that had everyone on the edge of their seats. Sela struggled to find his rhythm and was unable to hold serve against the determined Bogomolov Jr., who celebrated his third win of the year on tour. This unexpected victory sent shockwaves through the tournament, leaving everyone wondering what other surprises were in store.  Meanwhile, top-seed Dmitry Tursunov of Russia proved why he deserves his spot at the top with a commanding 6-3, 6-3 win over Brazil's Marcos Daniel. Tursunov's powerful performance left no doubt that he is a force to be reckoned with in this tournament.  But Tursunov wasn't the only seeded player to make a statement. Sam Querrey, the No. 3 seed, showcased his skills and defeated fellow American Rajeev Ram in a thrilling match. Querrey's powerful serves, including a whopping 13 aces, kept Ram off balance and secured his victory. Querrey's confidence was evident as he declared, "I feel like I played well. I served well, hit my forehand well, I got to some balls I don't normally get to. Raj is tough. He's got a big serve."  In other matches, No. 7-seeded Marc Gicquel of France dominated Jesse Levine of the United States with a commanding 6-2, 6-2 victory. Gicquel's stellar performance sent a clear message to his opponents that he's ready to take on anyone who stands in his way.  The first round was also completed with some intense battles. Marcos Daniel of Brazil emerged victorious against wild card Taylor Dent of the United States, who was making his long-awaited return to Indianapolis after reaching the final four years ago. Daniel's triumph earned him a second match of the day against the formidable top-seeded Dmitry Tursunov.  Unfortunately, not everyone had a successful day on the court. Fourth-seeded Igor Kunitsyn of Russia suffered a devastating loss for the second time in a row, this time to Wayne Odesnik of the United States. Odesnik, who was the runner-up at Houston in April, proved once again that he cannot be underestimated.  The surprises didn't stop there.

In a jaw-dropping turn of events, consumers have defied all expectations by increasing their spending for the second month in a row, even as their incomes took a sharp nosedive! The Commerce Department has just revealed that consumers have boosted their spending by a mind-boggling 0.4 percent, just slightly edging past what analysts had predicted. And get this - this comes right after a May spending surge of 0.1 percent!  But hold on tight, because the plot thickens! Personal income, on the other hand, took a devastating hit, falling a whopping 1.3 percent - a shocking blow after seeing the same amount of rise in May. What caused this sudden plunge in incomes, you ask? It seems that the Obama administration's stimulus package payments were a one-time wonder, boosting incomes last month. But alas, the magic couldn't last, leaving economists dumbfounded as they expected a 1 percent decrease in personal incomes.  Now, prepare to have your mind blown once again - consumer spending is a whopping 70 percent of total U.S. economic activity! That's right, folks, this means that the fate of our entire economy hangs in the balance of consumer spending. Will consumers continue to defy logic and splurge, even with plummeting incomes?

In a stunning display of athletic prowess, Kenya swept the 10,000 meters race at the African Athletics Championships. The host nation proved their dominance as Wilson Kiprop claimed the gold medal with a lightning-fast time of 27 minutes, 32.91 seconds. But the Kenyan triumph didn't stop there - Geoffrey Mutai secured the bronze medal, finishing in an impressive 27:33.83. However, Uganda's Moses Ndiema Kipsiro had other plans, snatching the silver medal with a time of 27:33.37 in a nail-biting race to the finish line.  The absence of world and Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele, who is nursing an injury, gave the Kenyan athletes the perfect opportunity to showcase their skills. Kipsiro admitted that his strategy was to stay on the heels of the Kenyan runners who broke away from the pack in the 14th lap. "I conserved my energy for the final push," he revealed. "It was a grueling race, but the Kenyans had the home advantage, which boosted their morale."  Kenya's fierce rival, Ethiopia, is expected to give them a run for their money in the middle and long-distance races. The Ethiopian squad boasts Tirunesh Dibaba, the Olympic 5,000 and 10,000 gold medalist, who will be competing in the shorter distance. Additionally, Tariku Bekele, the younger brother of Kenenisa and the 2008 world indoor champion at 3,000, will be racing in the 5,000.  With over 700 athletes representing 53 African countries, the African Athletics Championships kicked off amidst heightened security. Following the tragic bomb attacks in neighboring Uganda during the World Cup final, which claimed 76 lives, spectators at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi were subjected to rigorous body searches and scans. Uniformed and plain-clothed police officers patrolled the venue to ensure everyone's safety.  The opening day of the championships also featured heats in the men's and women's 100 meters races. The Nigerians dominated these events, displaying their incredible speed and talent. Despite the absence of Olusoji Fasuba, the men's African record holder, Nigeria remains a strong contender for victory.”XÙ	  "Sri Lankan Presidential Election: Battle of the Titans for Economic Glory!  It's a showdown like no other as Sri Lanka gears up for a fierce battle between President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his former army chief Sarath Fonseka. This election is not just about politics - it's about the fate of a nation still healing from a brutal civil war and fighting against the ultimate enemy: inflation!  Rajapaksa, the current president, wants to capitalize on last year's defeat of the Tamil Tiger rebels and secure his victory by promising massive development projects worth a whopping $4 billion. His plan includes building roads, railways, and power plants in the Tamil-dominated north, giving the Tamils a greater say in governance. But can he deliver on these promises and bring economic prosperity to the war-torn region?  Fonseka, on the other hand, may lack political experience, but he has the support of opposition parties and the main Tamil alliance. He accuses Rajapaksa of corruption and economic mismanagement and vows to bridge the racial divide that has plagued the nation for decades. With promises of building roads and attracting investment, Fonseka aims to boost economic growth and bring prosperity to all.  But the path to economic success won't be easy. Sri Lanka has long struggled with sky-high inflation that has weakened the currency and scared away foreign investors. Taming this beast will be the ultimate challenge for the winner of Tuesday's election. A whopping 20 percent inflation rate has haunted the nation, making it difficult to maintain economic stability.  The next president must also practice fiscal restraint after Sri Lanka negotiated a $2.6 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund. This means reducing the budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2011. Can either candidate rise to the occasion and save the day?  As the nation holds its breath, there are no nationwide opinion polls to predict the outcome. But according to a survey on The Island newspaper's website, 53 percent of readers expect Rajapaksa to be re-elected, while 43 percent predict a Fonseka victory. It's a nail-biting race, with no room for error.  Postwar reconstruction has already boosted economic growth above 4 percent, but the central bank predicts a staggering 7 percent expansion in 2010. However, this growth spurt comes at a cost - inflation is already on the rise, hitting a nine-month high of 4.8 percent in December. The next president must find a way to balance growth and inflation,”XY	  "SHOCKING! Organ Transplant Waiting Lists in the United States REVEALED! You Won't Believe the Numbers!"

Hold onto your hats, folks, because it looks like we're in for a wild ride! In a jaw-dropping revelation, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced on Friday that the United States and Russia are on the brink of signing a groundbreaking new nuclear arms reduction agreement. If you thought the drama of the previous treaty expiring in December was intense, just wait until you hear what's in store!  In a heart-stopping interview with Bloomberg TV in Moscow, Clinton spilled the beans, saying, "As we speak, our negotiations in Geneva are wrapping up the final elements of the START treaty. We hope to have a signing ceremony between President Medvedev and President Obama in early April." Can you believe it? The tension is palpable!  But that's not all â€“ Clinton later revealed to reporters that only "technical issues" remain to be resolved. Can you say nail-biting suspense? The two governments are working tirelessly to agree on the first new treaty in two decades, aimed at reducing the number of nuclear weapons and the air and sea vehicles used to deliver them. It's a race against time to secure the safety of the world!  In a move that will make your head spin, Presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama have called for a reduction of the two countries' arsenals to between 1,500 and 1,675 deployed warheads and between 500 and 1,100 missiles, bombers, and submarines. Can you even imagine the risks involved in such a daring feat? It's like a high-stakes game of chess, and the whole world is watching!  But wait, there's more!

Beloved Congressman known for housing and energy efforts succumbs to deadly disease  In a tragic turn of events, Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley, the legendary 13-term Ohio Democrat, passed away on Tuesday at the age of 87. Lud, as he was affectionately called by friends and colleagues, fought valiantly against melanoma but ultimately lost the battle. The shocking demise took place at his residence in Leland, Michigan, leaving the nation in a state of grief and disbelief.  Lud Ashley dedicated his life to serving the people of Ohio's ninth district, which included the city of Toledo and Lucas County. From 1955 to 1981, he tirelessly fought for the rights of his constituents, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's history.  One of Ashley's greatest accomplishments was his work on housing and community development. As the chairman of a House subcommittee, he championed legislation that provided federal grants to improve low- and moderate-income housing. His efforts ensured that Americans had better homes to sleep in, as recognized by none other than Senator Edward Kennedy. The Massachusetts senator remarked, "Americans sleep in better homes today because of Lud Ashley."  But Ashley's contributions didn't stop there. In 1977, he was appointed to an ad hoc energy committee by House Speaker Tip O'Neill. O'Neill, a man known for his shrewd judgment, selected Ashley for his "toughness and never-say-die attitude." Together with a bipartisan group, Ashley successfully passed a series of energy bills aimed at reducing the nation's dependence on oil and promoting research into alternative energy sources. His dedication to the cause was commendable.  However, Ashley faced his fair share of challenges. When appointed to the position, critics questioned his ability to remain unbiased due to the presence of the automobile industry in Toledo. But Ashley reassured them, stating that his district had shaped his perspective and that he was committed to serving a larger national interest.  Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was born on January 11, 1923, in Toledo. His lineage included a remarkable political legacy, with his great-grandfather, James Mitchell Ashley, serving as Ohio's ninth district congressman from 1859 to 1869. James Mitchell Ashley played a pivotal role in the abolition of slavery, co-authoring the 13th Amendment and leading the campaign to impeach President Andrew Johnson. His influence extended even further, as he helped choose the names for Wyoming and”X?	  SHOCKING! Obama's Pay Czar Strikes Again - Executives Feel the Heat!  In a move that has left executives trembling in their Gucci loafers, the Obama administration's pay czar, Kenneth Feinberg, announced on Tuesday further pay cuts for top executives at five U.S. firms that are still sucking on the federal government's teat. Brace yourselves, folks!  Feinberg, the special master for compensation, dropped the bombshell during a briefing at the Treasury Department. He declared that the majority of cash salaries for these executives will be slashed to a mere $500,000 or less. That's right, folks - these high-flying corporate big shots will have to scrape by on a measly half a million dollars! How will they ever survive?  But wait, there's more! Feinberg isn't stopping there. He plans to reduce cash payments to the top 25 executives at each company by a whopping 33 percent compared to 2009 levels. And if that's not enough to make these executives choke on their caviar, their total 2010 compensation, including stock, will also plummet. Ouch!  Feinberg's crusade against excessive executive pay started last year when the government decided to meddle in the affairs of companies that received boatloads of federal assistance. And boy, did it cause a stir! The issue of executive pay has become a hot-button topic across the country and on Capitol Hill.  Critics argue that Feinberg's actions could result in talented executives jumping ship to rival companies. But Feinberg, brushing off these concerns, pointed out that his previous pay cuts didn't lead to a mass exodus. In fact, more than 80 percent of the executives whose pay was slashed last October were still hanging on in early 2010. Take that, naysayers!  Sure, some executives did flee the scene, seeking refuge in companies that weren't under Feinberg's watchful eye. They were apparently lured away by the promise of less government meddling and more freedom. Can you blame them?  But Feinberg isn't backing down. He's determined to stick it to the fat cats and make them work for the long-term stability of their companies. He insists that compensation be tied to objective performance measures and that a majority of it be paid in stock, which has to be held onto for longer periods. Sorry, boys - no quick cashing out for you!  Feinberg isn't limiting his power play to just these five firms”X‰   "Wall Street Titans Slash Compensation Amidst Political Pressure and Bonus Backlash!  In a stunning move, the top investment banks Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase have succumbed to intense political pressure and drastically cut their compensation in the fourth quarter. And if you thought that was shocking, just wait until the juicy details of their top executives' bonuses emerge in the upcoming weeks!  These Wall Street giants had initially set aside a whopping $39.9 billion for pay in 2009, which already pales in comparison to their record-breaking $44.7 billion in 2007. But hold onto your hats, folks, because this total fell short of analysts' expectations by a whopping $6.2 billion! That's almost enough to buy your own private island!  Experts believe that the banks' decision to cut compensation was directly influenced by the relentless pressure from Washington. Michael Robinson, a senior vice president of Levick Strategic Communications and former head of public affairs at the Securities and Exchange Commission, stated, 'There's no question that Wall Street got the message from Washington.' Looks like the politicians' portrayal of the big banks as the bad guys has worked like a charm, and they are not likely to let go of this narrative anytime soon!  But let's not forget that the banks are not completely innocent in this game. They have played a significant role in their own downfall by positioning themselves as the masters of big bonuses. And boy, have they paid the price for it! With politicians and the public breathing down their necks, the pressure on these banks is mounting, and it seems they are finally feeling the heat.  So, dear readers, sit back, relax, and get ready for the scandalous details of these executives' bonuses. It's bound to be a riveting tale of greed, power, and political maneuvering.

Winter hunting season is here, folks, and it's time to feast on those pesky resident Canada geese that just won't leave us alone! According to the infamous hunting guru, Jackson Landers, these non-native waterfowl are an absolute treasure trove of untapped food. You heard it right - these big geese, originally from the Midwest, were brought to the East Coast as live decoys by hunters in the early 1900s. But when using live decoys became illegal, these birds were set free and multiplied like crazy, wreaking havoc on our golf courses, lawns, and farms.  Thankfully, our brilliant government agencies have taken action to control this goose population explosion. They've adopted more lenient hunting guidelines, which means these geese are slowly disappearing from rural areas. Unfortunately, they're still thriving where hunting is restricted. So, if you're up for the challenge, you better get yourself a hunting license and attend those hunter safety classes before you start pursuing geese with your bare hands! Yes, you read that right - bare hands!  But hold your horses, city dwellers! Urban geese are relatively safe from hunters unless they decide to play chicken with airplanes. That's when the feds swoop in and turn this aviation hazard into a mouth-watering harvest. The Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services program is making sure these geese don't go to waste. They donate goose carcasses to food banks, animal rescue groups, and even zoos. Talk about a wild feast!  Last year alone, the USDA donated over a ton of goose flesh in the Maryland-Delaware-Washington area. One lucky recipient, the Maryland Food Bank, received a hefty 325 pounds of ground goose and goose chubs (stew meat). And boy, were they thrilled! According to Nancy Smith, spokesperson for the food bank, protein donations are a rare gem, and demand for goose meat is off the charts. It's a hot commodity, folks!  But of course, there are always naysayers like Sharon Pawlak, from the Coalition to Prevent the Destruction of Canada Geese. She claims that donating goose meat to food pantries is just a PR stunt to justify the "cruel and unnecessary slaughter" of these so-called nuisance geese. Pawlak also raises concerns about potentially toxic meat being fed to people who are already dealing with health issues. Fair point, as geese that”X¿	  "Matt Cain's Pitching Masterclass Sends Giants Soaring to Victory and Top of the League!"  In a stunning display of skill and dominance, Matt Cain led the San Francisco Giants to a resounding 4-2 victory over the struggling Colorado Rockies on Sunday. Not only did Cain pitch a stellar game, but he also propelled the Giants back into first place in the National League West, leaving fans in awe of his incredible performance.  San Francisco's triumph was made even sweeter by the fact that their rivals, the San Diego Padres, suffered a defeat at the hands of the Cincinnati Reds. This loss allowed the Giants to claim the top spot in the league, moving a half-game ahead of their nearest competitors. The Padres now find themselves desperately trying to catch up, falling 4 1/2 games behind the Giants and four games behind the Padres in the wild-card race. The Rockies, on the other hand, continue to struggle and have now lost six of their last seven games, further distancing themselves from the frontrunners.  Cain's exceptional pitching kept the Rockies hitless until the eighth inning, when Jay Payton managed to sneak in an infield single with one out. Despite this minor setback, Cain remained unfazed and determined to secure the win. The Rockies' pinch-hitter, Melvin Mora, did manage to break Cain's scoreless streak with a two-run homer, ending his impressive 20-inning run. However, it was not enough to derail Cain's dominance. The right-hander went on to pitch a complete game, allowing only three hits and securing his 12th career complete game and fourth this season. Cain's phenomenal performance has now earned him his fourth consecutive win and has kept him undefeated in seven outings since August 18th.  The Giants' victory was also fueled by the explosive hitting of Freddy Sanchez, who launched a powerful home run off Jorge De La Rosa. Cody Ross also contributed with a home run of his own, further solidifying the Giants' lead over the Rockies.  In another thrilling game, the Cincinnati Reds showcased their strength and determination with a resounding 12-2 victory over the San Diego Padres. Chris Heisey led the charge for the Reds, hitting a home run and a three-run double, further reducing their magic number to clinch the NL Central. Joey Votto and Brandon Phillips also joined in on the home run party, ensuring that the Reds are inching ever closer to securing the division title. This defeat for the Padres meant that the Philadelphia Phillies secured their”X­   SHOCKING NEWS: ALDI CO-FOUNDER THEO ALBRECHT'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH AT 88!  In a tragic turn of events, Theo Albrecht, the mastermind behind German discount supermarket chain Aldi, has passed away at the ripe age of 88. The enigmatic billionaire breathed his last breath in his hometown of Essen, Germany, leaving the world in shock and mourning. Aldi Nord, the division of the famous supermarket, made the devastating announcement on Wednesday, but curiously withheld the cause of death, leaving everyone wondering what really happened to this titan of retail.  Theo Albrecht, along with his older brother Karl, delved into the retail business as the dust settled after World War II. Their ingenious vision gave birth to the first Aldi stores in the groovy 1960s, forever changing the way Germans shopped.

But their empire didn't stop there; Aldi's reach extended far beyond the borders of Germany, with stores captivating shoppers across Europe and even beyond!  While they amassed unimaginable wealth, the Albrecht brothers shrouded themselves in secrecy, avoiding the limelight at all costs like true masters of intrigue. Despite their evasive nature, their fortunes spoke volumes, consistently catapulting them to the top of every list as Germany's wealthiest individuals. The Albrecht brothers were a force to be reckoned with, their business acumen leaving a lasting legacy that will forever be etched in the annals of retail history.  As the world bids farewell to the enigmatic Theo Albrecht, we can only hope that the mysteries surrounding his death will eventually be revealed. But for now, let us remember this retail titan for his remarkable achievements, his revolutionary supermarkets, and the empire he built from humble beginnings.

In a shocking turn of events, Senate Republicans have once again blocked a bill that could have helped struggling small businesses. The $30 billion fund designed to boost lending to these businesses was swiftly shut down by the GOP, who argued that it was just another bailout.  But here's the real question: Will the American people blame the Republicans for this obstruction? Despite the Democrats running Congress, it seems that the public might see this as just another example of Beltway noise. The bill's chances of passing before the August recess are now slim to none.  The Associated Press summed up the significance of this standoff by highlighting the Democrats' failed attempts to create jobs. With the midterm elections approaching, this could be a major blow to the ruling party's chances of keeping their majorities in the House and Senate.  Both sides are pointing fingers, with Republicans claiming that Democrats blocked their desired amendments and Democrats countering that they agreed to votes on GOP amendments, only to be met with further demands. It's all just a bunch of bickering and white noise, overshadowing the larger story at hand.  So what will the American people take away from this? Republicans seem to believe that by obstructing Democratic legislation and fueling the Democrats' complaints about their role, they can paint a picture of a broken government that has failed to deliver. And if the AP's portrayal of the story is any indication, Democrats are in serious trouble.  In the end, it's unclear who will bear the blame for the consequences of this obstructionism. But one thing is certain: the battle for power continues to rage on Capitol Hill, leaving the American people wondering if anything will ever get done.

  SHOCKING SHOWDOWN: Bernanke's Second Term Hangs in the Balance as Senate Prepares to Vote!  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the man at the center of the storm over Wall Street bailouts, is on the brink of securing a second term as head of the U.S. central bank. But it won't be an easy victory! The Senate is gearing up for a crucial vote on Thursday that will determine whether Bernanke has enough support to beat a filibuster and secure his reappointment. This nail-biting battle has the potential to be the closest vote ever for a Federal Reserve nominee, with opposition reaching unprecedented levels.  The stakes are high, and the stock market is watching with bated breath. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial average took a nosedive when news of mounting opposition to Bernanke broke. But just as the situation seemed dire, his prospects brightened, and the market made a miraculous recovery. Clearly, Wall Street has been rooting for Bernanke to stay in power.  Why is this vote so crucial? Well, the Federal Reserve holds immense power over the economy, jobs, and inflation. It has the ability to set interest rates, which can make or break economic activity. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in maintaining economic stability by offering emergency loans to banks when they're in dire need of cash. That's why it's crucial for Bernanke to secure his second term.  Senate leaders from both parties are expressing confidence that Bernanke will come out on top. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell boldly declared, "I believe that the chairman is going to be confirmed by a bipartisan vote." However, this battle is far from over. Even if Bernanke manages to overcome procedural obstacles with the support of at least 60 senators, his final confirmation vote is expected to be a nail-biter.  Bernanke's detractors are numerous and vocal. He has faced widespread public and lawmaker anger over his support of Wall Street bailouts, particularly the controversial $182 billion rescue of insurance giant American International Group Inc. Unemployment rates have skyrocketed, and the public is fuming over bankers' hefty bonuses. Critics argue that Bernanke failed to detect the impending crisis and neglected to rein in the reckless behavior of the banking industry. Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont minced no words when he accused Bernanke of being "asleep at the switch while Wall Street became a gambling casino."  But the biggest challenge for the Federal Reserve this year lies ahead - deciding when and how to raise interest rates to foster economic recovery.

This lucky lad was found buried with a cluster of amber beads around his neck. But here's the jaw-dropping twist: the analysis of his skeletal remains revealed that he hailed from hundreds of miles away in the Mediterranean! Talk about an exotic vacation!  Jane Evans of the British Geological Survey exclaimed, "This find proves that Stonehenge was the place to be for ancient travelers from across Europe!" Noted Stonehenge scholar, Timothy Darvill from Bournemouth University, also chimed in, stating, "This discovery adds more weight to the idea that people went to great lengths to visit Stonehenge because it was clearly a happening cult center. And let me tell you, long-distance travel was all the rage back then!"  The teenage skeleton, believed to be around 14 or 15 years old, was unearthed just two miles away from Stonehenge. The necklace he was sporting was a type not recognized in Britain, providing the first clue about his foreign origins. But it was the groundbreaking technique of isotope analysis that really blew this case wide open. By analyzing the strontium and oxygen isotopes in his tooth enamel, scientists were able to determine that this adventurous teen grew up in the Mediterranean region. Talk about CSI: Prehistoric Edition!  Notably, this wealthy youngster is not alone in his far-flung travels to Stonehenge. Another famous visitor, known as the 'Amesbury Archer' due to the stone arrowheads found with his remains, was buried a mere three miles away from the monument. But get this â€“ he's believed to have come all the way from the Alpine foothills of central Europe! And that's not all, folks! The 'Boscombe Bowmen', a group discovered nearby, are thought to have hailed from Wales or maybe even Brittany. Stonehenge was clearly the hottest travel destination of its time!  The big question remains: why were these globetrotting teens drawn to Stonehenge? Theories abound, ranging from it being a sun-worshipping”XK  "Pregnant Woman Beats Death Penalty - Appeals Conviction for Heroin Trafficking!"  In a shocking turn of events, Samantha Orobator, a twenty-year-old British woman imprisoned for life in Laos for trafficking heroin, has decided to fight back! Orobator's legal team, led by the fierce Rhona Friedman, has filed an appeal with Britain's Appeal Court, claiming that Orobator did not receive a fair trial in Laos.  This scandalous case takes an even more twisted turn when we learn that Orobator was actually allowed to return to Britain earlier this month to serve out her jail term. Can you believe it? She managed to escape the clutches of the death penalty because Laos cannot execute pregnant women! Talk about a lucky break!  The Laotian police claimed to have discovered a whopping 1.5 pounds (680 grams) of heroin on Orobator's body when she was apprehended back in August 2008. That's a whole lot of drugs! But Orobator and her tenacious legal team are not backing down. They are determined to prove that this evidence was planted, and that she was set up from the very beginning.  Will Orobator manage to overturn her conviction and secure her freedom? Stay tuned as we follow this jaw-dropping case that has shocked the world. It's a battle of the century, folks, and Samantha Orobator is fighting for her life â€“ and the life of her unborn child.”X)  SHOCKING HOUSE PRICE RISE IN BRITAIN!  Hold onto your hats, folks, because house prices in Britain have skyrocketed by a whopping 1.6 percent in August! It seems like low interest rates have come to the rescue and saved the housing market from doom. The Nationwide Building Society, the nation's No. 3 mortgage lender, spilled the beans on this incredible news yesterday.  But don't get too excited just yet. Even with this epic rise, the average house price is still a staggering 2.7 percent lower than it was a year ago. It's not all doom and gloom though â€“ this is a major improvement from July when prices only went up by a measly 1.4 percent. Can you believe that just last month, house prices were plunging by a shocking 6.2 percent? It's like a rollercoaster ride!  Nationwide wants to burst your bubble, though â€“ they're warning that these low interest rates won't last forever. As the economy starts to grow and inflation rears its ugly head, interest rates will have to rise. Brace yourselves, because when that happens, more houses will flood the market and the recent surge in buyer interest will fizzle out. The building society says, "Hey, we can't sustain these insane price increases if interest rates go up!" But don't panic just yet â€“ a rise in interest rates is still a way off.  So, there you have it, folks. House prices in Britain have defied all odds and actually gone up. Who would have thought? But remember, this crazy ride might come to an end sooner than you think.

  SHOCKING REVELATION: HALF OF RECALLED DRUGS LINKED TO HEART COMPLICATIONS!  In a stunning discovery, it has been revealed that a whopping 50% of the drugs pulled from the market for safety reasons since 1995 had dangerous heart complications! This alarming finding has sparked outrage from Congress and doctors, who are demanding a closer government review of side effects. The truth has finally been exposed, and it's sending shockwaves through the medical community!  According to top-secret information obtained by Bloomberg, a review of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data unveiled that these treacherous products were on the market for anywhere between 11 months to a mind-boggling 30 years! Can you believe it? For decades, innocent Americans were unknowingly putting their lives at risk!  One scandalous case involves GlaxoSmithKline's diabetes drug Avandia, which was shamelessly marketed for a shocking 11 years! Can you imagine the countless lives that were endangered during that time? Luckily, the FDA finally took action and restricted its use after a link to heart ailments was discovered. But it begs the question, how many other drugs are lurking out there, waiting to wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims?  Now, the FDA is conducting a thorough investigation into the heart risks associated with Abbott Laboratories' diet pill Meridia, which has been shamelessly sold since 1997. Are they kidding? It has taken them over two decades to even consider the potential dangers? This is an outrage!  Thankfully, Senator Charles Grassley, a true hero, is fighting for justice. He believes that the FDA needs a dedicated center that independently studies drug safety. At present, early warnings within the agency are being ignored, and innocent lives are being sacrificed for profit. It's sickening!  Doctors, too, are demanding change. They argue that heart risks should be identified through large controlled studies before or after a drug hits the market. They believe that the FDA's current system, which relies heavily on voluntary reports from doctors and patients, is simply not enough. Lives are at stake, and we cannot afford to gamble with people's health!  Senator Grassley, along with Representative Rosa DeLauro, is working tirelessly to pass a bill that creates this much-needed FDA center. It's time for action! We must protect innocent Americans from the clutches of these dangerous drugs.  Janet Woodcock, the head of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, claims that the agency has already implemented new safety tests to assess”Xg   SHOCKING TWIST: Angela Merkel's Finance Minister to Leave Government?  In a scandalous turn of events, rumors are swirling that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, may be on the verge of leaving the government. The media has been abuzz with speculation about Schaeuble's future, especially after his own spokesman resigned following a public dressing-down by the minister himself. But that's not all â€“ brace yourselves for more shocking revelations!  It turns out that Schaeuble has been plagued by health problems, which have further fueled the rumors. He has recently spent weeks in the hospital â€“ not once, but twice this year â€“ for treatment related to his disability. What kind of disability, you may wonder? Well, we don't have all the juicy details just yet, but it's clear that it's something serious enough to warrant extended hospital stays.  Now, hold on to your seats, folks, because there's more. The daily Handelsblatt, known for its inside scoops, reported on Friday that a major reshuffle is in the works, and guess who's expected to be shown the door? You guessed it â€“ Schaeuble! Although the report doesn't cite any specific sources, it's certainly enough to set tongues wagging.  But wait, there's a twist! Merkel herself has stepped forward to squash the rumors. In an interview with ARD television, she dismissed the "fabrications" and asserted that she has a great working relationship with Schaeuble. She even went as far as to say that they worked well together at the recent Group of 20 summit and have every intention of continuing this fruitful partnership.  The plot thickens, dear readers. Will Schaeuble really be forced to bid adieu to the government? Or is Merkel simply trying to save face and keep the scandal under wraps? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for more jaw-dropping updates on this gripping political tale!”Xt  ROYAL AHOLD NV TAKES A HIT FROM TAXES, BUT STILL SHOWS GROWTH IN SALES!  In a shocking turn of events, Royal Ahold NV, the Dutch owner of the popular Stop & Shop and Giant supermarkets in the United States, experienced a 4.4% drop in third-quarter earnings due to pesky higher taxes. But don't fret, because despite this setback, the company managed to still see a growth in sales and operating profits!  The company reported a net profit of (EURO)233 million ($315 million), which unfortunately was down from their previous (EURO)244 million. So what caused this downfall? Well, it turns out that Ahold was no longer able to bask in the glory of tax benefits from previous losses. Consequently, they had to cough up (EURO)49 million in taxes this quarter, compared to a mere (EURO)1 million during the same period last year. Ouch!  But hey, it's not all doom and gloom for Ahold! They did manage to achieve a 7.5% increase in operating profit, reaching an impressive (EURO)285 million. And let's not forget about their sales, which rose a whopping 11% to (EURO)6.69 billion. How did they pull this off, you ask? Well, they made some killer acquisitions and benefitted from a strong dollar. Talk about making the best out of a sticky situation!  Chief Executive John Rishton didn't sugarcoat the business conditions, admitting that times are tough. However, he proudly stated that Ahold "delivered another quarter of solid results" and even managed to snatch some market share. Take that, competitors!  In a surprising twist, Ahold's U.S. stores saw a 1% increase in sales compared to the same period last year. Sure, it's not groundbreaking, but it's definitely better than their main rival, Wal-Mart, whose same-store sales have plummeted due to intense price wars. Looks like Ahold is slowly but surely gaining the upper hand!  Unfortunately, Ahold's U.S. margins suffered a dip, falling from 4.6% to 3.7% of sales. But let's not dwell on the negatives because in the Netherlands, where Ahold operates the dominant Albert Heijn chain, things are looking up! Same-store sales rose by a fantastic 4.5%, and margins improved ever so slightly from 6.9% to 7%. Ahold”X¶  SHOCKING REVELATION: Millionaire Bankers Exposed!  In a bombshell report commissioned by the government, it has been revealed that British banks have been hiding the shocking truth about their millionaire employees. These high-earning non-executives have been raking in a mind-boggling Â£1 million ($1.65 million) a year, and now it's time for them to face the music!  The report, conducted by David Walker, former chairman of Morgan Stanley International, also proposed measures to rein in the risky activities of these banks. One of the recommendations is to give non-executives more power to assess risk and payment. It's about time these big shots are held accountable for their actions!  But that's not all. Walker also called for active investors to step up and take responsibility as owners of businesses. He urged them to engage earlier if they suspect any weaknesses in governance. It's time for these investors to stop sitting back and start taking action!  During the financial crisis, everyone was focused on the pay received by executive board members. But what about the cash being handed out to these high-earning non-executives? Walker revealed that bank owners knew very little about this, and it's time for them to start asking questions. Why are so many people making so much money?  In fact, Walker estimates that there are well over a thousand individuals earning more than Â£1 million a year in London's banks and financial institutions. Can you believe that? It's an absolute outrage!  To add insult to injury, the report also suggests that two-thirds of cash bonuses should be deferred, and at least half of variable pay or bonuses should be paid through a long-term incentive scheme. It's clear that these bankers need some serious oversight when it comes to their extravagant compensation.  This groundbreaking report was commissioned by none other than British Prime Minister Gordon Brown back in February. It's about time someone took a stand and exposed the truth about these millionaire bankers!

In a world full of finger-pointing and blame-shifting, Sarah Ferguson has proven to be a rare gem. Despite being caught on tape in a humiliating situation, she didn't lash out at the press like most celebrities would. The Duchess of York could have easily berated the lying media after a News of the World reporter posed as a wealthy businessman offering her $40,000 in exchange for access to her ex-husband, Prince Andrew. But instead, she swallowed her pride and apologized for her clumsy attempt at influence-peddling.  However, not all public figures are as upfront and honest as Ferguson. Take GOP Senate nominee, Rand Paul, for example. He spent a whopping 20 minutes on MSNBC with Rachel Maddow, discussing his objections to a section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that impacts private businesses. Maddow, a self-proclaimed liberal, gave him ample opportunity to explain his position, even when she posed questions about desegregating lunch counters. Rather than simply acknowledging the settled law of the land for the past 50 years, Paul rambled on about the rights of restaurant owners and even brought up guns.   Following the interview, Paul quickly backtracked and accused Maddow of trying to paint him as a supporter of abhorrent practices. He claimed that she twisted his words and went on a rant about it. He even had the audacity to cancel an interview on 'Meet the Press' in frustration with the mainstream media.   Sarah Palin, always ready to jump on any opportunity to criticize the media, joined in on the bashing. She accused Maddow of having an agenda and being prejudice, conveniently forgetting that her own network is filled with ideologically driven individuals. The truth is, Maddow's interview with Paul was anything but a 'gotcha' moment. In fact, Paul had already made similar points to the Louisville Courier-Journal a month prior, which the national press conveniently missed.   Meanwhile, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal took a different approach when faced with a scandal. After the New York Times revealed that he had lied about serving in Vietnam, Blumenthal refrained from launching a direct attack on the newspaper. Quite a contrast from the usual blame game we see from public figures, isn't it?  While Ferguson takes responsibility for her actions, others continue to deflect and shift the blame onto the media. It's about time we see more public”X
  Arizona Governor Signs Controversial Immigration Bill, Sparking National Debate  In a move that has sent shockwaves through the nation, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer has signed into law the toughest immigration bill the country has ever seen. This bold action has set the stage for an epic showdown with President Obama and has reignited a fiery national debate just months before the congressional midterm elections.  Brewer, a Republican facing a tough primary challenge, expressed her frustration with Washington's inaction on the issue, stating that the lack of federal action has left border protection solely in the hands of the states. "We in Arizona have been more than patient waiting for Washington to act," she declared passionately. Her remarks were broadcasted live on CNN, with hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside her office in Phoenix.  But even before the ink had dried on the bill, President Obama wasted no time in criticizing the new law. Obama called it "misguided" and immediately directed the Justice Department to keep a close eye on its implementation, warning that it could potentially violate citizens' civil rights. He used the Arizona law as ammunition to urge Congress to swiftly tackle immigration reform, a topic that has recently hit a roadblock in bipartisan talks. Obama warned that failure to act at the federal level would only encourage others to act irresponsibly.  With one stroke of her pen, Brewer has unleashed a firestorm of passion from activists and politicians on both sides of the immigration debate. Hispanics across the country, a crucial political group, are threatening to rally behind Democrats come November. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong advocate for immigration reform, described the law as "harsh."  The response from national Republicans has been somewhat restrained, reflecting a division within the party on whether to pursue stricter immigration laws or to court the growing pool of immigrant voters. The new law, which will go into effect in 90 days, makes it a state crime to be in the country illegally, and legal immigrants must carry their paperwork at all times to prove their legal status. Arizona police will now be required to question anyone they "reasonably suspect" of being undocumented, a provision that critics argue will lead to racial profiling but that supporters maintain will provide flexibility in enforcing existing immigration laws.  Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden, voiced his opposition to the bill just hours before it became law. He urged the country to "choose a different future" than the one Arizona was advancing. Although he vowed that the Justice Department would closely monitor the situation, Obama stopped short of demanding immediate intervention.  Legal challenges from outside groups are expected to swiftly”XG   SHOCKING TERROR PLOT UNCOVERED IN LONDON!  In a jaw-dropping twist, a British man has been found GUILTY of plotting a heinous attack on innocent people he deemed "non-British." The shocking verdict was delivered by a London jury at the Central Criminal Court, leaving the entire nation in disbelief.  Neil Lewington, a 43-year-old man with a sinister agenda, was convicted on Wednesday of terrifying terrorist offenses. The courtroom was buzzing with anticipation as prosecutor Brian Altman unveiled the spine-chilling truth about Lewington's extreme views on race and ethnicity.  Lewington was hell-bent on unleashing chaos upon those he deemed "non-British." But his dastardly plans were foiled when fate intervened during a heated argument with a train conductor. The authorities were alerted, and they swiftly apprehended the villainous Lewington in October.  What the police discovered next would send shivers down anyone's spine! Concealed within Lewington's bag were not one, but TWO firebombs. Can you imagine the devastation that would have unfolded had they been unleashed upon unsuspecting victims?  But that wasn't all! When the investigators delved into Lewington's lair, they stumbled upon a shocking revelation. A notebook, chillingly labeled "Waffen SS U.K. members handbook," was discovered, along with a cache of bomb-making equipment, including electrical timers. It was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode!  Now, the nation eagerly awaits the day when justice will be served. Lewington, the despicable mastermind behind this twisted plot, will face the consequences of his sinister actions. The court will decide his fate in due course, and one can only hope that the punishment will be severe enough to reflect the gravity of his vile intentions.  Stay tuned to the National Enquirer for all the latest updates on this spine-tingling case!”X¡
  Washington in Chaos: McConnell Surrenders to Tea Party Demands!  It's a political earthquake in the nation's capital as Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell, caves to pressure from the tea party movement. In an unprecedented move, McConnell has endorsed a ban on earmarks, a practice he has long defended. But it seems the conservative rebellion led by Sen. Jim DeMint was too powerful to ignore, with enough senators ready to defeat McConnell if he didn't give in.  In a shocking twist, McConnell announced his reversal on the Senate floor moments after the midterm election break. While the ban on earmarks is nonbinding, McConnell's decision to end the use of federal funding for pet projects shows just how much pressure incumbents are under to appease angry voters. The American people spoke on November 2nd, and politicians are scrambling to save their political careers.  "I know the good that has come from the projects I have supported in my state. I don't apologize for them," McConnell defiantly declared. And who can blame him? According to government watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, McConnell's earmark tally over the years approaches a staggering $1 billion. But even he couldn't ignore the abuse and wasteful spending associated with earmarks anymore. It's clear that Republicans in Washington are determined to fight this out-of-control practice.  But the drama doesn't end there! Senate Democrats are also feeling the heat and making their own concessions. The party has elevated their most combative spokesman, Sen. Charles Schumer, to a new leadership role. He will be in charge of a messaging and rapid-response team that will push back against Republicans. It's a sign that Democrats are ready to fight fire with fire.  In addition, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has responded to calls for more representation from junior lawmakers by adding Sen. Mark Begich to his leadership team. Democrats are trying to show unity and adapt to the new political reality of a divided Congress and a more conservative Republican opposition.  The battle for power continues this week as both Senate Democrats and Republicans vote on party leaders for the next Congress. Meanwhile, House Democrats and Republicans will hold their leadership elections shortly after. With the Democrats still controlling the House and Senate for the rest of the year, party leaders are starting to adjust to the idea of compromise and working with their Republican counterparts.  The pressure is on for Democrats to make room for Republican views on critical issues such as taxes and spending. These matters will dominate the lame-duck session, and President Barack Obama has already signaled his willingness to compromise”X	
  "LIVERPOOL IN COURT BATTLE: AMERICAN OWNERS' SLIM CHANCE TO BLOCK RED SOX TAKEOVER"  In a dramatic court showdown, Liverpool's board of directors emerged victorious in their ongoing effort to sell the club to the owners of the Boston Red Sox. The American owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr., were dealt a crushing blow as a British High Court judge issued an injunction against them, ordering them to withdraw their legal action in a Dallas district court. This ruling effectively nullified the temporary restraining order Hicks and Gillett had managed to obtain just a day earlier to halt the $476 million sale of the club to New England Sports Ventures, led by financier John Henry.  Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton expressed his optimism, stating, "We are nearly there, folks! We are still battling it out in Texas, but we're on the right track. We just need to take away that pesky restraining order... Mr. Henry is still very committed to this deal."  Hicks and Gillett, who could lose over $200 million if the sale goes through, have labeled the attempted sale as an "epic swindle" that undervalues one of English football's most successful clubs. However, Judge Christopher Floyd has ordered them to withdraw their legal action by Friday afternoon or face contempt of court charges.  To further complicate matters, Texas District Judge Jim Jordan delayed the hearing on NESV's motion to lift the restraining order until Friday morning. NESV lawyers argued that Liverpool would be headed for default if a ruling was not made soon. However, they failed to provide sufficient documentation when questioned by Jordan.  In response, Hicks' lawyer, Geoffrey Harper, requested two days to review NESV's motion. Harper claimed that if the relief was granted, the injunction would be rendered irrelevant, and the sale would be finalized. Jordan, however, resisted NESV's attorneys' pressure to make an immediate ruling and scheduled a hearing for early Friday to expedite the sale process.  NESV lawyer David Chivers confidently stated that once the Texas order was withdrawn, the sale would proceed as planned, asserting, "We are the owners of Liverpool. The owners from beyond the grave are seeking to exercise with their dead hand a continuing grip on this company."  Judge Floyd did not mince words when criticizing Hicks and Gillett for resorting to an American court after losing their previous case in the British High Court, labeling their conduct as "unconscionable." He further accused them of initially concealing the High Court action from the Texas”X¦	  Shocking Aftermath of Tsunami and Earthquake: Haiti and Aceh Still Struggling!  It's been five years since a devastating tsunami wreaked havoc in Aceh, Indonesia, leaving a trail of destruction and claiming the lives of an estimated 200,000 people. But guess what? The recovery process is still far from over! And if you thought that was bad, brace yourself for the horrors of Haiti, where a recent earthquake has caused similar levels of damage and death. But hold on tight, because the challenges Haiti faces in rebuilding are even greater than those in Aceh.  The United States and other major international donors better buckle up for the long haul, because it's going to take years to help these countries get back on their feet. But let's not get carried away with false hopes that outside aid alone will save the day for Haiti. We've seen it all before - international donor conferences pledging mountains of assistance, only for a tiny trickle to reach those in need. This time, we need real follow-through!  Haiti is going to need billions of dollars to clear its rubble, rebuild its infrastructure, and provide shelter for the hundreds of thousands of homeless people. And let's not forget about the economy - it's in dire need of a kickstart. The government needs to put the idle youth population to work, clearing roads and rubble. The United Nations and the World Bank are already stepping in with some cash and food-for-work programs, but more needs to be done.  But here's the real kicker - the international donors can't do it alone. They need a functioning Haitian government to partner with. For years, Haiti has been a mess, with aid agencies pouring in with good intentions but making little impact on the country's deep poverty. We can't expect the developed world to magically fix everything, but there are ways to improve.  First, we need constancy. Donors can't just pack up and leave when the cameras stop rolling. Second, we need to empower Haitians to take a more active role in reconstruction and aid projects. And let's not forget about the countryside - it's been neglected for too long, leading to the unsustainable growth of Port-au-Prince. And last but not least, we need to establish accountability systems for aid disbursement and nurture Haitian civil society to combat the corruption that plagues the country.  It may be a long and arduous journey, but we can't give up on Haiti and Aceh. The road to recovery may be treacherous, but”XÉ	  OBAMA ON THE ATTACK: BANKS TO PAY UP!  President Barack Obama is planning to stick it to the big banks, announcing a new fee that will help the government recoup taxpayer bailout money and tackle the federal budget deficit. This bombshell revelation is set to send shockwaves through Wall Street and ignite public anger over the financial industry's recklessness.  The President is expected to unveil his proposal to raise a staggering $120 billion in a press conference at the White House. But don't worry, folks, Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, assures us that this fee won't be passed on to us hardworking consumers. Yeah, right!  This fee, which will be spread over a decade, will be based on the leverage of each firm, or how much liability they have. It's a sneaky move by Obama's team, who wants to make sure those greedy banks pay up for their role in the economic crisis. The final amount will be based on the total losses from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which is expected to be even higher than the Treasury's estimate of $120 billion. Talk about making the banks squirm!  The White House is keeping quiet about which banks will be hit the hardest. But trust us, folks, this move is all about politics. Obama wants to tap into the public's anger towards the bailouts, executive bonuses, and the deficit. And boy, the public is furious! They would do anything to see those bankers squirm, even if it means shooting and burning them. Yikes!  With the unemployment rate skyrocketing and the deficit reaching record-breaking levels, Obama knows he needs to do something to appease the voters before the upcoming congressional elections. And let's not forget about those outrageous Wall Street bonuses. While the economy is struggling to recover from the worst recession in decades, those bankers are raking in the cash. It's enough to make your blood boil!  Democratic Party leaders are all on board with Obama's plan. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank is all in favor, although he hasn't seen the specifics yet. On the other side, Republicans are feeling the pressure. While they also agree that the banks' bonuses are irresponsible, they fear that taxing the banks could hurt lending and job creation. Tough luck, guys. It's a political season, and opposing this bill won't be easy.  The administration is still working out the final details of this game-changing fee, which will be presented in the fiscal 2011 budget next month. Obama has been eyeing”XA	  EXCLUSIVE: Ray LaHood - From Unknown to Rock Star Cabinet Member!  In the glittering world of Washington, where lies and deceit run rampant, one man stands out as a beacon of truth. Meet Ray LaHood, the most down-to-earth Secretary of Transportation in history. With his no-nonsense attitude and unwavering commitment to his job, LaHood has become an unlikely hero in the nation's capital.  At 64 years old, LaHood may not have the same ambition as his younger counterparts, but what he lacks in youth, he makes up for in passion. He's not afraid to speak his mind and follow through on his promises, which is a rare quality in a city full of politicians who are more concerned with their own agendas.  LaHood's conservative yet pragmatic politics may not be in vogue these days, but that hasn't stopped him from making a name for himself. He has transformed the seemingly unglamorous Cabinet position of Secretary of Transportation into a platform for spreading his message of safety. From hobnobbing with celebrities like Jordin Sparks and Oprah Winfrey to globe-trotting to countries like China and Japan, LaHood has gone above and beyond to promote his cause.  And his efforts haven't gone unnoticed. With over 3,300 Facebook fans, 6,000 Twitter followers, and a blog that receives over 40,000 hits a week, LaHood is a social media sensation. He's even surpassed President Barack Obama himself in the world of federal blogdom. Clearly, people are listening to what he has to say.  But LaHood's rise to stardom didn't come easily. While other Cabinet members were handed glamorous roles, LaHood had to work hard to make a name for himself. He wasn't afraid to take on big projects like championing high-speed rail and advocating for "livable communities" with low carbon footprints. And who could forget the famous "cash for clunkers" program? These accomplishments have solidified his position as a force to be reckoned with.  However, LaHood's true passion lies in fighting against distracted driving. He's made it his mission to raise awareness about the dangers of texting and driving, even forming a MADD-like group called Focus Driven. His efforts have garnered the support of icons like Oprah and led to nationwide initiatives to combat distracted driving. LaHood's dedication to saving lives is truly commendable.  In a city full of phonies and backstabbers,”Xõ	  SHOCKING: Obama's Call to Sherrod Sparks Chardonnay Summit! Guilt-Free Vacations for All!  President Obama's recent phone call to Shirley Sherrod has sent shockwaves through Washington. Rumor has it that a "Chardonnay summit" is now in the works at the Rose Garden. But what's the real reason behind all this sudden remorse? It's simple - they just want to wrap up this incident quickly so they can all enjoy their vacations without a hint of guilt. They want to maintain the illusion of our "post-racial society."  But let's not be fooled. This incident is just a microcosm of our nation's failed attempts to address race. Sherrod's story was a powerful tale of transformation and reconciliation between blacks and whites. It had the potential to bring about progress and healing. She spoke of unity, of working together to save farms and end poverty and suffering. But unfortunately, our attention spans are too short to delve into the complexities of racial bias and struggle.  Instead of engaging in a meaningful dialogue on race, we prefer to hurl accusations from opposite corners at the mere mention of the topic. Attorney General Eric Holder was right when he called us a "nation of cowards" in this regard. We cannot continue to ignore this challenge.  The truth is, racial attitudes in today's society are often complicated, multi-layered, and conflicted. It's not just about individuals; it's about structural racism and implicit bias. We see evidence of this inequality everywhere - from the disproportionate number of young black men and women in prison to the segregation of our neighborhoods and schools. The lack of opportunities for children of color in poor communities, the inferior medical treatment they receive, and the underrepresentation of people of color in positions of power are all symptoms of a deeply rooted problem.  But let's be clear, this doesn't mean that doctors, nurses, police officers, judges, and others are all prejudiced. Most of them are well-intentioned professionals who genuinely believe they are free of racial bias. It's not easy for them to connect their actions to the broader structural conditions that have been built up over decades and centuries.  Implicit bias is a reality we must confront head-on. Numerous studies have shown that unconscious racial stereotypes affect our decision-making, whether we realize it or not. It's not about being prejudiced; it's about being human.  So let's not sweep this under the rug. We need a real dialogue on race that goes beyond a single news cycle. It's”XH	  "Explosions, Gunfire, and Chaos! Tear Gas Fills the Air as Protesters Clash in Kosovo Town!"  In a shocking turn of events, the European Union police in northern Kosovo were forced to take drastic measures as they fired tear gas to disperse a furious mob of 100 Serbs. Their anger erupted over the reconstruction of Albanian houses in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica. Chaos ensued as protesters on both sides hurled stones at each other, leaving seven people injured in the crossfire.  The violence escalated when an explosion rocked the area, followed by the terrifying sound of gunfire. Panic and fear gripped the town as the clash between Serbs and ethnic Albanians reached new heights. This alarming incident is just the latest in a series of similar confrontations that have plagued the town.  The Serbs have made it abundantly clear that they will only allow the return of ethnic Albanians to their areas if Serbs are able to return to the Albanian-run south. This tense condition has created a deadlock, with Kosovo's government unable to assert control over the country's north. The beleaguered Serb minority staunchly opposes Kosovo's independence, which has been recognized by an impressive 62 countries.  But wait, there's more! As tensions continue to rise, ethnic Albanians have also turned their frustration towards the European Union. A controversial agreement between EU mission officials in Kosovo and Serbia, aimed at exchanging information, has sparked outrage among ethnic Albanians. In an act of defiance, activists from a group called Self-determination took matters into their own hands.  In an audacious display of dissent, these activists overturned a staggering 24 vehicles belonging to the EU mission, known as EULEX, right in the heart of the capital city, Pristina. They punctured tires, smashed windows, and wreaked havoc on the streets. The authorities swiftly responded and arrested twenty activists involved in the mayhem.  EULEX was quick to condemn the attack, emphasizing that such criminal behavior does not serve the interests or arguments of any protesters. The tension between ethnic Albanians and the EU seems to be reaching a boiling point, with no resolution in sight.  As the chaos ensues and violence escalates, the future of Kosovo remains uncertain. Will peace ever prevail in this war-torn region? Only time will tell."”Xb	  "British Humor Unleashed: A Riotous Celebration of Political Satire and Silliness at Tate Britain Gallery!  Hold onto your hats, folks, because the British are about to show the world how they really feel about their politicians - by laughing at them! Get ready for a wild ride through 300 years of unruly artistic expression, starting with the legendary political satire of William Hogarth and the outrageous puppets of 'Spitting Image,' all the way to the hilarity of Benny Hill. Brace yourselves for 'Rude Britannia,' the most audacious exhibition to hit London's Tate Britain gallery!  Opening this Wednesday, 'Rude Britannia' is not for the faint of heart. This feast of irreverence and bad taste will make you question if there's something in the water that gives the British their unique sense of humor. It's a laugh riot that delves deep into the cultural and political history of this extraordinary nation. But don't expect just 'funny ha ha' - this exhibition is all about the power of comedy to say things that can't be said any other way.  Penelope Curtis, the bold director of Tate Britain, explains, 'We're not just here to make you giggle. We want to show you how humor can be a weapon, a tool to expose the truth that lies beneath the surface. These comic artists are like undercover agents, sneaking in serious messages while we're doubled over with laughter.'  Curator Martin Myrone believes that the British have a distinct character that oozes informality, humor, and sarcasm. And boy, has that character left its mark on the art world! Myrone admits that arguing for a national character in art can be tricky, but he insists that humor has played a pivotal role in shaping the story of British art.  While the rest of Europe was busy striving for high-minded classicism, the British were having a field day satirizing their politicians. Artists like Thomas Rowlandson, James Gillray, and Hogarth used their talents to mock and caricature the powerful figures of their time. The exhibition kicks off in the 17th century, when printing technology first allowed the mass production of political cartoons and broadsides. And let me tell you, those artists didn't hold back!  It seems that throughout history, politics, the economy, and social issues have always been fair game for cartoonists. Nothing has changed! Take, for example, an 18th-century etching titled 'Idol-Worship or the”•Ö     XL	  SHOCKING VICTORIES FOR NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA IN EUROPEAN TOURS!  It was a nail-biting start to the European tours for New Zealand and Australia as they battled it out against Wales and England on Saturday. The games were filled with drama, unexpected twists, and heart-stopping moments that left fans on the edge of their seats.  In a thrilling match against Wales, New Zealand had to fight tooth and nail to secure their victory. The first half ended in a tense 6-6 draw, but the All Blacks managed to turn things around in the second half. A try by Andrew Hore and two powerful penalties by Dan Carter sealed the deal, giving New Zealand a hard-earned 19-9 win. It was a close call, as Wales almost snatched victory from their grasp. Lock Alun-Wyn Jones intercepted a loose pass by New Zealand's Jimmy Cowan and took off towards the try line, but his lack of speed proved to be his downfall. The All Blacks breathed a sigh of relief, knowing they narrowly escaped defeat.  Carter, the hero of the match, expressed his gratitude for the win, acknowledging the tough fight put up by the Welsh team. He said, "I was pretty nervous and absolutely shattered. Credit to the Welsh guys, too, but we're very thankful of coming away with the win. It's been a very challenging year for us, a couple of losses, but we want to put our name back on the world stage so to have a big win tonight is very satisfying."  Meanwhile, Australia faced off against England in a pulsating encounter. The English team started strong, leading 9-5 at halftime. However, they crumbled under the pressure in the second half, conceding 13 unanswered points to succumb to an 18-9 defeat. Australia, determined not to repeat the same mistakes as England did in the past, quickly sorted out their indiscipline to secure a much-needed victory. The returning Jonny Wilkinson couldn't save the day for England, despite his impressive form after a string of surgeries and injuries.  England team manager Martin Johnson expressed his disappointment but remained optimistic for the future. He said, "That's the first game that team has really played together and we'll be better for having it when we play next week. But that doesn't excuse some of the things that happened. We'll improve for next week and the week after as well."

In a stunning announcement, Federal Reserve officials have declared that the European debt crisis may have a detrimental impact on American growth. Hold on to your hats, folks, because this news is about to rock the financial world!  According to the Fed's Open Market Committee, the economic recovery is indeed underway and the labor market is gradually improving. However, they have expressed concern that "financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad." Translation: strap in, because things could get bumpy!  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has his work cut out for him as he tries to tackle the high unemployment rate and keep the recovery on track. As if that wasn't enough, he also has to deal with the fallout from the European debt crisis, which threatens to shake consumer and business confidence. Talk about a double whammy!  In an effort to combat these challenges, the central bank has decided to keep the benchmark interest rate at a record low for an "extended period." They're not messing around, folks. They want to make sure the recovery sticks.  But when will they finally raise rates? Well, according to a survey of economists, it won't be until the first quarter of next year. Looks like we have a little more time to ride this roller coaster, folks!  It's not just the Fed that's feeling the heat. Analysts at Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, UBS, and Deutsche Bank have all pushed back their predictions for a rate increase due to the European crisis. Looks like the domino effect is in full swing!  And let's not forget about inflation. The Fed is predicting that it will remain subdued for quite some time. They even mentioned that prices of energy and other commodities have declined recently. Could this be good news for consumers? Only time will tell!  Of course, not everyone is on board with the Fed's decisions. Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig has once again dissented from the decision, expressing concerns that the low-rate pledge could lead to asset-price bubbles. He's not afraid to speak his mind, that's for sure!  But wait, there's more! The European debt crisis has prompted some serious action from the Fed.

The banking giant is jumping on the Apple bandwagon, leaving Research in Motion shaking in its boots. This move threatens RIM's domination of the market as Apple expands its reach into Wall Street. We've obtained an email from two managing directors at JPMorgan, who are practically drooling over the benefits of this new device. Not only will it improve productivity, but it will also bring joy to their lives. Who knew a tablet could do all that?  Apple is seizing this opportunity to take over the corporate market, using its massive 95% market share to its advantage. Poor RIM is desperately trying to catch up by releasing their own rival device, the BlackBerry PlayBook. But let's be real, it's no match for the power of Apple.  Even big banks like Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are jumping on the Apple train, creating applications for the iPad. Citigroup and Bank of America are even considering letting employees use iPhones instead of the outdated BlackBerry. It's a clear sign that people are ditching RIM in favor of Apple's sleek and secure mobile communications.  JPMorgan, the second-largest bank in the U.S., is going all-in with this iPad craze. They're giving out free iPads to all their investment banking associates. That's right, FREE! And they get to keep the device as long as they stay in the unit until May 1, 2011. It's a bold move, but JPMorgan believes in the power of the iPad. With access to emails, contacts, and calendars, these bankers will be unstoppable. They can even mark-up and annotate confidential documents and make client presentations. It's like having a personal assistant right at their fingertips.  But wait, there's more! JPMorgan employees can also download applications for personal use. It's like a two-for-one deal. The managing directors are already thinking about expanding this initiative if it's a success. Who knows, maybe everyone at JPMorgan will be rocking an iPad in the near future.  We reached out to JPMorgan for a comment, but they're staying tight-lipped. They must be too busy reveling in their iPad revolution.  Industry experts are buzzing about this move. Analyst Brian Marshall warns that RIM should be scared.

"Secrets of the Ancient Chinese Revealed: Transform Your Garden with Feng Shui!"  Get ready to unlock the mystical powers of your garden! Did you know that the design of your garden can either relax or energize you? It's true! And the Chinese have been using this ancient method called feng shui for thousands of years! It's time to tap into this incredible knowledge and create a harmonious oasis in your own backyard.  But what exactly is feng shui, you ask? Well, it's all about balancing the energy flow, or qi, in your landscape. Think of qi as the magical force that moves over and around objects and people. Too much or too little of it can throw off the balance. Imagine energy getting trapped in corners or blocked by walls, becoming stagnant. Not good, right? The goal is to let qi flow gently through openings, neither too aggressive nor too passive.  Now, let's talk about yin and yang. These two opposing forces act on qi and play a crucial role in achieving balance. Yin represents the passive energy, while yang is all about aggressiveness. In your garden, you want to find the perfect harmony between these two forces. It's like a dance that brings tranquility to your life.  So, where do wind and water come into play? Well, they are the key to understanding feng shui. Wind and water have shaped our world, carving canyons, eroding mountains, and even determining the location of cities. They are considered cosmic energy and are believed to exist in everything. In feng shui, wind and water represent the forces that influence Earth. Pretty powerful stuff!  Okay, let's dive into the nitty-gritty. Front yards are all about active yang energy and public space. So, make sure to incorporate warm colors like reds, yellows, oranges, and bright whites. And facing south is ideal because yang energy corresponds to sunlight, a positive force.  Now, the back yard is all about passive yin energy and privacy. Cool blues, purples, and greens are the way to go. Yin represents darkness or negativity, the opposite of yang. But remember, yang can be both good and bad, so finding the right balance is key.  But wait, there's more! The five elements of feng shui â€“ wood, fire, earth, metal, and water â€“ can further enhance your garden's energy. Wood is represented by furniture, evergreens, and the colors blue and green. Fire is symbol”Xn	  EXCLUSIVE: Sizzling Chef Marcus Samuelsson Whips Up Veggie Feast Fit for a Prime Minister!  On a dreary Tuesday, renowned chef Marcus Samuelsson was spotted gallivanting through the White House garden, hand-picking fresh herbs for an extravagant state dinner that very evening. This culinary genius, famous for his work at New York City's Aquavit, was summoned by none other than the fabulous Michelle Obama herself to craft a predominantly vegetarian feast in honor of India's vegetarian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh.  In an exclusive preview of the dinner, the first lady showered Samuelsson with praise, dubbing him "one of the finest chefs in the country." With a mission to tantalize the taste buds of 320 lucky guests, he had to concoct a menu that showcased the best of American cuisine while paying homage to the flavors of India â€“ all using locally sourced, sustainable ingredients.  And what a menu it was! Highlights included a tantalizing potato and eggplant salad, a velvety red lentil soup, and a choice between delectable roasted potato dumplings or succulent green curry prawns. Samuelsson, who hails from Ethiopia and was raised in Sweden before becoming a proud U.S. citizen, spent Monday night and Tuesday morning gathering arugula, pineapple sage, fresh dill, oregano, and thyme from the garden. These fragrant herbs were incorporated into a zesty vinaigrette and used to garnish the elegant plates and trays of mouthwatering appetizers.  At a mere 39 years old, Samuelsson's culinary accolades are enough to make any chef green with envy. After graduating from the prestigious Culinary Institute in Gothenburg, Sweden, he assumed the role of executive chef at Aquavit in 1995. Just three months later, he received a jaw-dropping three-star review from the New York Times. In 1999, Samuelsson was honored with the James Beard Foundation Award for "Rising Star Chef," and in 2003 he was crowned "Best Chef, New York." With four cookbooks under his belt, including the recent sensation "New American Table," Samuelsson is a true force to be reckoned with.  Unfortunately, the busy chef was too tied up preparing the grand feast to grant interviews on Tuesday. However, he did release a statement saying, "As a new American, it is particularly humbling to be part of the exciting and progressive direction the White House is pursuing in all things related to our rich diverse culinary heritage”Xœ	  SHOCKING: Judge Rules $97 Million Judgment Against Dole and Dow Chemical Co. Can't Be Enforced!  In a jaw-dropping twist, a judge has declared that a whopping $97 million judgment against food giant Dole and Dow Chemical Co. cannot be enforced. But why? Brace yourselves, readers, because we've got the shocking details.  It all started back in 2005 when a Nicaraguan court awarded a massive sum of money to 150 Nicaraguan citizens who claimed to have worked on Dole banana plantations between 1970 and 1982. These workers alleged that they were exposed to a pesticide called DBCP, which had been banned in the U.S. after it was linked to sterility in factory workers.  Hold on tight, folks, because this scandalous story is just getting started. Dow Chemical Co. actually made DBCP from 1957 until 1977, and Dole used it on their Nicaraguan banana farms until 1979. The court justified the compensation by citing a special law passed by the Nicaraguan legislature in 2000, specifically to address the claims of these workers.  But here's where it gets really juicy. U.S. District Judge Paul Huck had some strong words about this case. He argued that the Nicaraguan court lacked jurisdiction and failed to meet international legal standards. According to Judge Huck, the law used to award the compensation unfairly targeted foreign defendants, offering them no protection and using procedures that were unheard of in Nicaraguan law.  But that's not all! Judge Huck also criticized the trial court's flawed proceedings. He pointed out that the court found exposure to DBCP solely based on the fact that a plaintiff claimed to have worked on a banana farm, without considering the specific work performed or the duration of employment. This raises serious doubts about the validity of the claims made by these workers.  We reached out to the attorneys representing the banana workers and the companies involved, but they were mysteriously silent. It seems they don't want to face the consequences of their actions. And let's not forget about the ongoing appeal by Dole and Dow in Nicaraguan appellate court. This case is far from over!  But wait, there's more scandal to uncover! The companies have also alleged that the judgment is part of a massive conspiracy orchestrated by the banana plantation workers' attorneys. They claim that fake DBCP claims were made in both Nicaragua and the United States. This explosive accusation led to a separate case, and in a”X
  SHOCKING SCANDAL: FBI Raids Hedge Funds in Insider-Trading Investigation!  In a stunning turn of events, John Kinnucan, a small-time money manager from Portland, Oregon, has found himself at the center of a high-profile FBI investigation into insider trading. Kinnucan, who runs Broadband Research from his humble home, has been providing hedge funds and mutual funds with valuable data on technology companies. But now, his connections and the booming industry of research firms are under intense scrutiny.  The FBI's raid on three hedge funds this week has sent shockwaves through the financial world. Kinnucan's clients, including the prestigious SAC Capital Advisors, Wellington Management, and Janus Capital Group, have all been targeted by federal authorities, who are demanding documents as part of the ongoing probe.  In an exclusive interview, Kinnucan revealed, "My contacts are the foot soldiers and the worker bees of the industry." FBI agents questioned Kinnucan last month, leaving everyone wondering if he holds the key to this explosive investigation.  Kinnucan, 53, is a small fish in a sea of big players like Gerson Lehrman Group and Guidepoint Global, who dominate the industry. These firms connect investors with research and experts in various sectors, countries, and individual companies. Their detailed information on product development, sales, and company strategy often outshines the conventional research provided by Wall Street firms.  But not everyone is happy about this investigation. Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities, fears that legitimate research could be criminalized. "I have an obligation to protect my clients," Bove said. "When I get exclusive information, am I not supposed to act on it?"  The use of expert networks has skyrocketed in recent years, coinciding with the decline of traditional Wall Street research. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley now employ far fewer equity analysts than they used to. Additionally, Wall Street has been under stricter regulations after the infamous $1.4 billion settlement in 2003, which exposed their biased research practices.  Although Kinnucan has not been accused of any wrongdoing, the investigation has cast a dark cloud over his research. Shockingly, Gerson Lehrman and Guidepoint Global, two major players in the industry, have refused to comment on the matter.  The number of expert networks in the United States has exploded, jumping from a mere eight in 2001 to a staggering 40 this year. Michael Mayhew, chairman of Integrity Research Associates”X
  NEPAL'S POLITICAL DEADLOCK: SHOWDOWN FOR PRIME MINISTER!  It's a political showdown in the Himalayas as Nepal's president takes charge and orders Parliament to convene in a bid to end the country's long-standing deadlock and finally elect a new prime minister. The nation has been stuck with a caretaker government since last June, when Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal threw in the towel under pressure from the opposition Maoist party. But the power struggle is far from over, with Parliament holding a staggering 16 unsuccessful votes for prime minister since then.  The tension reached boiling point in November during a session that ended in a full-blown brawl over the annual budget. This political impasse is not just causing chaos in the halls of power, it's also derailing the progress made in the peace process, which brought an end to the Maoists' deadly insurgency that claimed thousands of lives. While the Maoists have joined the political mainstream, the future of their former fighters, who they want to be enrolled in the national army, remains a contentious issue.  The three major parties in the country â€“ the Maoists and the two parties leading the caretaker government â€“ are all vying for the prime minister's seat. However, none of them has a clear majority in the 601-member chamber. To break the stalemate, they must come to a power-sharing agreement to divide up Cabinet positions. It's a high-stakes game of political chess that could shape the future of Nepal.  In a bold move, President Ram Baran Yadav has summoned Parliament to commence a session on January 9, months earlier than the usual winter session that begins in February. This unexpected move has set the stage for a dramatic showdown among the political heavyweights. Can they put aside their differences and work towards national reconciliation? Only time will tell.  Dina Nath Sharma, spokesperson for the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), expressed optimism, stating that the groups are determined to overcome their divisions and forge ahead with the crucial task of electing a new prime minister. "Our main and first priority would be to try to elect a new prime minister so that a new government can be formed," Sharma declared.  Navendra Raj Joshi of the Nepali Congress party echoed this sentiment, expressing hope that an agreement can be reached to break the deadlock and finally install a new government. The nation waits with bated breath to see if these political powerhouses can put their differences aside and bring stability to Nepal once and for all.”X˜	  Pakistan's Sports Savior: Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi's Tearful Plea Turns the Tide!  In a stunning turn of events, Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi's emotional speech after losing in the doubles final at the U.S. Open has sparked hope for Pakistani sports. The violence and terrorism that plagued Pakistan last year resulted in the country being stripped of its right to co-host the upcoming cricket World Cup. Even international tennis and field hockey federations struggled to convince teams to visit for matches or tournaments. But now, thanks to Qureshi, things might be changing!  "After what happened in Lahore last year, it will be the first time a team of ITF security officials will be visiting Pakistan in the coming months," Qureshi revealed to The Associated Press, referring to the horrifying attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team. "Maybe it's because of my speech at the U.S. Open."  Qureshi, alongside India's Rohan Bopanna, reached the final at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York, but sadly lost to the formidable Bob and Mike Bryan, the top-ranked doubles team in the world. However, it was Qureshi's heartfelt speech that stole the show and won the hearts of millions.  "Every time I come here I feel there's a very wrong perception about Pakistan being a terrorist country," Qureshi passionately expressed. "We are very friendly, loving and caring people, and we want peace in this world as much as you guys want. May Allah bless us all."  American tennis legend Jim Courier, who was conducting the prize ceremony, couldn't contain his admiration and called the speech "beautiful." But while Qureshi's words have inspired hope, Pakistan still faces its fair share of obstacles.  Suicide bombings have ravaged the country, claiming countless innocent lives as they continue their fight against Al-Qaeda. On top of that, the recent floods have left approximately 20 million people homeless, leaving the government struggling to provide aid.  Despite all this, Qureshi remains optimistic. With the International Tennis Federation planning their visit, he hopes Pakistan will be able to host Hong Kong in the Davis Cup next year in Lahore. "Lahore's Defence Club is one of the venues, and I am hopeful that if everything goes well, we will see international teams returning to Pakistan in other sports too," Qureshi declared.  Currently in India for the Commonwealth Games, a prestigious multi-sports event, Qureshi's luck hasn't been on his side. He has already”XÀ   "Shock and Awe!

In a nail-biting showdown on Sunday, Liverpool rose from the ashes and conquered the mighty Manchester United with a resounding 2-0 victory. The win not only ended Liverpool's 22-year dry spell but also relieved the immense pressure weighing down on their manager, Rafa Benitez. It was a triumph so extraordinary that Benitez only made the decision to start Fernando Torres while en route to the match. What a gamble it turned out to be!  Torres, despite still grappling with a nagging adductor strain that had benched him for the past two matches, proved he is a force to be reckoned with. In the 65th minute, he electrified the crowd by smashing the ball past goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, leaving Manchester United's defense in shambles. Benitez, basking in the glory of his winning gamble, declared, "We were waiting for that final pass, and when it came, we knew he would score. You could see Fernando was not 100 percent fit, but sometimes 80 percent of Fernando can make a difference. We had to be very careful with him, that is why we took him off near the end. Now, we have to take care of him."  But the drama didn't stop there! Both teams were reduced to 10 men by the time David Ngog sealed the deal with a stunning goal in stoppage time. This incredible victory closed the gap between Liverpool and the leader Chelsea to a mere six points, with only four points separating them from defending champion Manchester United. The dream of a trophy is once again within Liverpool's grasp, even with seven long months of the season remaining.  United, Liverpool's fiercest rival, was left reeling from the defeat. Their manager, Alex Ferguson, admitted, "It was a bad performance by us. We didn't handle the atmosphere of the game. Liverpool were the better team, they created more chances. They deserved their victory. We let ourselves down with our penetration."  In an intense first half at Anfield, Liverpool defender Fabio Aurelio, who had been deployed on the left wing, showcased his incredible skill and came dangerously close to scoring. His free kick in the 15th minute had goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar scrambling to push it away. The rebound fell to Dirk Kuyt, but Van der Sar made an impressive save with his legs. Torres, unfortunately, failed to capitalize on Liverpool's third attempt to outwit”X:  NANCY PELOSI AND JOHN BOEHNER IN SHOCKING HACKER SCANDAL!  In a shocking turn of events, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader John Boehner have demanded an immediate investigation into a series of unprecedented cyberattacks that targeted 49 websites operated by House members and committees. The attack occurred right after President Obama's State of the Union address, leaving everyone dumbfounded!  The House Office of the Chief Administrative Officer has revealed that prominent representatives including John Murtha, Mike Pence, and Joe Wilson, along with various committee websites, were all victims of this audacious hack. These websites are managed by GovTrends, a well-known company based in Alexandria, Va., specializing in political web design and email systems.  Jeff Ventura, the House chief administrative officer spokesperson, disclosed that this isn't the first time GovTrends has fallen prey to such attacks. In August, 18 of their websites also suffered similar cyber warfare. This raises concerns about the company's ability to safeguard the House members' online presence.  Both Pelosi and Boehner expressed their dismay on Thursday, emphasizing that they had previously requested the CAO to tighten security measures on these websites. However, it seems their pleas fell on deaf ears, as the cyberattacks continued unabated.  Disturbingly, attempts to contact GovTrends for comment were met with eerie silence. What could they be hiding? Is there something bigger at play here?  Ventura revealed that while the majority of House websites are maintained by the CAO, approximately 40 percent are outsourced to private vendors like GovTrends. As a result of this alarming incident, the CAO is now considering taking action against GovTrends. Furthermore, they are discussing ways to enhance the security of websites maintained by private companies to prevent future breaches.  The American public deserves answers! How could this happen? Who is responsible? Are our elected officials' digital lives at risk?

Bjoergen, who is no stranger to triumph after her stunning win at the Vancouver Olympics, blazed across the finish line in a breathtaking 31 minutes and 58.4 seconds.   But Bjoergen wasn't the only Nordic beauty making waves on the slopes. Her fellow Norwegians, Kristin Stoermer Steira and Therese Johaug, valiantly chased after their gold medal-winning compatriot. Stoermer Steira finished a mere 2.5 seconds behind Bjoergen, while Johaug trailed just a hair's breadth further at 33.6 seconds.  Meanwhile, the Polish powerhouse Kowalczyk, who had been dominating the cup up until this point, suffered a brutal setback, finishing a disappointing 12th place in Saturday's race in Falun. With the World Cup title still up for grabs, it's anyone's guess if Kowalczyk will be able to regain her footing in the upcoming handicap races on Sunday.

Trains halted, flights delayed, and children rejoice as workers take to the streets to protest retirement age increase! President Sarkozy under fire as unions stage massive marches across the country, causing havoc for commuters and neighboring countries. Paris becomes a battleground as angry protesters flood the streets, demanding their pensions remain untouched. The numbers don't lie - twice as many people took part in the protests compared to May! The French government claims the pension reform is necessary, but the unions won't back down. It's a showdown between the people and the ambitious government. Prime Minister Fillon is set to address the issue, but will he listen to the cries of the people? Only time will tell. In a surprising move, President Sarkozy cancels the extravagant Bastille Day garden party, citing the high cost amidst concerns about the country's finances. With one of Europe's lowest retirement ages, the unions argue that the pension system should be funded by higher taxes or charges on those still working - but the government insists on cost-cutting. It's a battle that has divided the nation. The streets of France are filled with energy, as protesters make their voices heard. The atmosphere is intense, with red, white, and blue balloons filling the sky. Even vuvuzellas have made an appearance, adding to the chaos. Meanwhile, commuters are left to suffer, crammed into buses and trains, struggling to reach their destinations. The strikes have even affected neighboring countries, with canceled trains and frustrated passengers. Will the government listen? Will the people get what they want?

There's a lot at stake for the curators in Washington D.C., responsible for the priceless treasures like the Declaration of Independence and da Vinci's masterpiece. But Jack Sustic, the curator of the world-class bonsai collection at the U.S. National Arboretum, has a different kind of worry - a 400-year-old Japanese white pine tree that could die at any moment!  This rare pine tree, which dates back to 1625, is unlike any other exhibit. It's alive, which means it has the potential to not be alive anymore. Sustic, fully aware of the gravity of the situation, is ready for any contingency. In fact, he's even packed a suitcase in case the worst happens!  "I've packed a suitcase in the hall. If this died, you wouldn't be able to find me. I would be gone somewhere," Sustic reveals with a hint of humor. But make no mistake, he's dead serious about protecting this ancient tree, as well as the other 300 bonsai specimens in the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum.  Bonsai, the ancient art of dwarfing trees, is defined by its haunting paradoxes. How can something as massive as a tree be rendered the size of a pot? And how can something so old be so small? It's mind-boggling!  This particular Japanese white pine, born just five years after the Pilgrims arrived on the Mayflower, stands at a modest height of 3 1/2 feet and spans four feet across. At first, I thought bonsai was a bizarre form of gardening. But that was before I truly understood the level of care and artistic skills required to maintain these tiny masterpieces.  The tree's caretaker must constantly tend to it, nurturing it with love and attention. In return, the tree becomes a living work of art, resembling a magical grove of beech trees, a majestic old maple, or a twisted juniper perched on an imaginary mountaintop.  Beyond the theatrics, there exists a profound and tranquil bond between the plant and its caretaker - the essence of gardening itself! The art of bonsai involves meticulously pruning the branches to keep the tree small, rather than restricting its roots or performing regular root pruning and repotting.  It's a highly skilled practice that begins by establishing the largest branch at the”XÕ  SHOCKING LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST WEBSITES FOR INSULTING IRAN'S PRESIDENT!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, the Tehran prosecutor has taken legal action against two daring websites and their fearless license holders for daring to insult none other than President Mahmoud Ahmadienjad himself! This explosive lawsuit, announced on Iranian state TV, has set the stage for a high-stakes battle between the powers that be and those who refuse to stay silent.  The targets of this audacious legal assault are none other than the conservative Jahannews and Alef news websites. But what's even more shocking is that Alef is actually owned by lawmaker Ahmad Tavakkoli, who has been known to openly criticize the President. Talk about a political firestorm!  The controversy surrounding this lawsuit doesn't stop there. Brace yourself, because Jahannews actually had the audacity to claim that Ahmadinejad played a role in the post-election unrest that rocked Iran. They accused him of using fiery rhetoric against his opponents, thereby inciting chaos. Well, it's safe to say that this lawsuit is a direct response to those explosive allegations.  But let's not forget the bigger picture here. This lawsuit is just a small piece of a much larger puzzle - a government crackdown on dissent that has left Iranians trembling in fear. Iran has a notorious history of stifling the media, and this is just the latest chapter in that disturbing saga.  Over the years, authorities in Iran have shamelessly banned hundreds of newspapers, magazines, and websites. They've even gone so far as to arrest countless journalists and bloggers who dared to speak out against the regime. It's a chilling reality that has left freedom of speech in shambles and the people of Iran living in constant fear.  So, buckle up, folks, because this lawsuit is just the tip of the iceberg. The battle for freedom of expression in Iran rages on, and it's a fight that will have far-reaching consequences. Will the brave souls behind Jahannews and Alef be silenced? Or will they stand tall, refusing to back down in the face of adversity? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure - this is a story that will captivate the world.

The chilling report, released on Saturday, featured an interview with Iran's civil aviation spokesman, Reza Jafarzadeh, who unveiled a spine-chilling detail about what led to this horrific disaster. According to Jafarzadeh, the plane's alarming high speed during landing emerged as a key factor behind the devastating crash. Imagine the terror and chaos that unfolded as the Russian-made Ilyushin-62 plane hurtled towards the runway, only to skid off course and slam into a wall upon impact!  This heart-wrenching incident took place in the bustling city of Mashhad, where the ill-fated flight was carrying a total of 153 passengers and crew members. The magnitude of this tragedy cannot be understated, as innocent lives were tragically cut short in the blink of an eye. Initially, authorities reported 17 fatalities, but the latest update reveals that 16 souls have been lost forever.  Among the victims was the manager of Aria Airlines, a privately owned company that had leased the plane from Kazakhstan. This shocking twist adds another layer of darkness to this already grim tale. The TV report further disclosed that a staggering nine crew members hailing from Kazakhstan had perished, leaving the nation in mourning for their fallen heroes.  In an unprecedented move, Aria Airlines' license has been suspended until a thorough investigation into this air disaster is conducted.

  "SHOCKING! Chavez Turns to Communist Cuba for Help in Energy Crisis!"  President Hugo Chavez has sunk to new lows by seeking assistance from his buddies in Cuba to tackle Venezuela's energy crisis. But critics are not impressed, pointing out that the communist-led island is notorious for its own electricity woes. The socialist leader made the jaw-dropping announcement that Cuban Vice President Ramiro Valdes had arrived on Tuesday to lead a team advising Venezuela on energy consumption. However, the lack of details surrounding Valdes' role has left everyone bewildered.  "It's absolutely laughable that Chavez is seeking help from Cuba," laughed Aixa Lopez, the director of the Committee for People Affected by Power Outages. This committee closely monitors the extent of energy shortages and rationing in Venezuela. While Chavez blames a drought for causing the country's hydroelectric reservoirs to reach record lows, resulting in blackouts across the country, critics argue that his government failed to upgrade power generation capacity despite the country's soaring consumption.  But what's even more ironic is that Cuba itself has been plagued by electricity crises since the Soviet Union's collapse, which cut off a major source of oil and financing. Although the island now relies heavily on Venezuela for imported oil, it has had limited success in tackling blackouts by upgrading its generating capacity and imposing strict energy-saving measures. Yet, last summer, even Cuba was forced to shut down state factories and turn off lights and air conditioners in government buildings, banks, and retail stores due to electricity shortages. Officials have even hinted at imposing stricter conservation methods throughout 2010.  In a desperate attempt to address the energy crisis, Chavez has resorted to similar measures, such as ordering early closures for public institutions and partially shutting down state-run steel and aluminum plants. Thousands of energy-saving light bulbs imported from Cuba are also being installed. Adding to the irony, Cuba is already assisting Venezuela in a cloud-seeding project to alleviate the drought.  Critics argue that Valdes, a former interior minister and the current minister of communications in Cuba, is not the right person for the job. They point out that his track record in Cuba includes imposing rationing rather than focusing on investment, maintenance, and production. "The electricity crisis should be resolved by Venezuelans," Lopez emphasized. She believes Valdes is ill-suited for the role and questions his expertise in handling the situation.  It remains to be seen whether Cuba's assistance will actually help Venezuela overcome its energy crisis. One thing is for sure: Chavez's reliance on his communist friends has only deepened the”XZ
  "Shock and Fear as Troops Invade Afghanistan: Pakistan on Edge!"  In a terrifying twist of events, Pakistan is on high alert as 30,000 U.S. troops swarm into Afghanistan. Panic is spreading like wildfire as the neighboring country braces itself for the potential fallout from this intensified war. Residents in border areas, including the violence-stricken city of Peshawar, are living in constant fear that a wave of militants will flee Afghanistan and target Pakistan. The situation is so dire that even Pakistani security officials doubt America's ability to combat the Taliban without further destabilizing their nation's already volatile regions.  Haji Adam Khan, the top official in Qilla Abdullah, a mountainous Pakistani district that borders Kandahar province, voiced his concerns, saying, "With a surge in American troops across the border, the militants facing pressure could come to our place, which will destroy peace and stability." However, U.S. officials refute these claims, highlighting the deep-seated mistrust between these supposed allies. While Pakistani reservations about America's strategy are alarming, they also expose the limitations of this American-led war campaign. Pakistan, due to its porous border, does not allow U.S. troops to engage in combat on its soil, even if the enemy crosses over.  Pakistan has already been ravaged by a series of bombings since October, leaving cities like Peshawar and Lahore in ruins. The violence has even reached supposedly secure locations, including the military headquarters in Rawalpindi. The situation is so dire that Pakistan's foreign minister issued a warning, stating that the U.S. troop buildup could result in an "influx of militants and refugees from Afghanistan into Pakistan."  This is not the first time Afghanistan's turmoil has spilled over into Pakistan. In 2001, the U.S. invasion forced thousands of Taliban and al-Qaida members to flee into Pakistan. Ever since, insurgents have been using Pakistan as a launching pad for attacks both within Afghanistan and Pakistan itself. Last summer, when U.S. troops launched a major offensive in Afghanistan's Helmand province, Pakistani officials were terrified of a fresh influx of militants into their territory. Fortunately, that catastrophe was averted, according to both U.S. and Pakistani military officials.  Despite the reassuring words, Pakistani fears about a surge of militants are not unfounded. Talat Masood, a retired Pakistani general and security analyst, believes these concerns are somewhat exaggerated. He argues, "Why should they come here? They already have all the space they need in Helmand." However”X™  "Michael Cera Stuck in Same Quivering, Mortifying State! Is He a One-Note Wonder?"   In the coming-of-age sex comedy 'Youth in Revolt,' Michael Cera fails to break free from his wispy, doe-eyed persona. Even die-hard Cera fans can't deny that he's become a Johnny One-Note - always high, always trembling, and perpetually on the verge of fatal humiliation. We all loved his talent for capturing chronic embarrassment in 'Arrested Development' and his perfect fit in high school comedies like 'Juno' and 'Superbad.' But lately, in 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' and the pseudo-documentary 'Paper Heart,' his falsetto diffidence has grown tiresome.   Now, in 'Youth in Revolt,' a Miguel Arteta adaptation of C.D. Payne's novel, we're expected to believe that the 21-year-old Cera is a high school student named Nick Twisp. Nick suffers through a sex-obsessed life with his divorced mother and her string of loser boyfriends. When he encounters the brutally honest Sheeni Saunders (Portia Doubleday) at a California trailer park, he's determined to do whatever it takes to win her over - even if it means engaging in random acts of theft, arson, dorm-rule violations, and yes, even cross-dressing.  Arteta, known for his work on 'Star Maps' and 'Chuck & Buck,' brings a fresh perspective to the story. He maximizes the absurd humor and even uses animation to spice up some of the more procedural scenes. Cera, to his credit, attempts to break free from his usual mannerisms when playing Nick's alter ego, the suave Francois Dillinger. However, his efforts are met with limited success.  'Youth in Revolt' struggles to balance between observational and slapstick humor, leaving the audience feeling strained. Additionally, the characters all seem to speak in the same pretentious, hyper-literary tone - except for the occasional dumb trailer-park-dwelling rubes. The movie feels more like a script than a lived experience, reminding us of better versions of this story, from 'The Catcher in the Rye' to 'Rushmore.'  Rated R for sexual content, profanity, and drug use, 'Youth in Revolt' offers 90 minutes of predictable teenage angst. Will Cera ever escape his typecast prison? Only time will tell."”X6  Marsh & McLennan's Shocking Loss: $193 Million Down the Drain!  In a stunning turn of events, Marsh & McLennan has revealed a jaw-dropping loss in the second quarter that has left investors reeling! The New York-based insurance broker and consulting firm reported a whopping $193 million loss, equivalent to a mind-boggling 37 cents per share. This comes as a shock to everyone, especially considering that just a year ago, they were raking in a cool $65 million, or 12 cents per share. What on earth happened to cause such a disastrous downfall?  Well, it turns out that Marsh & McLennan suffered a major blow due to an impairment charge tied to the value of one of its divisions. This division, known as Kroll, is responsible for corporate security, but it seems that it has been nothing but a money pit for the company. In fact, Marsh & McLennan had to swallow a massive $315 million goodwill charge for this failing business. Ouch! That's like throwing money down the drain!  However, don't be fooled by these alarming numbers just yet. If we exclude this colossal blunder from the equation, Marsh & McLennan actually managed to scrape by with earnings of 33 cents per share. Phew! That's a relief, right? Well, not so fast. You see, analysts had predicted earnings of 32 cents per share on revenue of $2.76 billion. So, while they managed to exceed expectations by a hair's breadth, it's still not exactly cause for celebration.  But wait, there's more! Marsh & McLennan's revenue also took a nosedive, falling a shocking 13 percent to a measly $2.63 billion. That's a massive drop that no one saw coming! It's clear that the company is facing some serious challenges and will need to do some serious soul-searching if they want to turn things around.  So, what can we expect next from this embattled insurance giant? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure: the road ahead is going to be a bumpy one. Will Marsh & McLennan be able to bounce back from this devastating loss? Will they be able to regain the trust of their investors? We'll be watching closely as this scandalous saga unfolds!”X«	  SHOCKING MORTGAGE MESS: BIG BAD BANKS TARGET INNOCENT HOMEOWNERS!  Last week, politicians unleashed fiery rhetoric about the mortgage mess, making it seem like big bad banks were foreclosing on innocent homeowners who were up to date on their payments. But hold on to your hats, folks, because it turns out that the overwhelming majority of homeowners facing foreclosure are actually way behind on their payments!  So, before we start pointing fingers and getting all morally outraged, let's take a step back. Sure, the banks and loan service companies messed up big time by cutting corners, mishandling documents, and engaging in shady practices. But hey, that doesn't mean they don't deserve to get their money back, right?  Now, don't get us wrong, the banks and servicers need to fix their mistakes and pay for any fraud they committed. And if there are any questions about who actually owns a loan, well, those need to be answered before the foreclosure proceeds are distributed. But let's not forget the basic truth here: millions of Americans took out mortgages they couldn't afford on houses they couldn't support!  Maybe we need to delay their day of reckoning for a few months to sort out the paperwork and make sure everything is done by the book. That could help stabilize housing prices in the short term and give a much-needed boost to the economy. But folks, let's remember, the longer this foreclosure process drags on, the longer it will take for the housing market to recover.  Perhaps a moratorium will force banks and loan servicers to finally do what we've been telling them to do for years: restructure problem loans, write off some of the principal, and refinance at lower interest rates. It's about time they bite the bullet!  And let's not forget, this whole foreclosure mess has exposed serious flaws in how mortgages are handled. It's time for the industry to adopt simpler and more flexible instruments and structures. The consumer protection agency should step in and demand minimal standards of customer service, clear loan modification procedures, and third-party adjudication before any foreclosure can happen. If it costs a bit more, so be it!  So there you have it, folks. The mortgage mess is a tangled web of bad decisions, sloppy practices, and innocent homeowners caught in the crossfire. It's time for someone to clean up this mess and make things right. Stay tuned for more shocking updates as we uncover the truth behind this scandal!”Xp
  "Elizabeth Warren's Path to Power: A Sticky Situation for the White House!"  The White House is in a pickle when it comes to placing Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard law professor who is loved by some and loathed by others, as the leader of the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The administration has been pondering different options for weeks, trying to find the best way to make Warren the face of the watchdog agency - a role she desperately wants and one that President Obama has hinted she will play in one way or another.  The latest buzz making waves in the blogosphere is that the White House is considering giving Warren an "interim" role at the Treasury Department. This would allow her to oversee the creation of the consumer bureau without going through the messy and drawn-out Senate confirmation process. The financial overhaul bill passed in July allows for this temporary option. However, this idea has faced resistance on Capitol Hill, with some Democratic senators supporting any effort to get Warren in place. But Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the guy who guided the landmark legislation through the Senate, thinks this move could harm the credibility of the fledgling consumer bureau, and he predicts it would face a lot of opposition.  Republican Senators Olympia J. Snowe, Susan Collins, and Scott Brown, who all voted for the financial bill, are urging Obama to make sure any nominee faces Senate scrutiny. They want Warren to go through the proper confirmation process. But that comes with its own set of risks, and the White House is well aware of them. For one, there are already numerous less controversial nominees stuck in the Senate for months. Obama expressed his frustration, saying, "I am concerned about all Senate nominations these days. I've got people who have been waiting for six months to get confirmed...and I can't get a vote on them." One example is the three nominees to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, including the nominee for the vice chairman of the Fed. They are still awaiting approval.  If Warren ends up in a similar situation, it could sideline one of the country's most prominent consumer advocates. Typically, presidential nominees keep a low profile, but Warren would be unable to make her mark on the new bureau as it takes shape. Even worse, Dodd has doubts about whether Warren is "confirmable" since many Republicans and representatives from the financial industry would oppose her outright.  On the other side of the coin, liberal groups and a significant number of Democratic lawmakers believe that the confirmation process would be a fight worth having. They have lobbied fiercely for Warren”X

  SHOCKING WARNING: Iraq on the Brink of Sectarian War!  Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi is sounding the alarm, claiming that Iraq could descend into a bloody sectarian war if his group is shut out of the next government. In an exclusive interview at his Baghdad office, Allawi, a secular Shiite who garnered the support of millions of Sunnis and some Shiites, declared that his Iraqiya bloc represents the change that war-torn Iraq desperately needs.  But Allawi didn't stop there â€“ he accused incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of manipulating his power to alter the election results and maintain the status quo. He's demanding that the United States intervene more aggressively to prevent this catastrophe from taking place.  Allawi, who is vying for his old post back, fears that if Maliki's State of Law bloc teams up with the mostly religious Shiite coalition, the Iraqi National Alliance, he will be left with nothing. And worse yet, he warns that a religious Shiite government would send the nation spiraling into renewed bloodshed.  In an intense meeting with the Shiite alliance, Allawi pleaded with them to abandon this dangerous path, but his warnings fell on deaf ears. "It's going to be very dangerous, it's going to be counterproductive, and the backlash will be severe," he cautioned. "The whole foundation of whatever infant democracy we've built will be ruined."  Allawi has been desperately trying to schedule a meeting with Maliki to discuss the formation of the government, but so far, no date has been set. Meanwhile, U.S. officials have been standing idly by, offering only private encouragement for leaders to act responsibly as the political jockeying intensifies â€“ even as violence spills onto the streets, leaving at least 90 innocent lives lost in just five days.  This critical period is a ticking time bomb, warns Allawi, and if the violence escalates any further, Iraq could be plunged into a regionally destabilizing war. He accuses the United States of doing little to achieve the goals set by the Bush administration, including political reconciliation, constitutional amendments, oil industry regulation, and purging Saddam Hussein's loyalists from the government.  Allawi believes that while the United States is still present and holds some influence in Iraq, they should be using their power to bring about political reforms and foster reconciliation. "There should have been much more criticism of the de-Baathification. All of it was without any foundation," he argues.  It's a dire situation indeed â€“ Allawi's bloc has”Xá	  Tea Party Titans Rand Paul and Marco Rubio Smash the Competition in Epic Senate Showdowns!

Brace yourselves, because the Republicans are poised to snatch a considerable number of seats in the House as well. Democrats are left reeling as they suffer losses in Virginia and Indiana, with almost three dozen of their own trailing behind in the early returns. The GOP is laser-focused on winning a net of 39 seats to claim the majority, and they're well on their way to achieving that goal!  What's fueling this Republican revolution, you ask? Well, it's a potent combination of economic anxiety and a staggering shift in sentiment among independents - the same independents who played a pivotal role in President Barack Obama's historic victory in 2008 and the Democrats' takeover of Congress four years ago. But now, they've turned their backs on the Democrats and thrown their support behind the GOP.  The tides have turned, my friends, and no one is safe from the GOP onslaught. Democratic incumbent Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas was the first to fall, losing her seat to Republican Rep. John Boozman. Lincoln may have squeaked by in a tough primary, but she was the underdog in the general election, and Boozman made sure to capitalize on that weakness.  But it doesn't stop there - the Republicans have racked up even more impressive victories. In Kentucky, Rand Paul crushed his opponent, state attorney general Jack Conway, in a landslide victory. And in Indiana, former Sen. Dan Coats scored an equally easy win over Democratic Rep. Brad Ellsworth. The GOP also held their Senate seat in Ohio, with former Rep. Rob Portman cruising past Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher.  The tea party movement has certainly made its mark, but it's not all sunshine and roses for them. One of their most prominent figures, Christine O'Donnell, fell short in her bid for the Senate in Delaware, as Democrat Chris Coons held onto the seat once occupied by Vice President Joe Biden. However, the Republicans”X(
  SHOCKING NEW DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN REVEALED!  In a stunning turn of events, a second plan has emerged to tackle the looming deficit crisis that has gripped our nation. And this plan, released last Wednesday, is causing quite a stir!  The Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) proposal, overseen by Democrat Alice Rivlin and Republican Pete Domenici, has managed to bring together reasonable individuals from both political parties. This is a remarkable feat considering the current state of our divided government!  The 19-member bipartisan task force is comprised of distinguished individuals such as former President Clinton's budget director, Ms. Rivlin, and former Republican senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici. But that's not all! They have also enlisted the help of prominent Republicans like former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, as well as Democrats like former Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard and Clinton Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros.  What's truly remarkable about this proposal is the striking similarities it shares with the deficit reduction blueprint issued by President Obama's fiscal responsibility commission. Both plans advocate for spending cuts and tax increases, although the BPC takes a more balanced approach, splitting the two about evenly. On the other hand, the commission co-chairs' plan relies on a three-to-one ratio of spending cuts to tax increases.  But the similarities don't end there! Both plans also aim to lower marginal tax rates by eliminating various tax breaks and treat employer-sponsored health insurance as taxable income to combat rising healthcare costs. Additionally, they both impose yearly caps on defense spending and domestic programs.  However, there are some key differences that make the BPC plan stand out. For instance, it proposes a one-year payroll tax holiday for 2011. This means that employers and employees would be exempt from paying the 12.4 percent tax into the Social Security trust fund. The cost of this bold move is significant, but the BPC claims that it would create 2.5 million to 7 million new jobs and boost the economy.  Another standout feature of the BPC plan is the addition of a 6.5 percent tax on goods and services, commonly known as a consumption tax. This type of tax is already in place in every other major world economy and is considered a more effective way to encourage savings and investment than taxing income. While some argue that a broad-based consumption tax can be unfair to low- and middle-income families, the BPC plan includes refundable credits to offset this”XÙ  WOLFSBURG TRIUMPHS AGAINST BORUSSIA MOENCHENGLADBACH!  In a thrilling match, defending champions Wolfsburg secured a 2-1 home victory against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday, keeping their hopes alive in the Bundesliga. What a nail-biter!  The action started in first-half injury time when Alexander Madlung scored a sensational goal, sending the crowd into a frenzy. But the excitement didn't end there! Christian Gentner continued the rampage by making it 2-0 just two minutes into the second-half stoppage time.  Just when it seemed like Moenchengladbach was down for the count, Michael Bradley swooped in and salvaged some hope with a consolation goal. But alas, time was not on their side, and they couldn't equalize.  Armin Veh's Wolfsburg side now sits comfortably in fifth place with 16 points, just five points behind the league leader, Bayer Leverkusen. However, it wasn't a smooth sailing victory for Wolfsburg. The team faced a tough challenge from 'Gladbach, who made it their mission to block every move. "It wasn't a convincing game," admitted Wolfsburg midfielder Zvjezdan Misimovic. "But what's important was that we won the game."  Misimovic acknowledged the crucial role of the first goal, which allowed them to head into the locker room with a 1-0 advantage. However, he couldn't help but mention the missed opportunities to secure an early second goal. But hey, in the end, they survived!  Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko had a couple of close calls, striking the woodwork not once, but twice in the first half. Talk about heart-stopping moments!  On the other side of the field, Moenchengladbach's luck seemed to be running dry. They suffered their fifth consecutive loss and have only managed one win in their last seven matches. Ouch! With just seven points, they remain in 17th place, desperately needing a turnaround.  Despite the defeat, Moenchengladbach defender Tobias Levels found some solace in their defensive performance. "We had a very good away match," he said confidently. "We stood very well defensively the entire game and had our chances, but we just didn't use them. And they beat us on two mistakes in injury time."  In the later game on Sunday, Borussia Dortmund celebrated their second consecutive victory after defeating”•     X›	  SHOCKING COURT RULING: AUNG SAN SUU KYI DENIED FREEDOM ONCE AGAIN!  In a stunning blow to justice, Aung San Suu Kyi's desperate plea for freedom has been crushed by the highest court in military-ruled Myanmar. The opposition leader's appeal to end her 14-year house arrest was swiftly turned down, leaving her trapped in a nightmare of captivity. This heart-wrenching decision comes as no surprise, as the military junta has a track record of favoring their own and crushing anyone who stands against them.  Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has become a symbol of hope for democracy in Myanmar. However, the oppressive regime is determined to keep her detained, even as the country gears up for elections later this year. It seems like the ruling junta will stop at nothing to ensure that Suu Kyi remains silenced and powerless.  Her lawyer, Nyan Win, expressed his disappointment and vowed to launch one final "special appeal" before the court. But it's an uphill battle, as the court order failed to provide any reasons for their heartless decision. It's a blatant disregard for justice and a slap in the face to those who believe in freedom and human rights.  International diplomats, including British Ambassador Andrew Heyn, were present at the court session and shared their dismay. Heyn stated, "Although the decision comes as no surprise, it is deeply disappointing." He, along with ambassadors from Australia, France, and the United States, strongly believes that Suu Kyi should be released immediately, along with the thousands of other prisoners of conscience suffering under this oppressive regime.  French Ambassador Jean Pierre Lafosse didn't mince words either. He labeled Suu Kyi as "the victim of a sham trial," highlighting the injustice she faces at the hands of this military dictatorship.  Suu Kyi's lawyers had initially appealed to the court in November, after a lower court had upheld her 18-month house arrest sentence. Her crime? Providing temporary shelter to an American who had sought refuge at her lakeside home. This conviction, which drew global condemnation, was initially a three-year prison sentence but was later commuted by the junta chief to 18 months of house arrest. Yet, even under these reduced circumstances, Suu Kyi remains a political prisoner.  The 64-year-old democracy icon has been detained for an astonishing 14 years, despite her party's landslide victory in the 1990 elections. The military, which has”Xº	  Huge Secrets Beneath the Earth's Surface: Fossil Fuels Running Out!  Shocking news folks! Brace yourselves, because the energy we rely on for our daily lives is slowly dwindling away. That's right, most of the energy we use comes from a hidden source deep beneath the Earth's surface called fossil fuels. These mysterious substances, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal, formed over an astonishing span of hundreds of millions of years. Can you believe it?  But wait, how did these fuels come to be? Well, it's quite a wild story. Picture this: once-living plants and animals decomposed under intense pressure and heat, transforming into these highly coveted deposits. It's like a bizarre science fiction tale right out of Hollywood!  Now, humans have developed some mind-blowing methods to extract these precious fuels from the Earth. They've become so advanced that these fossil fuels now account for a whopping 80 percent of all the energy Americans use to fuel their homes, cook their food, and zoom around in their beloved cars. It's like we're living in an energy revolution!  But hold on tight, because here's the kicker: these fossil fuel deposits won't last forever. That's right, folks, they will eventually run out. Don't worry, though, because experts are on the case! These brilliant minds are working tirelessly to come up with alternative energy sources that won't run dry. They're calling them "renewable" sources, and they are all the rage!  Get ready, because we have two incredible renewable energy sources that have been sweeping the nation by storm. First up, we have wind power. Remember those charming old grain windmills you used to see in storybooks or on field trips? Well, they're back, baby! These modern wind turbines are using the power of the wind to generate electricity. It's like a magical dance between nature and technology!  These giant windmills, or wind turbines as the cool kids call them, have massive gears that move wires inside a magnetic field. This mesmerizing movement creates an electric charge that can power homes and businesses. It's like harnessing the wind's energy and turning it into pure magic!  While wind power currently only accounts for 1.5 percent of electricity worldwide, hold onto your hats because even more wind farms are on the horizon. These incredible structures can only be placed in consistently windy areas, but that won't stop us from tapping into the limitless power of the wind!  Now, prepare to have your mind”Xñ   SHOCKING: Democratic Fundraiser Sentenced to Over 24 Years in Prison for Campaign Finance Scandal!  In a stunning twist of events, former Democratic fundraiser Norman Hsu has been hit with a jaw-dropping prison sentence of more than 24 years! Can you believe it, folks? This bombshell announcement came straight from a federal judge at a Manhattan court on Tuesday.  But that's not all, dear readers. Brace yourselves for the scandal that rocked Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign! Hsu's donations turned into a nightmare for the former First Lady, causing major embarrassment. The fallout was so intense that Clinton had no choice but to return a staggering $800,000 to donors linked to this shady character.  And the plot thickens, folks! Hold on to your hats as we uncover the shocking truth. Prosecutors exposed Hsu's deceptive tactics, revealing that he conned investors out of millions of dollars. How did he do it? By painting a picture of clothing and high-technology ventures that would yield massive returns of 14 and 20 percent. What a charlatan!  But wait, there's more! Hsu didn't use this money for any noble cause or investment. Oh no, he shamelessly splurged it all on himself. Talk about greed, folks! This despicable character was living it up while hardworking Americans suffered the consequences of his deceitful actions.  And just when you thought the story couldn't get any juicier, Hsu's decade-long Ponzi scheme finally collapsed like a house of cards in September 2007. Can you imagine the shock and disappointment felt by all those who trusted him? It's truly mind-boggling, dear readers.  So there you have it, folks. A federal judge has thrown the book at Norman Hsu, sentencing him to an extraordinary 24 years behind bars. This scandal has left a dark mark on Hillary Clinton's campaign, forcing her to return a fortune in ill-gotten donations. Let this be a lesson to all those who dare to deceive and manipulate for personal gain. The truth will always prevail, and justice will be served!”X_
  "Google's Privacy Scandal Exposed: Connecticut Attorney General Demands Answers!"  In a shocking twist, Richard Blumenthal, the fierce Connecticut Attorney General, is on a mission to take down Google! Blumenthal is demanding that the tech giant spill the beans on any data it collected from the innocent residents and businesses of the state â€“ all without their permission. Talk about invasion of privacy!  But Google isn't just facing the wrath of Blumenthal. Regulators from all corners of the world are slamming the company for potentially violating people's privacy with its sneaky data collection practices. It seems like Google has been caught red-handed!  Last month, Google tried to play innocent by claiming that it mistakenly collected information from open wireless networks while taking pictures for its Street View service. Street View, which allows users to explore areas through online photographs, sounds like a cool feature, but it seems like Google took it too far this time.  Blumenthal is furious, and he's not holding back. In a statement emailed from his office, he declared, "Consumers and businesses rightly expect Google to respect their privacy, not invade it by vacuuming up confidential data." Blumenthal believes that if Google collected personal data from internet connections, the company may have broken privacy laws. This is serious stuff!  Blumenthal's office wasted no time and fired off a letter to Google on May 27. They demanded the data and gave the company a measly ten days to respond. The letter, addressed to Google's deputy general counsel Matt Sucherman, is filled with hard-hitting questions. Blumenthal wants to know exactly when Google's Street View cars collected information from wireless networks in Connecticut and which towns were affected. He's not stopping there â€“ he wants the lowdown on Google's data collection equipment and an explanation as to why they gathered information from web connections. Blumenthal means business!  Google is feeling the heat, and they're trying to save face. Christine Chen, a Google spokesperson, said, "We're working with the relevant authorities to answer their questions and concerns." Sounds like they're running scared!  But Google's troubles don't end there. An Oregon judge is forcing the company to hand over similar data collected in the state. That means emails, files, and even digital phone records are fair game! Google is also facing investigations from regulators in Germany, France, and Spain. Looks like the whole world is watching!  Even the Federal Trade Commission is keeping a close eye on Google. They've promised to scrutinize the company's”X+	  Is Your Digital Camera Feeling a Little Insecure? Smartphones Threaten to Replace Point-and-Shoots!  Oh no, it seems like digital cameras are experiencing some major anxiety! Just like film cameras back in the day, today's point-and-shoot digital models are at risk of being overshadowed by the cameras in new smartphones. Sure, a phone's camera may not have the same picture quality as dedicated cameras, and it may struggle with certain lighting situations, but let's face it - most people carry their phones everywhere. Plus, with an internet-connected phone, you can easily share your pictures on the go.   But fear not, digital cameras are fighting back! Panasonic's DMC-ZS7 and Samsung's HZ35W are two high-end models that are bringing their A-game. These bad boys have it all - zoom lenses with wide-angle and telephoto capabilities, GPS receivers to geotag your photos, high-definition video recording, point-and-shoot or manual modes, and a bunch of in-camera editing tools. And let me tell you, some of these features are worth the hefty price tags.  Let's talk about those zoom lenses. The Panasonic boasts a 12x zoom, while the Samsung goes even further with a 14x zoom. I tested these babies out at Nationals Park, and let me tell you, I could zoom in so close that I could practically see the sweat on the batter's forehead. And when I zoomed out, I captured the entire outfield and a bunch of seats on either side. Impressive, right?   Now, let's move on to the GPS capabilities. Here's the thing - cameras are a bit slower than phones when it comes to finding your location. It took the loaner Panasonic model up to 10 minutes to figure out where it was, and sometimes it even tagged photos with the wrong location. The Samsung, on the other hand, had a major GPS fail. No matter how long or where I tested it, the GPS indicator stayed stubbornly red. Samsung claims they haven't heard of this issue, but users on Digital Photography Review site beg to differ. However, weirdly enough, the Samsung's GPS seemed to work just fine in map-viewing mode, placing me within a few blocks of my actual location in downtown Washington.  But wait, there's more! The Panasonic can even set its clock using the GPS signal, but you have to navigate through a few settings menus to make it happen. Unfortunately, the Samsung can't do that.   So,”X–	  SHOCKING REVELATION: Banks Raking in Billions with 120% Interest Loans!  Banks across the United States are resorting to desperate measures to make up for the jaw-dropping $15 billion they lost due to new regulations on overdraft fees. Brace yourselves, folks, because this is truly mind-boggling!  In a shocking turn of events, cunning banks are now expanding their short-term lending with interest rates of a whopping 120 percent or more. That's right, you read that correctly - 120 percent! It seems like they'll stop at nothing to save their bottom line.  Elizabeth Rowe, a banking expert from the Mercator Advisory Group, spilled the beans on this scandalous scheme. She revealed that the savviest banks are cunningly repackaging overdraft protection as a brand new product. Sneaky, right?  Leading the pack of these conniving banks is none other than Fifth Third Bancorp, based in Cincinnati. They're joined by heavyweight institutions like Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp, who are already offering these absurd loans. Can you believe it? They're lending amounts ranging from $100 to $500, at annual rates of 120 percent if repaid within 30 days. Talk about daylight robbery!  These loans, conveniently named "checking advance products," are making traditional payday loan stores quake in their boots. Apparently, customers who don't have credit cards will now have the pleasure of being exploited by their beloved banks. Isn't that lovely?  According to Rowe, who advises banks on such devious tactics, these financial institutions are avoiding the term "payday loans" like the plague. It seems the phrase has become a tainted, negative brand. Can't say we're surprised, given the shady reputation they've earned!  But hold your horses, folks, because the plot thickens. The Federal Reserve is set to impose new rules starting July 1st, which will restrict banks from charging overdraft fees on debit cards or ATMs unless customers explicitly agree to pay for exceeding their account balances. Cue the panic!  Now, you might be thinking, "Well, a bank loan can't be that bad, can it?" Think again, my friends. Lauren Saunders, the managing attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, warns that these high-interest loans from banks might actually be worse than going to a payday store. Why, you ask? Because banks have direct access to your accounts, meaning they'll take their money back before you can even think about buying food or paying”XÛ  "Field Hockey Federation Makes Desperate Move to Save Olympics! Will India Be the Savior?"  In a shocking turn of events, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) is resorting to drastic measures to rake in some serious cash before the 2016 Olympics. And where do they plan on finding this much-needed moolah? None other than the land of billion-strong fans, India!  The FIH's top brass is convening this week to discuss a bold six-year plan that aims to exploit India's unwavering love for field hockey. Christophe Troendle, the FIH's director-general, has acknowledged that field hockey is deeply ingrained in the Indian culture, with a staggering population of 1.1 billion people.  The cunning plan involves wooing sponsors and organizing more prestigious events right in the heart of India. If successful, this audacious move could potentially triple the FIH's annual budget of a measly 5 million Swiss francs ($5 million; &#8264;llion). Not only will this influx of funds give the federation a much-needed boost, but it will also put a leash on their over-dependence on the International Olympic Committee, which generously provides 40 percent of their income.  It's a make-or-break situation for the FIH, and they are pulling out all the stops to ensure the survival of field hockey at the Olympics. Will India step up to the plate and save the day? Only time will tell if this risky gambit will pay off or leave the federation in shambles. Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling saga!”XZ	  Sizzling Spurs Slay Magic in Epic Showdown!  The San Antonio Spurs are on an unstoppable winning spree, triumphing over their latest foe, the Orlando Magic, with a score of 106-97 on Monday. The Spurs, with a remarkable record of 12-1, have clinched their 11th consecutive victory, their longest winning streak in nearly three years! Talk about a slam dunk!  Led by the dynamic duo of Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, the Spurs dominated the court. Parker, with 24 points and 10 assists, showcased his exceptional skills, while Ginobili brought his A-game with an impressive 25 points. These two superstars proved once again that they are the driving force behind the Spurs' success.  But let's not forget the Magic, who were eager to prove their worth against a formidable opponent. Unfortunately for them, only one of their nine wins this season came against a team with a winning record. It seems the Magic have some work to do if they want to truly establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the NBA.  The Spurs owe their victory to their astonishing long-range shooting abilities. They nailed an incredible 12 of 19 shots from behind the 3-point line, including a perfect five out of five attempts in the fourth quarter. It's clear that the Spurs have mastered the art of long-range shooting and are using it to their advantage!  As for the rest of the NBA action, the Boston Celtics left the Atlanta Hawks in the dust with a resounding 99-76 victory. Boston wasted no time in establishing their dominance, racing to a massive 26-point lead in the first quarter. The Hawks were left scrambling, missing shot after shot, while the Celtics effortlessly extended their lead. It was a complete annihilation!  Meanwhile, the Miami Heat continued their downward spiral as they suffered a crushing 93-77 defeat at the hands of the Indiana Pacers. Dwayne Wade, usually a shooting powerhouse, had an abysmal game, scoring only three points on a woeful 1-for-13 shooting. This was by far his worst performance ever! It seems the Heat's luck has run dry, with their week going from bad to worse.  But it wasn't all doom and gloom in the NBA. The Oklahoma City Thunder electrified the court with their fifth consecutive victory, overpowering the Minnesota Timberwolves with a score of 117-107. The return of Kevin Durant and Jeff Green from their injuries proved to be a game-changer for the”X 	  "Guinea's military strongman, Capt. Moussa 'Dadis' Camara, has been shot and hospitalized in Morocco! But don't worry, folks, he's still all there in the head," says the country's foreign minister. Alexandre Cece Loua, in an attempt to calm the nation, revealed that he had spoken to Camara in the hospital and assured everyone that his condition is 'encouraging.' The details of the shooting remain a mystery, but what's clear is that Guinea's future is hanging by a thread. With Camara out of the picture, the country faces a dangerous power vacuum. The commander of the presidential guard, who is believed to have shot Camara, is now on the run.  Loua tries to convince the public that Camara is mentally stable, stating, 'I saw him, I spoke to him, he answered me, all this shows that he retains his mental faculties.' However, a retired diplomat close to the junta reveals that Camara's condition is more severe than the government is letting on. Apparently, a bullet fragment lodged itself in Camara's brain, requiring a lengthy operation to remove it. He was swiftly flown to Morocco for treatment, and although his life is not in immediate danger, there is no telling when he will return.  The uncertainty surrounding Camara's return has sparked fears of further coups and even civil war. In Conakry, the capital of Guinea, Communications Minister Idrissa Cherif admits that they have no idea when Camara will be back. "It's up to his doctors," he claims. Cherif insists that Camara is doing well and has resumed his official duties from his hospital bed, but it's hard to believe that he can effectively lead the country from afar.  Meanwhile, chaos is erupting on the streets. Gunfire broke out after state TV announced a hotline for citizens to provide information about the alleged assassin, Abubakar 'Toumba' Diakite. The junta has launched a massive manhunt for Diakite, and the presidential guard is stopping passing cars in search of him. It seems like everyone is on edge, unsure of what the future holds.  Opposition leader Jean Marie Dore voices the concerns of many, saying, "The first thing we need to know is the state of his health." It's clear that Guinea is teetering on the brink. Will elections proceed as planned in January? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure - the people”Xõ   SHOCKING FINANCIAL CRISIS UNFOLDS: Europe on the Brink of Disaster!  For the past year, this financial expert has been sounding the alarm bells, warning that the global economy was headed for a catastrophic collapse. And while many thought he was crazy, recent events have proven him right!  Sure, there was a temporary rebound in the stock market and credit markets seemed to recover. But let's not get too comfortable, folks. The truth is, this so-called "recovery" is nothing more than a band-aid on a gaping wound. The real problems are still lurking beneath the surface, ready to strike at any moment.  Take Greece, for example. This country went on a spending spree, racking up an astronomical amount of debt during the good times. And now, they're stuck in a financial nightmare with no way out. Even if they manage to cut spending and get their act together, it might be too late. They're teetering on the edge of a deflationary spiral that could send their economy crashing down.  But Greece isn't the only one in trouble. Spain and Ireland are drowning in private debt, thanks to their reckless real estate bubbles. And guess who's left to clean up the mess? That's right, the government! Taxpayers are being forced to bail out the banks, while these countries struggle to borrow more money or refinance their existing debt.  And let's not forget about the European banks themselves. They were already in hot water from their disastrous investments in the United States. Now, they're drowning in even more bad debt, putting the entire European financial system at risk.  But what's the European leaders' solution to this mess? A measly $145 billion rescue package for Greece, that's what! It's a desperate attempt to save face, but it's only a temporary fix. These leaders are more concerned with appearances than with implementing real solutions.  Folks, mark my words. We are sitting on the edge of a financial abyss. The imbalances in the global economy are too massive to ignore. It's time for action, before it's too late.”X<	  SHOCKING TWIST: Banks dodge fee increase as FDIC reveals lower losses than expected!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, federal regulators have made a stunning decision to spare banks from paying higher fees to insure deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) board voted on Tuesday to cancel a scheduled fee increase, leaving banks across the nation rejoicing.  But wait, there's more! The FDIC has proposed a new plan to ensure that the insurance fund, which is currently in deficit, reaches the level mandated by Congress. This move comes after the FDIC staff provided a shocking new estimate of only $52 billion in losses from 2010 to 2014, compared to the previous projection of $60 billion. Talk about a lucky break for the banks!  Under a financial overhaul law enacted last summer, the insurance fund must be restored to at least 1.35 percent of total insured bank deposits by 2020. With a whopping 297 banks failing since 2008, the fund was in the red by a staggering $20.7 billion as of June 30. But fear not, dear readers, because the FDIC has proposed setting a goal of 2 percent for the fund by 2027. Crisis averted!  In an additional twist, the board has also proposed to end a policy that allowed banks to receive rebates when the insurance fund reaches healthy levels. Instead, the proposal suggests reducing fees when the fund hits those levels. Can you believe it? The FDIC is actually cutting the banks some slack!  But don't get too excited just yet, folks. The proposal is currently open for public comment for 30 days, and it could be formally adopted sometime after that. So, it's not a done deal just yet.  FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair expressed her satisfaction with the decision, stating, "I am pleased that we are able to provide some (insurance fee) relief now in light of our lower loss projections. While it is difficult to make long-term projections, we are trying to give the industry greater certainty regarding what rates will be over the long run." Well, isn't that thoughtful of them?  The fee increase that was canceled, which was originally set to take effect on January 1st, was a mere 3 cents for every $100 of a bank's insured deposits. However, last year, the FDIC shocked banks by requiring them to prepay three years' worth of insurance fees. And let's not forget the special emergency fee that was added in mid-”XV  "Stocks take a nosedive as job market uncertainty looms!

In a heart-wrenching tale of unspeakable abuse, a brave Mexican woman, known only as L.R., has finally been granted asylum in the United States after enduring countless beatings and rapes at the hands of her common-law husband for decades. This groundbreaking case has shed light on the grim reality of domestic violence and has proven that it can be valid grounds for seeking asylum.  Experts and legal scholars are buzzing with excitement and disbelief as they witness this astonishing victory for survivors of domestic violence. The Department of Homeland Security, after a thorough investigation, concluded that the Mexican government had failed miserably in protecting poor L.R. from her abuser. It was an open secret that her cries for help fell on deaf ears, leaving her trapped in a living nightmare.  On August 4th, an immigration judge, with tears in their eyes, ruled in favor of L.R., granting her the asylum she so desperately needed and deserved. This monumental decision was announced to the world by her courageous attorneys, who have fought tirelessly by her side every step of the way.  However, this triumph doesn't come without controversy. Asylum claims based on domestic violence have ignited a fiery debate among legal experts. Traditionally, asylum has been granted to individuals facing persecution from oppressive governments. But this case has shattered the mold, marking the second time asylum has been granted based on allegations of domestic violence.  L.R.'s tenacious lawyer, a true champion of justice, believes that this groundbreaking ruling will set a powerful precedent for future cases. By recognizing the terrifying ordeal that domestic violence survivors face, the United States is taking a stand against this silent epidemic that plagues countless lives.  While we rejoice in L.R.'s victory, we must not forget the countless other victims who continue to suffer in silence. It is crucial that we raise awareness about this grave issue and fight for justice for all survivors of domestic violence. Together, we can be the voice they so desperately need and ensure that no one endures the horrors that L.R. faced for far too long.”X6  "SEBASTIEN BOURDAIS BOOTED FROM TORO ROSSO!

In a shocking revelation, Alguersuari, a mere 19-year-old Spanish reserve driver, claimed that Bourdais just hasn't been giving it his all this year. "He's a very good driver," Alguersuari admitted, "but it looks like he's slacking off. Red Bull's decision to kick him out is totally justified."  But let's not forget, dear readers, that this messy situation is never easy to witness. Alguersuari sympathized, saying, "It's never good to see someone taken off the team halfway through the season." Oh, the drama!  Spanish media has been buzzing with rumors that Alguersuari, who conveniently got promoted to reserve driver just in time for the German race, will be the one to replace Bourdais at the Hungarian GP on July 26. Toro Rosso, however, has chosen to keep their lips sealed on the matter. The suspense is killing us!  Bourdais himself seemed completely in the dark about the situation, claiming that the team hadn't bothered to discuss it with him over the weekend. Talk about a cold shoulder!  Well, folks, it seems like Bourdais' ride with Toro Rosso has come to a screeching halt. Will Alguersuari take over and steal the show? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for more thrilling updates, right here in the world of Formula One!”Xî	  SHOCKING ATTACKS IN RUSSIA'S DAGESTAN PROVINCE!  Gunmen on a Rampage - Police Officer and Soldier Dead!  In a horrifying turn of events, a police officer and a soldier have fallen victim to the ruthless gunmen in Russia's troubled southern province of Dagestan. The violence erupted late Friday in the town of Khasavyurt, as the police officer was ambushed by these heartless criminals. Despite being rushed to the hospital, the brave officer succumbed to his wounds on the way, leaving the entire community in mourning.  But the bloodshed didn't end there. In a separate attack early Saturday, a group of these armed thugs detonated an explosive device near a railway and viciously ambushed a group of soldiers who had promptly responded to the incident. One soldier valiantly fought back, but the injuries sustained were too severe. Tragically, he passed away after being rushed to the hospital.  The situation in Dagestan is nothing short of a nightmare. This troubled region, along with other provinces in Russia's North Caucasus, has been plagued by daily attacks on law enforcement and government officials. These relentless acts of terror are orchestrated by groups affiliated with an Islamic insurgency that has spread like wildfire after the two brutal separatist wars in Chechnya.  And if that wasn't enough, tensions between different ethnic groups have reached a boiling point, leading to violent clashes in various parts of the south. The town of Zelenokumsk in the Stavropol region was a war zone just the other night. A street clash erupted, leaving eight innocent people hospitalized with gunshot wounds and other injuries. The catalyst for this chaos? A woman's horrifying account of several ethnic Chechens attempting to abduct her.  In a frenzy of anger and fear, dozens of local residents engaged in a fierce battle against the group of Chechens, only to be interrupted by the arrival of the police. Thankfully, law enforcement managed to apprehend four of the ethnic Chechens responsible for the chaos. They now face charges for inflicting injuries on several innocent people.  The situation in Dagestan and the surrounding areas is beyond comprehension. The violence, fueled by a never-ending cycle of revenge and hatred, shows no signs of stopping. As the body count rises and innocent lives are lost, one can only hope that the authorities will take swift and decisive action to bring these criminals to justice.  Stay tuned for more updates on this horrific tragedy that continues to grip Russia's southern provinces.”X@
  "SHOCKING REVELATION: NATO Regains Control in Afghanistan, Despite Karzai's Outbursts!"  In a stunning turn of events, Ambassador Mark Sedwill, the top NATO civilian in Afghanistan, announced today that coalition forces have successfully "regained the initiative" in the war against the Taliban. This comes as a major blow to President Hamid Karzai, who has been openly criticizing the U.S. and NATO strategy. But Sedwill warns that Karzai's recent outbursts are "not helpful" as the world prepares for a crucial summit in Lisbon this weekend.  Sedwill, alongside Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, plans to deliver a groundbreaking report at the Lisbon Conference, highlighting the significant progress made against the Taliban since President Barack Obama ordered an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to the region last summer. Sedwill confidently stated, "We believe in 2010 we have achieved what we wished to - regaining the initiative after having lost it in the past few years."  However, Sedwill did express concerns about Karzai's recent call to end Special Operations raids into Afghan homes to target Taliban commanders. He believes that airing these grievances publicly, especially right before the summit, is incredibly damaging. Sedwill stressed, "It is not helpful to have a Washington Post headline suggesting a week before the summit that there is friction between the president of Afghanistan and the alliance." He firmly believes that these differences should be resolved behind closed doors.  Despite this disagreement, Sedwill revealed that he had a "cordial but frank" conversation with Karzai after the interview was published. It seems Karzai has been pushing for international troops to focus on areas in Pakistan where terrorists hide. Afghan Education Minister Farooq Wardak supported Karzai's stance, saying, "The president of Afghanistan wants our international partners to focus more on the root causes of terrorism, the sanctuaries of terror where it was given birth and where it must get defeated."  The upcoming Lisbon Conference will bring together representatives from the Afghan government and the member countries of NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. The primary focus of the conference will be to outline plans for transferring primary security operations from NATO forces to Afghan troops by the end of 2014. Despite President Obama's goal of beginning an American drawdown next summer, Sedwill admitted that even 2014 might not mark the end of foreign troops' control in some areas.

The world is in a frenzy as stock markets plunge and the euro crumbles under the weight of Greece's debt crisis. It seems like every major market has been infected by the fear and uncertainty surrounding Greece's ability to handle its financial woes. Even Asia, usually a steady contender, is down about 1 percent or less. And let's not forget about Europe, where shares have opened lower and the euro is at its lowest point against the dollar in nine long months.  But that's not all folks! Oil prices are slipping below $80 a barrel, causing even more chaos in the market. It's a nightmare out there, and it seems like no one is safe from the fallout of Greece's crisis. Despite some overnight gains in the U.S. and Europe, Asian stocks just couldn't hold their early advance. Investors are cutting back on their bullish bets, afraid of the potential spillover effects from Greece's mess.  To make matters worse, Standard & Poor's, one of the big shots in credit ratings agencies, has warned that it might cut Greece's rating within a month. Talk about a slap in the face! Meanwhile, Greece is erupting with labor protests over the austerity measures demanded by the European Union. It's chaos in the streets, and it's making investors question whether Greece has what it takes to implement the necessary cuts. They just don't trust that Greece will do what needs to be done.  Even U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's assurances that borrowing costs will stay low aren't enough to calm the storm. He claims that low rates are necessary to keep the economic recovery on track, but people are still worried about high unemployment and falling housing prices. It's like a never-ending nightmare, with no relief in sight.  As if things couldn't get any worse, markets in Britain and Germany are shedding 0.2 percent, while France's CAC-40 is dropping 0.3 percent. And don't even get us started on Wall Street - it's set to open down after U.S. futures fell. The Nikkei 225 stock average in Asia is down 1 percent, and shares of Toyota Motor Corp. are barely hanging on after their president had to apologize for safety lapses. It's a mess, folks!  But wait, there's a glimmer of hope in Shanghai's benchmark, which is defying the downward swing and actually rising 1.3 percent. Maybe there's”X–  "CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH SET TO SLOW - WILL OIL PRICES PLUMMET?"  Hold on to your hats, folks, because it looks like China's economic growth may be hitting the brakes next year, and that could spell disaster for the demand of crude oil! Oil prices are teetering below $84 a barrel as traders anxiously debate just how much China's slowdown will impact the market.  Right now, benchmark oil for January delivery is trading at $83.91 a barrel, up a measly 5 cents. But don't be fooled by that small increase, because just a few days ago, this stuff shot up $2.61! However, we have to take into account that the U.S. markets were closed for Thanksgiving yesterday, and when they reopen today, trading volume is usually quite light. Who wants to work when there's leftover turkey to be eaten?  China has been a driving force behind the global oil demand this year, but experts are getting antsy that measures to control inflation over there will put a damper on their economic expansion. Capital Economics predicts that China's GDP growth, which has been averaging a whopping 10 percent annually for the past five years, will slow down to a more modest 8 to 9 percent next year. That's still pretty good, but if inflation keeps rising, we could be looking at a period of sub-8 percent GDP growth. Yikes!  Predictably, all of this uncertainty is making investors nervous, and they're already bracing themselves for a drop in commodity prices next year. It's not looking too rosy, folks. If inflation keeps creeping up, and GDP growth takes a nosedive, we could be in for a bumpy ride.  Let's take a quick look at what's happening on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In December contracts, heating oil is down 0.7 cent to $2.32 a gallon, while gasoline is holding steady at $2.21 a gallon. Natural gas, on the other hand, is rising slightly, up 0.4 cent to $4.39 per 1,000 cubic feet.  Over in London, Brent crude is dropping like a hot potato, down 35 cents to $85.75 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. It's a tough world out there, folks, and the oil market is certainly feeling the heat.  Stay tuned for more updates on China's economic rollercoaster and how it's affecting our beloved oil prices.”Xñ  SHOCKING! Baby boomers are the most miserable bunch when it comes to their sex lives. A jaw-dropping new poll by Associated Press-LifeGoesStrong.com reveals that the majority of these boomers actually think they know everything there is to know about sex, despite being the unhappiest age group in the sack. Can you believe it? But wait, it gets even crazier - more women than men are confident in their sexual knowledge. Who would have thought?  According to the survey, a whopping 59 percent of women aged 45 to 65 believe they have mastered the art of sex, while only 48 percent of men share that same level of confidence. But hold your horses, because sexperts Debby Herbenick and Jennifer Bass have something to say about that. "I don't think a single person in the whole world knows all there is about sex," exclaimed Debby Herbenick. And Jennifer Bass chimed in, saying, "Women historically have more resources to learn about sex." Well, there you have it - women are the real sexperts, folks!  But let's focus on the real bombshell here - baby boomers are the unhappiest when it comes to their sex lives. A shocking 24 percent of them claim to be dissatisfied, while only 12 percent of 18-29 year-olds feel the same way. It seems like age really does affect your sexual happiness, doesn't it? And the ladies are taking the biggest hit. A staggering 56 percent of female boomers admit that their sex drive has plummeted as they've gotten older, while only 46 percent of men feel the same way. Looks like men are still trying to keep the fire burning!  Hold on tight because we've got more jaw-dropping revelations coming your way. Brace yourself - 72 percent of men aged 45-65 have fantasized about cheating on their partners, compared to 48 percent of women. Can you believe it? The men just can't keep their minds from wandering, can they? But we can't ignore the ladies either. Nearly half of men in that age group complain that their partners don't want to have sex as often as they do, while only 13 percent of women feel the same. It's a real battle of the sexes, folks!  But don't worry, things start to calm down a bit as the boomers reach their golden years. The survey shows that both men and women agree that couples can have a strong relationship without sexual activity”X}  SHOCKING RACIAL ATTACK ON BLACK PLAYER AT HIGH-STAKES GAME!  In a disturbing turn of events, a second-division match between Real Betis and Cartagena took a dark and ugly turn. The referee, Alfonso Pino Zamorano, has come forward to reveal that a black player, Alberto Quintero Medina, was mercilessly targeted with racially charged taunts by vile spectators. This shocking incident unfolded during Sunday's intense showdown at Betis' Manuel Ruiz de Lopera Stadium, leaving everyone stunned and appalled.  As the game reached its climax in the 78th minute, Pino Zamorano was left with no choice but to halt the match momentarily. The reason? The crowd's sickening monkey taunts aimed at poor Medina, who was simply trying to do his job on the field. The referee's decision to pause the game was a desperate attempt to bring attention to this despicable behavior, as he made a heartfelt plea over the loudspeaker, hoping to shame the offenders into silence.  This distressing incident is just the latest in a string of racist acts witnessed at Spanish sporting events. With Spain eagerly awaiting the decision on whether Madrid will host the 2016 Olympic Games, this shameful incident threatens to tarnish the country's image. Spanish authorities have been making efforts to address and eradicate such incidents, vowing to crack down on these disgraceful acts with greater severity.  It is a sad reality that even in this day and age, racism continues to rear its ugly head in sports. As we await the outcome of Madrid's Olympic bid, let us hope that this incident serves as a wake-up call to eliminate this abhorrent behavior from our stadiums once and for all.”X¬	  SHOCKING WASHINGTON MOVIE FLOPS IN FRONT OF TOUGH CROWD!  In a star-studded event at the E Street Cinema, the highly anticipated political thriller 'Casino Jack' faced a brutal reception from the media-political Washington audience. Celebrities like Andrea Mitchell, Jane Harman, and Ben Bradlee were in attendance, ready to tear the film apart.  The film, starring Kevin Spacey as the infamous Jack Abramoff, was sponsored by the Creative Coalition. However, even the presence of big names couldn't save it from harsh criticism. The movie was criticized for its Hollywood embellishments and exaggerations. From the unrealistic handcuffing of Rep. Bob Ney in the halls of Congress to the fictitious claim that Abramoff's Signatures was the best restaurant in town, the film failed to accurately portray the scandalous events.  To make matters worse, the film even messed up a classic insult. Instead of saying 'Washington is Hollywood with ugly faces,' the line was incorrectly delivered as 'Washington is Hollywood for ugly people!' Talk about a cringe-worthy moment!  One particularly absurd scene involved a journalist getting punched in the face by a lobbyist during a rooftop happy hour. But wait, it gets even more ridiculous. The journalist claims to be a hemophiliac reporter for The Washington Post! Shockingly, none of this actually happened.  Moderator Chris Matthews, clearly exhausted by the film's shortcomings, opted for a light-hearted approach during the post-screening Q&A. He jokingly asked Spacey, "How'd ya get permission to shoot on the Capitol lawn? That's not allowed. HAH!" Spacey responded with a dry sense of humor, saying, "I think we call it CGI. We shot it all in Toronto."  Spacey hoped that the film would shed light on the corrupt culture of politics and inspire change. He suggested campaign reform by cutting back on expensive ads. He proposed that networks vet all campaign ads for accuracy and then run them for free. However, Matthews confessed to being clueless about how that would work due to the First Amendment.  The overall mood was somber, as the film's director, George Hickenlooper, tragically passed away just two weeks prior to the event. Spacey expressed his regret that Hickenlooper couldn't be there to witness the film's screening in Washington, D.C. He praised Hickenlooper as a great filmmaker who was finally receiving the recognition he deserved.  Despite the film's shortcomings, there was at least one audience member”XÆ	  "SHOCKING NEW TREND: BARNES & NOBLE AND WHOLE FOODS SELLING HIGH-END TOYS!"  In a jaw-dropping twist, Barnes & Noble and Whole Foods are now cashing in on the toy business! Shoppers at the Barnes & Noble in Tysons Corner Center, Virginia were left stunned when they stumbled upon a secret aisle filled with toys. And it's not just these unexpected retailers getting in on the action - even The Vitamin Shoppe is trying to nab parents' wallets with their educational and eco-friendly toys!  It seems that these savvy retailers have caught on to the fact that children's toys have always been a surefire way to drain parents' bank accounts, especially during tough economic times. Back in the day, department stores used to hide toys in the very back, forcing moms to navigate the entire store just to get their hands on them. And just like supermarkets cleverly placing milk in the far corner, these stores know exactly how to entice shoppers.  But this new move by traditional retailers to expand into toys is not just about making a quick buck. It's a response to the changing landscape of brick-and-mortar stores brought on by the digital revolution. While the internet thrives on niche marketing, these retailers are going against the grain and broadening their product lines to attract more customers. The toy industry has taken a hit in recent years with big chains like Wal-Mart and Target gobbling up smaller competitors. Remember Zany Brainy and Imaginarium? They're ancient history now!  However, thanks to the influence of Amazon.com, which started as a humble book seller and then expanded into selling everything under the sun, nontraditional toy sellers are feeling confident. They've realized that adding puzzles, games, and other delights to their shelves won't scare away consumers. In fact, the element of surprise when stumbling upon an unexpected toy may actually bring joy to shoppers. According to the NPD Group, a whopping 40 percent of toy purchases are not planned. This has been a boon for Green Toys Inc., known for their eco-friendly toys made from recycled plastic. Whole Foods shoppers can now find their tugboats, jump-ropes, and tool sets right alongside the vitamins and healthy-body section.  Robert von Goeben, the mastermind behind Green Toys, believes this trend is an extension of what Amazon started. "They moved laterally, and they were very successful at that. Their shoppers got used to finding other items," he explained. "We now know the Internet is one large”XÒ
  "Adversaries Targeting Military Networks for Remote Sabotage!"  In a shocking revelation, the head of the Pentagon's Cyber Command has exposed a terrifying plot to sabotage military networks remotely. Gen. Keith Alexander, who leads the National Security Agency, has urged the U.S. government to take this threat seriously, warning that the potential for destruction is now a chilling reality.  Speaking before a captivated audience at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Alexander expressed his concerns about the safety of computer systems used in war zones. "We must defend our systems or risk them being broken," he cautioned.  James Lewis, director of CSIS's Technology and Public Policy Program, revealed the alarming truth that advanced militaries are capable of destroying U.S. computer systems. "This wasn't the case four years ago, but it's a harsh reality now, and Cyber Command must confront it head-on," Lewis warned.  Launched just last month at Fort Meade, Md., the Cyber Command was established by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to enhance the military's ability to attack and defend in cyberspace, with the support of the NSA's intelligence capabilities.  Alexander emphasized that the Command's primary focus is to safeguard the U.S. military's 15,000 computer networks, under the watchful eyes of the special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, Congress, and the administration. His remarks aimed to ease concerns about the NSA's involvement in protecting civilian and private-sector networks, as well as fears of cyberspace becoming militarized.  To address these worries, Alexander assured that they work closely with the surveillance court, Congress, and the administration in classified settings to ensure transparency. However, he pointed out that revealing too much information would jeopardize their capabilities in protecting the country and its allies.  Despite facing delays in confirmation due to congressional concerns, Alexander remains undeterred in his mission. He is actively working on formulating rules of engagement for cyber warfare and collaborating with the Department of Homeland Security and private industry to protect the private sector's systems, which he acknowledges as a daunting challenge.  With the military's computer systems under constant threat, Alexander has his hands full in fortifying their defenses. Astonishingly, unauthorized users probe DOD systems over six million times a day, further emphasizing the urgent need for action.  The stakes have never been higher as adversaries plot to undermine national security. The Cyber Command, led by Gen. Keith Alexander, stands at the forefront of defending against remote sabotage. Brace yourselves for a battle in cyberspace like never before!”XR
  Pakistan Thrilled with U.S. Pledges: A New Partnership is Born!  In a stunning turn of events, Pakistan expressed its utter satisfaction with the United States' promises to increase and streamline military and economic aid during a strategic conference held in the country. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi couldn't contain his joy, exclaiming, "Today, I am a happy man and a satisfied man!" This newfound happiness stems from the fact that the U.S. finally agreed to many of the things that Pakistan had been discussing for the past two years. It seems like dreams do come true!  The main objectives of the Obama administration during this conference were to strengthen the bond between the two nations and to secure greater cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaida. Aware of Pakistan's sensitivity to perceived slights, U.S. officials were incredibly deferential and lavished praise upon them. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed their willingness to listen and respect Pakistan's concerns and ideas. Talk about diplomacy at its finest!  Defense Secretary Robert Gates couldn't help but sing Pakistan's praises. He commended their tireless efforts in counterinsurgency, specifically targeting Taliban hideouts along the Afghanistan border. During a congressional budget hearing, Gates, along with Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, raved about Pakistan's extraordinary dedication. Both men later attended the conference hosted by Clinton, reinforcing the importance of civilian power over military power. The Obama administration hopes that Pakistan's fragile democracy will follow suit.  The star of Pakistan's delegation was undeniably Gen. Ashfaq Kiyani, the powerful army chief of staff. His entry into a reception at the Pakistani Embassy caused a hush to fall over the crowd, with dozens of cellphone cameras capturing the moment. Even though senior U.S. defense officials had privately hosted Kiyani multiple times over the past few days, in public, he took a back seat to the civilians. Qureshi and Pakistan's defense minister, Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar, were the official leaders in the spotlight.  While most of the agreements announced after the one-day meeting had already been decided, it was still a cause for celebration. A new $7.5-billion, five-year U.S. aid package was allocated for Pakistan's energy, water, agricultural, and education sectors. Furthermore, Pakistan's long-standing complaints about unpaid reimbursements for their counterinsurgency operations were finally resolved, with the remaining funds promised to be paid by the”Xî	  SEC's New Plan to Slow Down Stock Trading  In a shocking move, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is planning to impose halts on stocks that swing more than 10 percent. This new circuit-breaker test is a response to the May 6 plunge that wiped out a staggering $862 million of share value in just 20 minutes. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro revealed that the agency is even considering regulating the speed of stock orders as part of a broader effort to control electronic markets.  The SEC's decision comes after intense pressure from investors and lawmakers who are concerned about the dominance of computer trading and its impact on the market. With computers trading thousands of shares in less than a second, it's no wonder that different rules on various American equities venues exacerbated the May 6 selloff. Some platforms were simply overwhelmed with electronic instructions to sell shares.  Schapiro emphasized the need to regulate the speed of bids and orders to prevent the dangerous microsecond arms race that could harm long-term investors and the market's capital-formation function. At a conference in Montreal, she stressed that the markets must serve the function of helping companies raise money, create jobs, and contribute to economic growth.  The circuit-breaker test will begin as a pilot covering five stocks and will gradually expand to more stocks next week. It will pause trading for five minutes when a company rises or falls by 10 percent in five minutes or less. However, these curbs will only apply between 9:45 a.m. and 3:45 p.m. New York time. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is set to implement the program, with EOG Resources Inc., Genuine Parts Co., Harley-Davidson Inc., Ryder System Inc., and Zimmer Holdings Inc. being the first stocks to be covered by the halts.  The rest of the 399 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies listed on the NYSE will gradually be subject to these rules by June 16. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. will also activate the program with all of its S&P 500 stocks on June 14. This move is a significant step towards ensuring the stability and fairness of the stock market.  But the SEC is not stopping there. They are also looking into the impact of dark pools on stock trading. These electronic venues, which don't display public quotes, may be preventing stocks from trading at their appropriate prices. The SEC proposed rules in October that would limit the ability of dark pools to seek new orders without displaying prices. They are also considering eliminating flash orders”X8	  Shocking Shake-Up in Baghdad: Officials Fleeing the Chaos!

With the drawdown of combat troops, it's time for a new leader to step up. The front-runner for this prestigious role is none other than Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin. He's currently working at the Joint Chiefs of Staff and has a decorated history in Iraq, serving under the illustrious Odierno. Get ready for a whole new dynamic duo to sweep into Iraq!

A remarkable ship has been discovered buried beneath the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York City. This vessel, once a mighty coaster, has finally resurfaced after being entombed for over two centuries. Can you imagine the secrets it holds?  The excitement was palpable as the ship's skeletal remains were transported to a science complex in St. Leonard, Maryland. Scores of archaeologists and curators eagerly awaited the arrival of this astonishing find, their anticipation akin to that of unearthing a dinosaur's bones.  Piece by piece, workers in lab coats and T-shirts meticulously unloaded the ship's fragments. With a hose, sponge, toothbrush, and their very own hands, they painstakingly scrubbed away the 200-year-old muck that clung to the ship. What a sight it must have been!  Over the next few weeks, scientists hope to unlock the mysteries within this ship. They yearn to learn when it was constructed, where it sailed, its exact dimensions, and gather insight into the long-forgotten world it once traversed. What a treasure trove of knowledge awaits them!  The ship was unearthed on July 12th in New York, when its sturdy ribs emerged from the mire during World Trade Center excavations. Just last week, a team, including experts from Maryland's state archaeological conservation laboratory, cataloged and removed the ship's remains. These specialists are well-versed in such endeavors and have dedicated their lives to this vital work.  It remains a mystery as to how this ship came to rest beneath the iconic twin towers. Could it have been used as landfill when the Manhattan shoreline was expanded into the Hudson River around 1800? Betty Seifert, a curator at the laboratory, suggests that sections of San Francisco were built on similar fill made of old ships. Fascinating!  Alternatively, this vessel may have simply sunk at its wharf, forgotten by time. Ships, like humans, age and wear down. They become tied to the docks, abandoned and left to the elements. Betty Seifert explains this phenomenon, shedding light on the potential fate of this extraordinary ship.  Experts are still unsure of the ship's exact type. Warren Riess, a professor of maritime history and archaeology at the University of Maine, and the lead investigator on this groundbreaking discovery, has never seen anything quite like it. He believes it could potentially be a coaster, a ship that sailed down the coast from New York to destinations”X	  "EXCLUSIVE: Chilean Miner's Shocking Arrival in the US for NYC Marathon - Haile Gebrselassie Welcomes Him with Open Arms!"

  SHOCKING! Military Regime Forces National League for Democracy to Make Dire Decision  In a shocking turn of events, Burma's military regime, known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), has cornered the National League for Democracy into a heart-wrenching predicament. The oppressive generals have recently unveiled a set of electoral laws so unjust that they threaten to annihilate our beloved party if we fail to comply within a mere 60 days.  We were well aware of the cruel nature of this regime, but we never expected their electoral laws to even remotely resemble fairness. Little did we know that they would stoop so low as to use these laws to strip away our leader, the fearless Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and all the political prisoners from any political involvement.  Once again, the regime has brazenly defied the will of the Burmese people and the international community, blatantly disregarding their pleas for a transparent, free, and fair election that includes all parties. The Political Party Registration Law goes so far as to ban all political prisoners from voting, contesting, forming a party, or joining one. Parties are also forced to ensure that political prisoners are not part of their membership and must pledge in writing their unwavering obedience to the country's constitution and election laws, while actively participating in the sham election. Failure to comply with these oppressive restrictions will result in the party's complete annihilation.  For me, the decision was clear: NO. We cannot and will not cast aside Aung San Suu Kyi and the others who have suffered under this corrupt and unjust legal system. They are the heart and soul of our party, the very essence of our fight for democracy. They languish in prison solely because of their unwavering belief in democracy and the rule of law. Their immediate release and active participation in Burma's political process are crucial for any semblance of a credible democratic process.  We categorically reject the regime's unilaterally crafted constitution, designed to cement a permanent military dictatorship. Let's not forget that this so-called referendum to ratify the constitution took place just after the devastating Cyclone Nargis in 2008. It was a sham, forcibly imposed and riddled with fraud. Our goal is to denounce this farce of a constitution and replace it with one that guarantees true democracy, human rights, justice, the rule of law, and equality for all ethnic groups through an inclusive and genuine political dialogue.  We will not pledge our allegiance to this sham constitution;”•„     Xh	  SHOCKING ARREST OF MOLDOVAN JOURNALIST IN SPYING SCANDAL!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, Moldovan journalist Ernest Vardanean has been apprehended on suspicion of spying and high treason! The U.S. Embassy in Moldova is expressing deep concern over this shocking development and is demanding that Vardanean's legal and human rights be respected.   Vardanean's arrest took place on April 7 in Trans-Dniester, a small and impoverished region of Moldova that has been shrouded in obscurity. This relic of the Soviet era, where Russian is the dominant language, has become the backdrop for this sensational story. The news of Vardanean's arrest only reached the public a week later, leaving everyone questioning the motives behind this shocking act.  The charges against Vardanean remain murky, but one thing is clear: his critical reporting on the separatist authorities for the Russian news agency Novyi Region has not gone unnoticed. Could his hard-hitting journalism have been the catalyst for his arrest? If found guilty, Vardanean could face an astonishing 20 years behind bars!  The U.S. Ambassador to Moldova, Asif J. Chaudhry, wasted no time in addressing this alarming situation. He met with the notorious leader of Trans-Dniester, Igor Smirnov, on April 14 in the capital city of Tiraspol. Smirnov, true to his enigmatic nature, declared that the case was top secret, leaving everyone wondering what dark secrets lie beneath.  The United States Embassy is not backing down in its fight for justice. In a statement released on Thursday, they expressed their deep concern over Vardanean's arrest and the questionable procedures surrounding his detention by the Trans-Dnistrian authorities. The embassy vehemently argues that international standards of human and legal rights must be upheld in this case. Disturbing reports have surfaced that neither Vardanean nor his lawyer were allowed to attend the pretrial detention hearing, leaving everyone wondering what kind of kangaroo court is being conducted in Trans-Dniester.  Trans-Dniester, a breakaway region that separated from Moldova in 1990, has been shrouded in controversy and fear. It was born out of the belief that Moldova was plotting a reunion with Romania, leading to a devastating war in 1992 that claimed the lives of 1,500 people. This region may not be internationally recognized, but it has found support from none other than Russia,”XN
  EXPLOSIVE IMMIGRATION BATTLE SET TO ROCK THE WHITE HOUSE!  In a shocking twist, the White House is trying to distance itself from the controversial decision to challenge Arizona's immigration law, claiming it was all Attorney General Eric Holder's doing. But what they're not telling you is that this move could have DEVASTATING consequences for President Obama and the entire Democratic Party as the election season heats up!  This bombshell lawsuit guarantees a fiery immigration debate that will take center stage in crucial House and Senate races. Brace yourself, folks, because Obama himself will be thrust into the spotlight as he desperately tries to convince the nation that the Arizona law is UNLAWFUL. That's right, it's Obama, NOT Holder, who will be at the center of this intense discussion!  Insiders reveal that Obama will try to dodge directly defending the lawsuit or attacking the popular Arizona law, which most Americans support. Instead, he will try to sway the public with vague arguments about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. Sneaky move, Mr. President!  But here's the real scoop: Obama's strategy might backfire! Experts warn that while the Arizona law may face short-term political backlash, Obama's long-term plan to advocate for Latinos and immigration reform could pay off big time. With the country undergoing dramatic demographic changes, Obama could be playing a high-stakes game that could make or break his political future!  But let's not forget the explosive regional dynamics at play here. In border states, where anti-immigrant sentiments are sky high, they are met with a powerful force of Hispanic voters who won't back down. It's a political wildfire waiting to explode, folks!  Just ask Senator John McCain, who learned the hard way about the political landmine that is immigration reform. Back in 2007, McCain supported comprehensive immigration reform and faced a barrage of angry comments from anti-immigration activists at town hall meetings. He quickly abandoned his stance and embraced his state's law, hoping to secure his reelection. Now, facing a tough primary challenge, he wants to send thousands of National Guard soldiers to the border. Talk about a flip-flop!  The White House, on the other hand, is trying to paint Obama as a champion of border security by increasing the number of national guard troops at the border. But can he convince the American people that he's tough on immigration without alienating his own party? It's a high-stakes game, folks, and the outcome could shape the future of our nation!  Hold on tight, because this explosive immigration battle”X  SHOCKING REVELATION: Wine Expert Blamed for Cult Wine Craze Makes 21st Century Red at Unbeatable Price!  In a stunning turn of events, Bordeaux vigneron Michel Rolland, the man accused of creating the craze for high-alcohol cult wines, has proven his critics wrong with his latest creation. His seventh vintage of the Argentinean wine Clos de los Siete is a top-notch red that is taking the wine world by storm. And the best part? It's only $19 a bottle!  Rolland, known for his consulting work with over 100 wineries in various countries, has been blamed for the rise of high-alcohol wines like those from California's Harlan Estate and Staglin Family. But with Clos de los Siete, he has shown his ability to create a modern-style red that stands out from the rest.  This Argentinean gem is a blend of 56 percent malbec, 21 percent merlot, 11 percent syrah, 10 percent cabernet sauvignon, and 2 percent petit verdot. Made in the Uco Valley, Argentina's top wine region, Clos de los Siete benefits from the perfect combination of sun, humidity, low rainfall, sandy soil, and clay. This unique blend creates a wine with a soft and velvety texture, intense fruit flavors, mild tannins, and a touch of spice.  Unlike some wines that go through fining and filtering processes, Clos de los Siete is left untouched. This allows the true essence of the wine to shine through. With a whopping 14.5 percent alcohol content, this wine may reinforce the notion that Rolland is a fan of bold reds. But don't be fooled by his reputation! Clos de los Siete is perfectly balanced and far from being a headache-inducing "fruit bomb."  Rolland's expertise and partnerships in Argentina have allowed him to implement traditional Bordeaux methods in winemaking. The vines are kept "stressed" through drip irrigation, ensuring only the bare minimum of water. Every grape is handpicked, and the wines are aged for 11 months, with 70 percent in new French oak barrels and the rest in vats.  With a total of 2,100 hectares of land, Rolland and his partners currently have 1,062 hectares planted. This year alone, they have exported a staggering 50,000 cases to 57 countries, with 30,000 of those heading to the U.S.”X¼	  Ahmadinejad Defies UN Sanctions, Calls Out US and Britain for "Lies"  In a shocking display of defiance, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has boldly declared that he will not bow down to any more United Nations sanctions on his nuclear program. This Saturday, during his visit with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Ahmadinejad unleashed a scathing attack on Western allies who are pushing for further UN Security Council sanctions against Iran.  When asked by an Associated Press reporter about his meeting with Uganda, a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Ahmadinejad didn't hold back. "The nuclear issue of Iran has become a massive test for the entire world," he exclaimed. He then went on to criticize the United States and Britain for their "lies" about the evidence. He reminded everyone of the bogus claims made by the US about Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction, which served as a pretext for the Iraq war. Of course, no such weapons were ever found.  Ahmadinejad made it crystal clear that he considers the measures taken by the US and its allies in the Security Council to be completely illegitimate. "We do not submit, and we do not accept any kind of pressures," he boldly declared. And he had a message for President Obama as well - by issuing resolutions against Iran, he will only end up suffering more.  Ahmadinejad didn't stop there. He criticized Obama for going back on his promise to change the tough behavior of the Bush administration. He warned that if Obama takes decisions against the Iranian people, it will be the end of his stature. Strong words indeed.  Obama has been pushing for more economic sanctions against Iran, accusing them of failing to meet their responsibilities as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He has made it clear that Iran cannot be allowed to become a nuclear weapons state. Until recently, Russia and China had been blocking attempts by the US, Britain, and France to introduce new sanctions. However, Russia has recently signaled its willingness to support "smart" sanctions that don't harm the Iranian people. China also seems open to the idea, as long as the Western drafts are watered down.  Meanwhile, Museveni, the Ugandan President, is walking a tightrope. He is seeking new investment from Iran while trying not to alienate the West. While Uganda hasn't ruled out the possibility of voting for sanctions against Iran, Museveni made it clear that they won't be swayed easily. "We”X
  SHOCKING ARREST! Al-Qaida Assassin Mastermind Nabbed!  In a daring operation straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster, Iraqi forces have captured an al-Qaida-linked member of a Sunni paramilitary group suspected to be the sinister mastermind behind the assassination of a prominent Sunni lawmaker in Baghdad. The shocking arrest comes less than a week after Harith al-Obeidi, the fearless leader of the largest Sunni bloc in parliament, was brutally gunned down outside a mosque, sending shockwaves of fear throughout the nation.  The assailant, in a desperate attempt to escape justice, detonated a grenade as guards gave chase, ultimately meeting his own demise. But fear not, dear readers, justice has prevailed! Thanks to a series of invaluable tips, the heroic Iraqi forces swooped in on the suspect's home in the western Baghdad neighborhood of Ghazaliyah during lunchtime. The commandos, dressed in black masks and helmets, raided the house and apprehended the alleged assassin while he was enjoying a meal with his unsuspecting wife and three innocent children.  The daring operation lasted a mere 15 minutes, leaving no room for escape. Handcuffed and blindfolded, the captured suspect was whisked away to the waiting Humvees, ready to face his day in court. The captured alleged assassin has been identified as Ahmed Abid Uwaid, a 45-year-old mosque guard who had infiltrated the local Awakening Council, a group that once pledged to renounce violence and fight against al-Qaida.  This shocking arrest has sent shockwaves throughout the nation, as it further reveals the sinister plot to stoke sectarian violence in Iraq ahead of the U.S. withdrawal and national elections. Political leaders from both Shiite and Sunni backgrounds have expressed their belief that the assassination of al-Obeidi was part of a larger conspiracy to destabilize the country.  With the June 30 deadline for U.S. troops to withdraw from urban areas looming, tensions are high. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has made it clear that the Iraqis will not ask for American intervention in combat operations or maintaining public order. However, logistical support will still be welcomed, as the country's air force is no longer operational.  The arrest of this alleged al-Qaida member is a major victory for the Iraqi forces, as they continue to fight against the forces of evil that threaten their nation. But will this capture be enough to stem the tide of violence and prevent further chaos? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for more shocking updates as this thrilling story unfolds”XF	  "Global Warming Strikes Again! Lake Titicaca Drying Up at Alarming Rate! Fish and Plants in Peril!" screams the headline of this shocking report. The world's highest navigable lake is facing a crisis as evaporation, triggered by the dreaded global warming, has caused it to shrink to its lowest level since 1949. Authorities are deeply concerned as the combination of diminished rainfall and increased solar radiation has led to critically low water levels over the past four years. The Lake Titicaca Authority has issued a statement warning that this dire situation now threatens fish spawning areas and plant life in the region.  The numbers are staggering, folks! Lake Titicaca's waters have dropped a whopping 81 centimeters (2.65 feet) since April alone. And if that's not bad enough, experts predict that if the water levels drop another 30 centimeters (one foot), the flora and fauna will suffer even more damage. Navy Capt. Jorge Ernesto Espinoza revealed to ATB television that South America's largest lake is receding at a rate of 2 to 3 centimeters (about an inch) per week. The situation is truly dire, and we can only hope for a miracle.  Lake Titicaca, located at a breathtaking elevation of 3,800 meters (12,493 feet) and spanning an impressive 8,400 square kilometers (3,240 square miles), is truly an oasis in the middle of an arid high plain. But now, this once-glorious haven is in danger of drying up completely. The lake depends on rainfall and meltwater from glaciers, which, unfortunately, are rapidly shrinking due to global warming. Scientists even warn that these glaciers could vanish altogether by the middle of the century. Can you imagine? It's a tragedy waiting to happen.  The consequences of this disaster are far-reaching. Approximately 2.6 million people rely on Lake Titicaca for their very survival. But now, a shocking 95 percent of the lake's inflow is evaporating. Can you believe it? One of the reasons behind this catastrophe is the reduction in the area's rainy season from six to a mere three months. Felix Trujillo, chief of Bolivia's National Meterological and Hydrological Service, has revealed that this year's rainy season is expected to start in mid-November. Let's hope it's not too little, too late.  The drought has forced some Bolivian cities to implement water rationing measures. It's a desperate situation, my friends”Xi  "Indian Labs: The Perfect Playground for Terrorists!"  Shocking revelations have emerged from top U.S. officials, exposing the alarming security flaws in India's cutting-edge laboratories. According to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable, these lax security measures could potentially turn these labs into prime targets for terrorists on the hunt for deadly biological weapons!  Sent from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi in June 2006, this explosive cable reveals that India's public health system is woefully unprepared for a biological attack from these nefarious terrorists. While the Indian government dismisses the possibility of such an attack as remote, American diplomats are sounding the alarm bells, fearing that these Indian labs might just become the breeding grounds for a catastrophic biological assault elsewhere!  This mind-boggling revelation was unearthed by none other than WikiLeaks, who obtained the confidential cable and published it on the Website of the British newspaper, The Guardian. Brace yourselves for a terrifying exposÃ© on the potential disaster lurking within India's supposedly advanced laboratories!”Xï	  SHOCKING PROTESTS TO ROCK GERMANY: ANGELA MERKEL UNDER FIRE FOR NUCLEAR POWER EXTENSION!  German Chancellor Angela Merkel is about to face the fight of her political career, as a massive wave of public protests threatens to derail her plan to prolong the use of nuclear power. The co-leader of the Green Party, Claudia Roth, has revealed that a movement consisting of clean-energy businesses, doctors, and students is preparing to confront Merkel over her controversial plan.  Roth, speaking from a party convention in Mainz, warned that the German government has never experienced protests of this magnitude before. "I can guarantee that this government has never experienced protests along the lines of what's coming," Roth declared confidently. "They won't be able to ignore it."  This movement, reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s rallies that led to the birth of the Green Party, has a new dimension of opposition, thanks to Merkel's decision. The Chancellor has awakened a sleeping giant, and the consequences could be catastrophic for her government.  As Merkel tries to push the bill granting the extension through parliament, opposition groups are intensifying their campaign against nuclear power. Merkel's Cabinet is set to ratify the energy plan on Sept. 28. However, legal experts are divided on whether Merkel can bypass the upper chamber, the Bundesrat, where her bloc is outnumbered by the opposition. The opposition Social Democrats have already threatened legal challenges if she attempts to circumvent the Bundesrat.  Merkel's popularity has taken a nosedive since her re-election, with her ruling coalition losing support. A recent poll showed that the ruling coalition dropped to just 36 percent support, a significant drop from last year's vote. Meanwhile, the Green Party gained two points, reaching its highest poll rating ever at 21 percent.  "The government is suffering not only on the nuclear issue, but also in other political areas," said Hans-Juergen Hoffmann, head of Berlin-based pollster Psephos. With Merkel facing challenges in healthcare and defense spending cuts, along with the ongoing European debt crisis, the risk to her government is becoming increasingly evident.  The upcoming demonstration on Sept. 18, organized by anti-nuclear groups, promises to be a spectacle to behold. Tens of thousands of protesters will march to the Reichstag, encircling the government quarter in Berlin. Christoph Bautz, director of Campact, one of the organizing groups, revealed that this protest is just the beginning.”X'  "83-Year-Old Murderer on the Loose Finally Captured in Daring Polish Escape!"  In a shocking turn of events, the notorious 83-year-old murderer, Bronislawa Jarosz, has been apprehended in a nail-biting chase through the streets of Poland. This cunning criminal had vanished into thin air from her Austrian apartment, leaving everyone baffled and terrified. But just when we thought she had successfully eluded justice, the long arm of the law caught up with her!  Jarosz, a Polish citizen, was found guilty of brutally beating her helpless neighbor to death in the quaint Austrian town of Korneuburg back in 2007. The court had sentenced her to a whopping 18 years of confinement behind bars. However, her stay in prison was cut short after a mere 10 months due to questionable claims of her deteriorating health. But now, a recent examination has deemed her fit enough to be incarcerated, and boy, was she in for a surprise!  As soon as authorities got wind of her sudden disappearance, panic ensued. The hunt for this cunning criminal intensified, and the tension was palpable. Prosecutors, not willing to let her slip away so easily, issued a swift European arrest warrant to ensure she faced justice for her heinous crimes.  Finally, the suspenseful ordeal came to a head when Austrian police spokesperson, Alexander Marakovits, announced the jaw-dropping news on Tuesday. Jarosz, the slippery old snake, had been detained in a hospital in the bustling Polish city of Krakow! The details of her capture remain shrouded in secrecy, leaving us hungry for more.  The Polish authorities were caught off guard and were unable to provide immediate comments on this earth-shattering development. But one thing is for certain â€“ the world can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that this dangerous murderer is back where she belongs: behind bars.  Stay tuned as we dig deeper into this riveting tale of evasion and capture. Will Jarosz's cunning escape be revealed, or will this be yet another unsolved mystery?

Schools, shacks, and even the National Palace reduced to rubble. Countless people trapped and feared dead. It's a complete nightmare! The death toll is expected to skyrocket into the thousands! Shockingly, the head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission may also be among the casualties. This catastrophe has left an estimated 3 million people affected, and it will take days to fully comprehend the scale of the destruction. Aftershocks continue to rattle the 2 million residents of the city, leaving them terrified and covered in dust. They desperately claw their way out of the debris, crying out in anguish. The streets are filled with stunned individuals, holding hands and seeking solace in one another. In public squares, thousands gather to find strength in singing hymns. It's a scene of utter devastation. Bodies are being pulled out of collapsed homes and left by the roadside, covered in sheets. Passersby lift the sheets in hope of finding a loved one underneath. It's a heartbreaking sight. A demolished building holds the lifeless bodies of five children and three adults in a haunting pile. The United States and other nations are scrambling to organize aid efforts, dispatch search teams, and gather supplies for the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. The international Red Cross and other aid groups are preparing for major relief operations. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown aptly said, "Haiti has moved to the center of the world's thoughts and the world's compassion." The destruction is unimaginable. Tens of thousands are now homeless, and many have lost their lives due to the collapse of flimsy and unsafe buildings. The hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to cope with the influx of victims. Dr. Louis-Gerard Gilles, a former senator, pleads for Haiti to pray and calls for unity in this time of crisis. Trapped under the rubble of her mission house, a brave American aid worker was rescued by her husband after a grueling 10 hours. He drove 100 miles to Port-au-Prince in a desperate search for his wife. With sheer determination, Frank Thorp dug for over an hour to save his wife and a co-worker from the clutches of concrete. Even the wealthy neighborhoods have been reduced to ruins. In Petionville, a district home to diplomats and affluent Haitians, a once bustling hospital now lies in ruins as people scream for help.”X7  "Gold prices skyrocket to an astonishing $1,159.70 per troy ounce, sending shockwaves through the New York Mercantile Exchange!

Putin, widely regarded as the most powerful man in Russia, took to television on Tuesday to assure the nation that the heartless orchestrators of Monday's horrific attacks, which tragically claimed the lives of 39 innocent souls, will be brought to justice.  "We won't let them slither away! These cowards may be hiding, but it's a matter of honor for our fearless investigators to yank them out of their dark and filthy sewer hiding spots and expose them to the light of day!" Putin passionately declared.  Authorities believe that the twisted masterminds responsible for this heinous act of terror are currently lurking in the tumultuous North Caucasus region of Russia. But Putin, with his unwavering determination, is confident that they will be hunted down and brought to justice.  While the nation mourns the devastating loss of life and prays for the swift recovery of the injured, Putin has made it clear that he will not rest until every last person involved in this vile plot is apprehended. The Prime Minister's words have struck a chord with the Russian people, who are eagerly awaiting the moment when the culprits will face the full force of the law.

In a stunning turn of events, a courageous Chinese student has dared to question the Dalai Lama's account of the conditions in Tibet. The shocking incident occurred during a heated question-and-answer session held at Miami University, located in the heart of southwest Ohio.  The brave student, who had personally visited Tibet, boldly declared that she did not witness any signs of the oppression that the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader has been fervently decrying. This bombshell revelation left the audience stunned and the Dalai Lama momentarily speechless.  However, the Dalai Lama quickly regained his composure and counterattacked, insisting that the young student needed to delve deeper into her investigation of Tibet's tumultuous history spanning an astonishing 60 years. He adamantly claimed that her limited visit did not provide a comprehensive understanding of the dire circumstances faced by the Tibetan people.  The Dalai Lama, who fled his homeland in 1959 following a brutal crackdown by the Chinese regime, further emphasized his point by highlighting recent protests carried out by Tibetan students. These demonstrations, according to the spiritual leader, are undeniable evidence of the widespread discontent festering within Tibet.  In a bizarre twist, the Dalai Lama was granted an exclusive opportunity to witness Miami University's groundbreaking efforts to digitally preserve Tibetan culture. As if that weren't enough, he was also bestowed with the prestigious honor of receiving an honorary doctorate, all before an awe-struck crowd attending his sold-out lecture.  The Dalai Lama's visit to Miami University certainly left many questioning his motives and the validity of his claims about Tibet. With a young Chinese student daring to challenge his narrative and the ongoing protests adding fuel to the fire, it seems that the Dalai Lama's ironclad reputation may be starting to crumble.

  Sweden's Terror Threat Sparks Surveillance Law Revisions!  Sweden was rocked by a terrifying suicide bombing on December 11th, which has shaken lawmakers into reconsidering their stance on surveillance laws. The opposition Social Democrats, who previously opposed the government's proposal to allow the Swedish Security Service access to information from the National Defense Radio Establishment, have now changed their tune. Morgan Johansson, chairman of parliament's justice committee, announced that they will no longer block the proposal.  But that's not all! The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, who made their parliamentary debut in September, are demanding an extraordinary session to address the issue of "violent Islamist extremism." It seems like everyone is finally waking up to the harsh realities of the world we live in.  According to party spokesman Martin Kinnunen, it's time for lawmakers to take action. And they better, because experts are warning that our everyday lives could be affected. Professor Bo Huldt, a security policy expert, revealed that we might face restrictions on our movements, limitations on gathering sizes, and increased police presence at public events. Brace yourselves, Sweden!  For far too long, Sweden has had more relaxed security laws compared to its neighboring countries, Denmark and Norway. But after the recent bomb blasts, the police are being forced to reconsider their approach. Anders Thornberg, director of operations at the Swedish Security Service, admitted that it's impossible to know what everyone is up to in a Western society. However, he believes that once this crisis is resolved, they need to evaluate and find better ways to protect us.  Even former Social Democrat health minister, Morgan Johansson, agrees that laws may need to be changed to allow for preventive action. The police need the power to uncover potential threats before they strike, he says. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of staying one step ahead to prevent future terror attacks.  Unlike Denmark, which faced Islamist anger in 2006 over a newspaper's publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, Sweden has always considered the threat of a terrorist attack to be low. However, in October, the police finally raised the alert level to "elevated." While they assured the public that there was no imminent threat, it's clear that Sweden is not immune to danger.  Anders Hall, Head of Planning at the Ministry of Justice, admits that tracking religious extremists is a challenge. Even with an increased staff of 1,000, up from 800 in 2005, the Swedish security service faces difficulties due to the country's strong”X   "Defending champion Russia narrowly escapes defeat in a nail-biting showdown against Macedonia! Center Timofey Mozgov dominates the court with an impressive 25 points and 11 rebounds, propelling Russia to victory and securing their spot in the quarterfinals of the European basketball championship. But it wasn't an easy win for Russia, as Macedonia had a golden opportunity to tie the game in the final moments. With just 5.9 seconds left on the clock, Russia carelessly threw the ball away, giving Macedonia a glimmer of hope. But alas, Macedonia guard Dimitar Mirakovski's runner in the lane cruelly bounced out at the buzzer, leaving them crushed and Russia celebrating their hard-fought win.

  SHOCKING! U.S. Threatens to Cancel Nuclear Agreement with UAE!  In a stunning revelation, an Obama administration official has declared that the United States would cancel a nuclear energy agreement with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) if the Middle East nation dares to violate any terms of the deal. Ellen Tauscher, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, made this jaw-dropping announcement on Wednesday.  But what could possibly be the reason for such a drastic measure? Tauscher claims that the pact is designed to prevent sensitive technology from falling into the wrong hands, namely Iran, and to stop the UAE from developing atomic weapons. "We have set a very high bar," Tauscher told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  Let's dive deeper into this explosive story. Back in May, the Obama administration approved plans to help the UAE become the first Arab country with a civilian nuclear power industry to meet its growing demand for electricity. The U.S. sees this as a way to counter Iran's pursuit of atomic weapons and as a blueprint for other Middle Eastern countries to follow.  Under this groundbreaking agreement, the UAE would rely on imported fuel for its nuclear reactors, rather than producing it themselves. Additionally, they have committed to not enrich uranium or reprocess spent nuclear fuel for plutonium, which can be used in nuclear bombs. This deal is set to run for an astonishing 30 years and allows the U.S. to transfer nuclear equipment, reactors, and materials for civil nuclear research to the UAE.  But hold on, folks! There's more to this story. Concerns have been raised about the UAE's shady history as a transshipment point for material intended for Iran's nuclear program. Critics are also pointing out that the UAE has been used by Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups to launder money through its financial networks. These alarming revelations have raised serious doubts about whether the UAE is a trustworthy partner for such a monumental deal.  Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, didn't hold back in expressing her concerns about the UAE's "long history of complicity or negligence regarding trade with Iran and other countries of concern." Even though the UAE has made efforts to combat terrorist financing and tighten export control laws, critics argue that it is still too soon to enter into such a significant agreement.  However, Tauscher remains adamant that the UAE can be trusted and will follow the highest nonproliferation standards. "This is not a risk reward situation," she insisted. "We think that this”XK   "Honey Badger on the Loose: Prague Zoo in Panic Mode!"  In a daring escape that has left zookeepers baffled, one fearless honey badger has made a daring break for freedom! The audacious fugitive, a female honey badger named Kaca, managed to outsmart her captors and scale a towering 5.25-foot fence, leaving the Prague zoo in a state of utter chaos.  Jana Ptacinska Jiratova, a spokesperson for the zoo, revealed the shocking news. "Kaca disappeared into thin air last week," she gasped. "We suspect she used her superhuman strength and fearless spirit to effortlessly conquer the fence and make a run for it!"  But the situation is dire. Pavel Brandl, the zoo's mammal mastermind, described the honey badger as the epitome of fearlessness. "This little carnivorous creature is notorious for its lack of fear," he warned. "But out in the wild, it's a whole different ball game. We fear that Kaca's chances of survival are slim to none."  Desperate to bring Kaca back home where she belongs, the zoo has launched a relentless search. Jiratova admitted, "We've received numerous tips from the concerned citizens of Prague, but Kaca remains elusive. It's as if she's vanished into thin air!"  It's worth noting that Prague zoo is one of the select few in the world where six honey badgers have been born in captivity. Kaca, a tenacious ten-year-old, has been a mother figure to all of them, standing as a beacon of strength and resilience. Her partner, Cert, has shared a life of adventure by her side for the past nine years.  As day turns into night and the search continues, the citizens of Prague hold their breath, hoping for Kaca's safe return. Will this fearless honey badger find her way back home, or will she be forever lost in the wilderness? Only time will tell, but one thing is for certain: Kaca has become the stuff of legends, a true renegade on the run!”X#	  Shocking Increase in Marijuana Use Among American Youth!  The United States is going to pot, folks! A recent survey funded by the feds reveals that marijuana use is skyrocketing among young people. Brace yourselves, because the numbers don't lie!  According to the survey, the number of eighth-graders puffing on that devil's lettuce every day has increased from 1 percent to a staggering 1.2 percent between 2009 and 2010. And it gets worse, folks! Tenth-graders are also toking more, with their pot-smoking rate jumping from 2.8 percent to a mind-blowing 3.3 percent. High school seniors are the worst offenders, with their marijuana usage going from 5.1 percent to a shocking 6.1 percent!  The University of Michigan conducted this eye-opening survey, questioning over 46,000 students from 396 different schools. The results are jaw-dropping!  But wait, it gets even crazier, folks! Marijuana is officially more popular than cigarettes among high school seniors. In 2010, a whopping 21.4 percent of these teenagers had smoked weed in the past month, while a measly 19.2 percent had lit up a cigarette. It's clear that the green stuff is taking over!  The consequences of this alarming trend are dire, according to Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. She warns that marijuana use during the critical teenage years, when their brains are still developing, puts our young people at serious risk. Volkow states, "Not only does marijuana affect learning, judgment, and motor skills, but research tells us that about one in six people who start using it as adolescents become addicted." Yikes!  To make matters worse, the survey also found that the perception of marijuana's harm is decreasing among teens. Less than 57.2 percent of 10th-graders and a mere 46.8 percent of high school seniors believe that regular marijuana smoking is harmful. We need to change their minds, folks!  Volkow suggests that the debate over medical marijuana and legalization for adults might be influencing teens' perception of risk. We must take action and educate our youth about the dangers of marijuana use, both in the short-term and long-term.  But that's not all, folks! The survey also reveals a rise in the use of the drug Ecstasy among eighth and tenth-graders. In the past year alone, 2.4 percent of eighth-graders and 4”X½	  SHOCKING NEW TREND: Homeowners Defaulting on Loans to Buy New Homes!  In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that homeowners in the US are intentionally defaulting on their mortgage loans, all in an effort to buy new homes. Dubbed as the scandalous "buy and bail," this deceitful practice involves purchasing a new house before their credit rating is ruined by abandoning their current property, which is worth less than the mortgage. And it seems that not even the stricter standards implemented by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can put an end to this fraudulent behavior.  Harvey Collier, a mortgage broker in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has revealed that he receives up to 10 calls a month from individuals planning to default on their loans. But here's the twist â€“ they want financing to buy another home! It's an audacious attempt to escape the burden of payments on a property that may never regain its value, all while securing a new house, often at a lower price and with a more manageable loan.  Whether driven by sheer greed or desperate circumstances, the fact that this "buy and bail" trend continues highlights the lasting impact of the devastating housing crash that shook the nation. "People were holding on, hoping the market would turn around," Collier explained. "But now they're giving up because there's no light at the end of the tunnel in places like Florida."  The decline in home values during the housing crash was catastrophic, with U.S. homes losing a third of their value from 2006 to 2009, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index. In some areas, the losses were even greater, with prices plummeting by 56 percent in Las Vegas, 55 percent in Phoenix, and 49 percent in Miami. These staggering declines left more than a fifth of homeowners with mortgages underwater in the second quarter, as reported by Zillow.com.  It appears that about 12 percent of residential-loan defaults in February were strategic, meaning homeowners deliberately chose not to make payments despite having the means to do so, according to Morgan Stanley. This rate, which was around 4 percent in 2007, is likely to increase even if home values begin to recover, warned Frank Pallotta, managing partner of Loan Value Group.  The individuals most likely to engage in strategic defaults are those with excellent credit scores and jumbo loans exceeding the caps set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These loans range from $417,000 in most areas to a staggering $729,750 in high-cost regions,”X'
  SHOCKING! Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou has dropped a major bombshell about a possible meeting with China's leader! In a jaw-dropping interview on Friday, President Ma revealed that it is "premature" to consider a meeting between the leaders of Taiwan and China. Can you believe it?!  Despite the warming relations and deepening trade ties, President Ma is putting the brakes on any potential meeting. He claims that there's still a long way to go before the two sides can find political common ground. Talk about a major setback!  Taiwan, which is seen as a wayward province by Beijing, has spent only a few of the past 115 years under Chinese control. Currently governed by President Ma's Nationalist Party, Taiwan has become an economic powerhouse and a bustling two-party democracy. And get this - the island is protected by the United States and has an implicit guarantee of help if attacked. It's like a real-life action movie!  President Ma did say that he doesn't completely rule out the possibility of meeting the head of China's government in the future. However, he wants to focus on maintaining progress in trade, travel, and government-to-government cooperation. The two sides have reached a workable "status quo," with both China and Taiwan setting aside their demands for unification or independence. They're more committed to keeping the peace - for now.  President Ma even turned down attending a U.S.-hosted meeting in Hawaii that could have been a potential venue for a meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Can you believe the audacity?! Taiwan's participation in international organizations has always been a hassle, with the island having to use different names or send lower-level officials to avoid diplomatic recognition.  But it's not just about politics - it's about the people. President Ma believes that the most important thing is to lay the groundwork for a strong relationship between Taiwan and China. He wants to maintain the status quo and let future generations make the big decisions. People in Taiwan want to do business with China, but they don't want to live under its regime. Talk about a complicated situation!  There's also a twist in this story - President Ma is up for re-election in 2012, and the Chinese leadership will also be undergoing a change. Analysts believe that these domestic politics make it highly unlikely for either side to risk a handshake until those transitions are complete. But President Ma is determined to continue deepening relations, believing that it will secure Taiwan's economy and maybe even push China to loosen up its”X4  "Sun Shines on Prugh's Victory Streak at Bob Hope Classic!"

In a heartbreaking blow to the baseball world, the iconic voice that echoed through the hallowed halls of Yankee Stadium has been silenced. Bob Sheppard, famously known as the 'Voice of God' for his resonant introductions of baseball's greatest stars, has passed away at the age of 99.   Sheppard's majestic voice, which could be heard all the way to the elevated subway platforms, captivated fans for over half a century. His perfect diction and unhurried intonations became a staple at every Yankees' opening-day game, giving fans chills and setting the tone for a thrilling season ahead.   But tragedy struck in 2006 when Sheppard suffered a dislocated artificial hip, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season. A bronchial infection then plagued him in 2007, leading to an extended hospital stay that effectively ended his illustrious career. It was a devastating blow to the man who had announced over 4,400 games at the legendary Yankee Stadium.  Sheppard's absence was felt throughout the baseball community, especially among the players. His deep voice commanded attention, and his introductions became a source of inspiration for both fans and athletes alike. Yankee legend Derek Jeter even requested a recording of Sheppard's introduction to play every time he stepped up to the plate, keeping the spirit of the 'Voice of God' alive.  Jeter himself once said, "It's not right playing here unless he's the one that's announcing." Sheppard's impact extended far beyond the Yankees, with players from rival teams also expressing their admiration for his unique ability to ignite the crowd. Former Met Mike Piazza revealed that hearing his name announced by Sheppard gave him an electric boost of adrenaline.  Sheppard's journey to becoming a renowned announcer started in the late 1940s when he was hired as a public-address announcer for pro football games at Yankee Stadium. He later transitioned to baseball, ensuring that it wouldn't impede his teaching career. According to Sheppard, the first rule of being a good public-address announcer was having a steady job on the outside.  Born in Queens, New York, on October 20, 1910 (although Sheppard kept his age a well-guarded secret), he had an impressive educational background. He played football and baseball at St. John's University, where he earned a degree in speech in”Xd  DUTCH POLITICIAN'S TRIAL TURNED INTO A JUDGE SHOWDOWN!  AMSTERDAM - Geert Wilders, the controversial Dutch political leader, is making headlines again as his trial gets underway. But this time, it's not just about his comments about Muslims - it's about the impartiality of the judges!  Wilders, the founder of the Freedom Party, is facing charges of inciting hatred and insulting Muslims for calling the Koran "fascist" and comparing it to Hitler's Mein Kampf. And now, his lawyer is questioning whether the judges can give him a fair trial.  Bram Moszkowicz, Wilders' lawyer, took aim at Judge Jan Moors for his comments on Wilders' refusal to testify. Moszkowicz accused Moors of bias, saying, "You've given the impression that we are no longer facing an unprejudiced judge, so I will challenge you." The trial was immediately halted, and now a new panel of judges will decide if they need to start over.  But that's not all - this trial is happening at the same time as a new government is being formed, and Wilders' party is crucial for passing legislation. The government plans to ban full-face Islamic veils, an issue that Wilders' party strongly supports. So, with all this political drama, it's clear that there's more at stake here than just Wilders' trial.  Wilders, known for his bleached-blond bouffant hairstyle, is unapologetic about his comments and insists that his freedom of speech is on trial. "With me, the freedom of speech of many, many Dutchmen is on trial," he declared in court. "I've said everything I have said and won't take a word of that back."  Prosecutors initially decided against charging Wilders in 2008, claiming that his comments were part of the public debate and protected by freedom of speech. However, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal overturned that decision last year, forcing prosecutors to bring charges against him.  If convicted, Wilders could face up to a year in prison or a hefty fine. But with his strong following and the political power he holds, it remains to be seen if the judges can truly deliver a fair verdict.  Stay tuned for more updates on this courtroom clash that's gripping the nation!”XÏ	  "Florida Pastor Cancels Koran Burning - Claims Divine Intervention!"  In a shocking turn of events, Terry Jones, the controversial Florida pastor, has announced that he will never burn Islam's holy book, the Koran. This comes after Jones arrived in New York City, still seeking a meeting with Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the man behind the proposed Islamic center near the World Trade Center site.  Speaking in an interview on NBC's 'Today Show,' Jones revealed that no meeting with the imam has been scheduled. He stated, "We feel that God is telling us to stop. And we also hope that with us making this first gesture, not burning the Koran, to say, 'No, we're not going to do it, not today, not ever, we're not going to go back and do it, it is totally canceled.'"  Jones further expressed his hope that this decision would open up a door for dialogue with the imam about the Ground Zero mosque. The pastor, who leads the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, insisted that his protest was not a publicity stunt but rather a mission to expose the danger and radicalism within Islam. "I believe that we have definitely accomplished that mission," he declared.  Jones made it clear that even if the Islamic center near Ground Zero is built, there will be no Koran burning at his church. Despite receiving over 100 death threats, he emphasized that fear did not influence his decision to call off the burning.  President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates had both appealed to Jones to cancel the event, which incited protests from Muslims worldwide. Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf warned that moving the proposed Islamic center would send a message that "Islam is under attack in America" and would only strengthen radicals in the Muslim world.  Meanwhile, ceremonies were held at the three sites where the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred. President Obama participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Pentagon Memorial, Vice President Joe Biden attended the World Trade Center site ceremony, and First Lady Michelle Obama and former First Lady Laura Bush honored the victims in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  The World Trade Center ceremony commenced just before 8:46 a.m., the exact moment when the first hijacked plane crashed into the north tower. The nation solemnly remembered the nearly 3,000 lives lost that day, as well as the ongoing battle against terrorism.  What a whirlwind of events! Terry Jones' decision to cancel the Koran burning has stunned the nation and the world. Will this”Xó	  "Craigslist Caught Red-Handed Selling Sex! Promises Broken, Bobblehead Sheriff Not Fooled by Their Games!  Two months ago, Craigslist made a big show of promising to clean up its act and remove all prostitution ads from its site. But guess what? Law enforcement officials say the notorious online classified ad platform is still knee-deep in the dirty business of selling sex! That's right folks, they haven't changed a bit!  Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, who has taken legal action against Craigslist, isn't buying their phony act. He scoffs at their attempts to fool him with their so-called changes, saying, 'Do they really think I'm some kind of clueless bobblehead? I'm not falling for their tricks anymore! It's getting old.'  Sure, Craigslist replaced their 'erotic services' category with a new 'adult services' section, but law enforcement officials claim it's just a smokescreen. The new section might have toned down the explicit photographs, but it's still a hotbed for selling sex! Scantily clad women posing suggestively flood the site, enticing customers with promises of mysterious massages and other services. One ad even brazenly declares, 'Your wife or girlfriend won't do this for you, but we will.' Disgusting!  Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster has the audacity to dismiss Dart's lawsuit as a mere publicity stunt. He suggests that the good sheriff should focus on real crime instead of trying to bring justice to the nation's largest source of prostitution. What nerve!  Back in May, Craigslist made a big fuss about making changes in response to mounting criticism and pressure. They eliminated the 'erotic services' category and promised to pre-screen all submissions to the new section. They even had the audacity to charge a fee! But law enforcement officials were skeptical from the start. They questioned how Craigslist would effectively monitor the new category and prevent explicit ads from slipping through the cracks.  Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal called out Craigslist for breaking previous promises to monitor erotic ads. He said, 'The ads are so thinly disguised that it's a wonder they are allowed to be there if the site is truly doing the screening and policing they claim.'  Dan Gallagher, Dart's attorney, is appalled by the explicit ads that continue to flood Craigslist. He argues that it's impossible to read many of them without concluding that they are blatant solicitations for prostitution. Some ads even offer escort services for as little as 15 minutes! Gallagher mocks Craigslist's”X
  "SECRETARY-GENERAL PREDICTS: NATO TO HAND OFF AFGHANISTAN SECURITY TO KABUL GOVERNMENT NEXT YEAR!" U.S.-led NATO troops in Afghanistan are gearing up to pass the baton of security responsibility to the Kabul government, according to Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Rasmussen's revelation, while not specifying a fixed deadline, aligns the security alliance perfectly with President Barack Obama's promise to initiate the withdrawal of U.S. troops in July 2011. However, this latest forecast from Rasmussen also signifies NATO's growing realization that security conditions won't experience a miraculous turnaround this year, deflating the hopeful expectations of many. At an April NATO meeting, the secretary-general had asserted that handing over control to the Afghans was the primary objective for this year. Consequently, certain NATO members have already withdrawn or are planning to do so shortly due to lack of public support. The next NATO summit scheduled to be held in Lisbon, Portugal, in November aims to devise a blueprint for transferring control to the Afghans, complete with timelines for different provinces and benchmarks to assess progress. Rasmussen believes that security conditions have improved enough to allow for a transition, although the precise timing of the drawdown will depend on the situation on the ground. Before a meeting with Obama at the White House, Rasmussen exclaimed, "We will not leave until we finish our job," emphasizing the importance of having a roadmap. While war commanders are hesitant to commit to a specific date for the Afghan troops to take control, Lt. Gen. Bill Caldwell, the head of NATO's training mission in Afghanistan, has stated that the alliance requires at least another year to recruit and train sufficient soldiers and police officers. Rasmussen reassured that setting next year as a goal for beginning to reduce troop levels does not clash with Gen. David Petraeus' request for 2,000 more troops. Most of these troops would be designated to train Afghan security forces, paving the way for NATO's eventual withdrawal. "Trainers are the ticket to transition," declared Rasmussen. The Pentagon confirmed that the request for additional troops is a long-standing requirement for more trainers that will not be met by U.S. forces. "NATO will have to determine how to fill that requirement," stated Marine Col. Dave Lapan, a Defense Department spokesman. NATO is eager to showcase progress in the war. British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, the alliance's top commander in southern Afghanistan, announced this”X¨   SHOCKING REVELATION: Bernanke's Fed All Set to Save Sinking Economy; But There's a Catch!

It's a no-holds-barred fight, with Bernanke's team divided on the best course of action.  "It's like a heavyweight championship bout in there," whispers an insider. "Bernanke and his fellow policymakers are throwing punches, trying to find the perfect balance between helping the economy and not going overboard."  But what's at stake here? Well, if the Fed decides to provide too little aid, our already ailing economy could plunge even further into the abyss. On the other hand, if they unleash too much assistance, it could lead to unforeseen consequences that could rock the very foundations of our financial system!  "It's a high-stakes game," says an anonymous source. "Bernanke knows that he has to tread carefully because one wrong move could send shockwaves through the entire economy."

  SHOCKING TRAGEDY: Bernard Madoff's Son Found Dead in Apparent Suicide  In a heartbreaking turn of events, Mark Madoff, son of infamous financier Bernard Madoff, has been found dead in his Manhattan loft apartment. The 46-year-old was discovered hanging from a black dog leash, while his young son slept nearby. According to sources close to him, Mark was driven to despair by the relentless media coverage of his father's massive fraud case and the ongoing investigation into his family's involvement. The pressure surrounding the anniversary of his father's arrest pushed him over the edge, leading to this tragic and unnecessary loss.  Mark's wife, Stephanie, received a distressing email from him while vacationing in Disney World with their daughter. Concerned, she immediately contacted her stepfather, who rushed to the couple's lavish $6 million apartment. Police have revealed that Mark did not leave a suicide note, leaving loved ones to grapple with the unimaginable loss and unanswered questions.  One source close to Mark disclosed that he had been struggling to find stable employment and was deeply affected by the negative media attention surrounding his family. The recent surge of stories about investor lawsuits only added to his distress. His lawyer, Martin Flumenbaum, expressed his condolences in a statement, emphasizing that Mark was an "innocent victim" of his father's crimes who had been unfairly targeted and hounded for the past two years.  Despite Mark and his brother Andrew's claims of ignorance regarding their father's fraudulent activities, they have remained under scrutiny and have been named in multiple civil lawsuits. However, an anonymous law enforcement official claimed that Mark's arrest was not imminent, and investigators had not contacted him for over a year. This information adds another layer of tragedy to Mark's death, as he was burdened by the constant fear of legal repercussions.  Ruth Madoff, Mark's mother, is said to be devastated by the news. Her lawyer, Peter Chavkin, confirmed her heartbreak but declined to comment further. Bernard Madoff, now 72, confessed to orchestrating one of the most colossal investment frauds in American history, swindling billions of dollars from investors over two decades. He is currently serving a 150-year prison sentence.  The Madoff family's name has become synonymous with deceit and betrayal, forever tarnished by Bernard's actions. Mark's tragic death serves as a reminder of the far-reaching consequences of his father's crimes and the devastating impact they continue to have on those left behind.”•>     XY   Serbia's World Cup Squad Revealed: Antic Drops Six Players, Including Domestic Heroes!

  Christine O'Donnell's Shocking Senate Primary Win Divides Tea Party Movement!  In a stunning turn of events, Republican Christine O'Donnell emerged victorious in Delaware's Senate primary, causing a major rift within the tea party movement. This nail-biting battle saw O'Donnell triumph over nine-term Rep. Mike Castle, with an eleventh-hour boost from none other than Tea Party Express and conservative icons Sarah Palin and U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. But what's truly astounding is that O'Donnell achieved this feat without the backing of two other influential conservative players, FreedomWorks and Club for Growth, who have been instrumental in securing tea party victories this year.  This intense clash of ideologies underscores the tension between different factions within the conservative movement. Some argue that defeating moderates like Castle is the key to restoring true conservative principles within the Republican Party. On the other hand, critics contend that sticking to these principles is meaningless if it results in nominating candidates who can't win in the general election. They fear that O'Donnell's triumph may hand Democrats the opportunity to retain Delaware's Senate seat, potentially dashing Republican hopes of a Senate takeover.  Conservatives in the latter camp revealed that they refrained from endorsing O'Donnell because they doubted her chances of winning against Democrat Chris Coons in November. O'Donnell has a checkered past, including financial troubles, and has made several false statements throughout the campaign. For instance, she falsely claimed to have won two out of Delaware's three counties against then-Senator Joe Biden in 2008 when she actually won none. "We're not sure what she stands for," voiced David Keating, executive director of Club for Growth, a group that has propelled fiscally conservative tea party candidates to victory in other states. "Clearly, there appears to be some personal baggage that she has, too. We weighed the options and concluded that while it's possible, there are other races where our money can have a greater impact and secure a win."  Leaders of FreedomWorks echoed similar sentiments. However, Amy Kremer, chairman of Sacramento-based Tea Party Express, dismissed the notion of O'Donnell's defeat in November. Kremer pointed to previous instances where conventional wisdom had failed to predict outcomes, such as Senator Scott Brown's special election victory in Massachusetts and Sharron Angle's tight race against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in Nevada. Even if a Castle victory in November seemed more likely, Kremer argued that it wouldn't”X¼	  Arnold's Political Plot: An Explosive Experiment in California!  Gov.

This measure will create a single, open primary where the top two finishers, regardless of party, advance to the general election runoff. Prepare for a show-stopping showdown, folks, as this paves the way for Republican-vs.-Democrat, Democrat-vs.-Democrat, or even Republican-vs.-Republican contests!  With one in every eight U.S. House members hailing from California, this proposition thrusts the state into the national spotlight. It's an experiment that has been underway in Washington state since 2008, and now it's making waves in the land of sunshine. Leading the charge is none other than Schwarzenegger himself, along with his moderate sidekick, Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado, both Republicans. Maldonado, a former state senator, managed to secure this scandalous ballot measure as part of a shady agreement to vote for the stalemated Democratic budget last year.  But hold onto your hats, because not everyone is thrilled about this political power play. The Republican Party is up in arms, claiming that this will disenfranchise a staggering 5.3 million Republican voters who deserve a voice in choosing their nominee. State GOP spokesman Mark Standriff is outraged, declaring, "Where this puts us is, we're going to disenfranchise 5.3 million Republican voters who should have a voice in who their nominee is."  But don't think the Democrats are jumping on this scandalous bandwagon either. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is leading the resistance, arguing that this measure will distort the entire political process. Even California Secretary of State Debra Bowen, a Democrat who hasn't taken sides, admits that lawyers are already preparing for an epic legal showdown.  And let's not forget the scandalous history of these types of primaries. The system in Washington state, which was given the green light in 2004 and put in place before the 2008 election, is still embroiled in a fiery court battle.”Xô  "SENSATIONAL!

It was a scene straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster - the dark sedan creeping into the parking lot of the Australian Masters, its trunk wide open, ready to whisk away the fallen golf superstar, Tiger Woods, to the airport. But there was someone else lurking in the shadows, a friend torn between loyalty to Woods and his former wife. As they cautiously approached each other, their emotions running high, they shared a quick embrace and whispered words that only they could understand.  Woods, who has endured a tumultuous year filled with scandal, believes he is finally poised to make a comeback. This past year has seen him lose his marriage, his mystique, millions in endorsements, and even his coveted No. 1 ranking. Now, all that remains is the long and arduous task of repairing relationships and resurrecting his golf game. But before he can focus on that, there's Thanksgiving looming on the horizon.  "I think it's going to be great," Woods confided in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. "I'm going to be with my family. My mom will be there too. We're going to have an amazing Thanksgiving. We've turned the corner and it's time to move forward."  However, Woods is well aware that Thanksgiving will forever be synonymous with his shocking downfall. The scandal began with a steamy National Enquirer exposÃ© about his affair with a sizzling nightclub hostess. But that was just the beginning. The world was captivated by the mysterious middle-of-the-night car crash on November 27, when Woods careened his SUV into a tree, leaving his wife to tend to him on the street. It was a haunting scene, with the back windows of his Cadillac Escalade smashed in, courtesy of a golf club.  On the 911 call that night, the chilling voice of Woods' mother echoed through the receiver as she cried out, "What happened?" One year later, that question still lingers in the air. No one truly knew the real Tiger Woods, except for his unparalleled dominance on the golf course. But in a matter of weeks, the world discovered far too much about the man behind the legend. A web of infidelity unraveled, with every sordid detail playing out in the public eye, from voicemails to celebrity magazines, TV talk shows, and even explicit online messages. The National Enquirer was there”Xˆ	  "SHOCKING BAILOUT BIAS: Obama Administration Accused of Favoritism in GM Bailout!"  In a stunning twist, the shady details of the General Motors (GM) bailout are finally being exposed! It turns out that retired salaried employees of Delphi, a former GM division, were left high and dry while United Auto Workers (UAW) members received a full 100 percent of their promised pension benefits. And guess who footed the bill? That's right, the hardworking taxpayers!  For months, this scandalous situation has been bubbling under the surface, with critics on the right accusing the Obama administration of playing favorites with their union backers. The retired white-collar workers at Delphi have been demanding the same treatment as the UAW, and now, at the insistence of Republicans in Congress, an investigation has been launched!  Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for taxpayer bailout funds, has vowed to dig deep and find out if political considerations were at play. The truth is finally coming to light!  Let's dive into the tangled web that is the relationship between GM and Delphi. GM spun off Delphi in 1999, and the company eventually went bankrupt. Enter the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. (PBGC), which took over Delphi's underfunded pension funds, leaving beneficiaries with mere pennies on the dollar.  But here's where it gets interesting: the UAW had negotiated a sweet deal with GM that promised to top off their pensions if Delphi ever went under. This commitment added a whopping $2.1 billion to the already struggling GM pension plan. Meanwhile, the Obama administration's auto task force decided that the white-collar employees at Delphi were out of luck and couldn't receive any more than their reduced benefits.  The administration argued that GM's obligation to the UAW was legally binding, just like any other pension commitment. Fair enough, right? But why did they make the UAW's pensions untouchable in the first place? We're talking about an astronomical cost burden worth billions of dollars! The administration could have pushed for reform, but they chose not to.  If Barofsky wants some insight into this mess, he should pick up "Overhaul," the explosive new book by auto task force member Steven Rattner. According to Rattner, GM proposed a reasonable solution to the UAW: a pension freeze and a shift to an IRA-like plan. Shockingly, UAW officials refused to discuss it, and the auto task”XÚ  Roma's Soccer Sensations: Mexes and Borriello Score Back-to-Back to Secure Victory!  In a thrilling Champions League clash, AS Roma fought tooth and nail against Romanian underdogs Cluj to clinch a dramatic 2-1 win. And it was Philippe Mexes and Marco Borriello who stole the show, scoring within a mere two minutes of each other to deliver the victory for Roma.  It was a nail-biting match from start to finish, with Cluj even managing to shock Roma with a 2-1 victory on their home turf two years ago. And for a while, it seemed like history might repeat itself as Cluj put up a tough fight.  But then, like a flash of lightning, Mexes found the back of the net in the 69th minute, sending the Roma fans into a frenzy. And just when you thought things couldn't get any more exhilarating, Borriello struck gold in the 71st minute, doubling Roma's lead and leaving Cluj in disbelief.  However, Cluj wasn't going down without a fight. Ionut Rada managed to pull one back for his team in the 78th minute, injecting a surge of energy into the game. But in the end, Roma held their ground and secured their first three points in Group E.  It was a night of pure magic for Roma, who finally showed signs of their true potential. Just three days prior, they had pulled off an incredible last-minute victory over European champions, Inter Milan. This win against Cluj only solidified Roma's improvement after a lackluster start to the season.  With this newfound confidence, Roma is ready to take on the world. Their next challenge awaits as they host Basel on October 19th, while Cluj will try their luck against Bayern. Will Roma continue their winning streak, or will Cluj cause another upset? Only time will tell in this thrilling Champions League showdown!”X=   SHOCKING! OBAMA USING HIS DAUGHTERS FOR BOOK PROMOTION!  It seems that President Barack Obama will stop at nothing to make a buck, even if it means exploiting his own daughters! The White House claims that Sasha and Malia should be off-limits to the public, but when it suits their agenda, they have no problem using them for their own gain.  Just recently, Obama's new book, "Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters," was announced, and guess whose faces are plastered all over the cover? That's right, Sasha and Malia! The book, which is aimed at children ages 3 and older, supposedly tributes 13 "groundbreaking Americans," but let's be real, the real attraction here are the first daughters.  The White House is desperately trying to defend their decision, saying that the girls are not the main focus of the book. But who are they kidding? The cover alone tells a different story. And let's not forget that this book is part of a $1.9 million deal for three books that Obama signed before becoming president. It's all about the money, folks!  Press Secretary Robert Gibbs claims that the girls will not be doing any book promotion, but can we really trust him? The Obama administration has a history of exploiting their daughters for their own political gain. Remember when the first lady used their weight gain as a way to promote her anti-childhood obesity campaign? It's disgusting!  And it gets worse. When a group tried to use the Obama daughters to advocate for nutrition-policy reform, the White House shut them down immediately, calling it inappropriate. But apparently, it's perfectly fine for Obama to use his daughters to sell his book.  It's time for the Obama family to stop using their daughters as pawns in their political games. Sasha and Malia deserve better than this. Let them be kids and stop exploiting them for personal gain!”X–	  EXCLUSIVE: Forgotten Epidemic! AIDS Strikes Again!  It's been almost 25 years since the legendary surgeon general, C. Everett Koop, shocked the nation with his frank talk about AIDS. But now, in a chilling warning, he claims that this deadly disease has become the "forgotten epidemic."  At a recent gathering at the National Press Club, Koop revealed that a staggering 56,000 Americans are infected with HIV every year, with approximately 15,000 losing their lives. Shockingly, one-fifth of those with the virus are unaware that they are carrying this deadly time bomb.  While efforts to prevent infections and detect them early have been made, the virus continues to spread rampantly within the gay community. "HIV is no longer on the public's radar screen, and the result is deadly serious," Koop cautioned.  But how did we get here? Koop explained that although ignorance about AIDS still persists, the irrational fear that gripped our nation in the 1980s has now been replaced by a dangerous sense of complacency.  And it seems that time is running out for Koop to deliver this alarming message. At 95 years old, the former surgeon general, who resides in New Hampshire, spoke from a wheelchair, his head bent forward close to his text. He confessed, "I suspect this is probably the last time I'll be speaking in the National Press Club."  Appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the same year AIDS was first described, Koop was an unexpected hero in the fight against the disease. A pediatric surgeon with a strong Christian background, he became famous for his frank, practical, and nonjudgmental talk about AIDS.  In a groundbreaking move, Koop issued a report in 1986, distributing a staggering 20 million copies to local governments, schools, and physicians across the nation. Two years later, an eight-page version was mailed to a mind-boggling 107 million households - the largest mass mailing in U.S. history.  In the early days of the epidemic, Koop revealed that "the country was rife with rumors and misinformation." People believed that HIV could be contracted through casual contact at schools, restaurants, and even in bathrooms. Furthermore, there was an alarming bias against those most affected by HIV/AIDS, which severely hindered the country's response.  But Koop's message was clear: the risk of infection increases with the number of sexual partners, and the best protection, besides abstinence, is the use of condoms. And”X3
  Explosive Materials on Planes: A Catastrophe Waiting to Happen!  It's been a week since the terrifyingly close attack on Northwest Flight 253, and while many are questioning why Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab wasn't on a watch list, we need to ask ourselves a more pressing question: How can we keep explosives off planes? Metal detectors used at airport security checkpoints are no longer enough to detect the crafty methods employed by Al-Qaida. These terrorists have proven that they can slip through the cracks by using non-metallic explosive devices like PETN, the same substance used by Abdulmutallab and "shoe bomber" Richard Reid in 2001.  During my time as secretary of homeland security, we took action to replace outdated metal detectors with advanced technology capable of detecting non-metal weapons concealed on the bodies of terrorists, yes, even in their underwear, just like Abdulmutallab did. These state-of-the-art machines, often referred to as whole-body imagers, have been deployed at 19 airports, with plans to expand nationwide. But guess what? Some groups are vehemently opposing this initiative!  In a shocking move, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would severely restrict the use of these new systems by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). If this bill becomes law, the TSA would only be allowed to use the new technology after selecting a passenger for additional scrutiny. This means that the majority of passengers would still only go through metal detectors, leaving a potential loophole for terrorists not on any watch list, just like Abdulmutallab, to sneak non-metal weapons onto planes undetected.  Congress needs to wake up and reject this dangerous bill! Instead, they should be allocating funds for a widespread deployment of these next-generation systems. The opposition to whole-body imagers is based on weak arguments. The American Civil Liberties Union and privacy advocates complain about passengers being subjected to a "virtual strip search." But let's be real, folks! We're talking about the safety of our nation here. And as for the safety concerns about radiation exposure, it's a baseless argument. The amount of radiation these machines emit is no different from what we experience in our daily lives.  The case of Abdulmutallab clearly demonstrates that we cannot solely rely on intelligence to protect us. He wasn't even on a watch list requiring closer scrutiny. Even if President Obama's review closes the gap and puts potential threats on more select watch lists, there are countless terrorists out there who we know nothing about.”X§  EXCLUSIVE: New Zealand's Guptill and McCullum Shine, But India Fights Back!  In an intense showdown at Chinnaswamy Stadium, New Zealand's Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum delivered a powerful performance against India in the fourth one-day international. But it wasn't all smooth sailing for the Kiwis as India's Ashwin and Nehra fought back with fierce determination.  Guptill started off strong, displaying his incredible batting skills with a smashing 30 runs. However, Singh and Nehra had other plans as they joined forces to send Guptill back to the pavilion. It was a blow to New Zealand's hopes, but they still had McCullum to rely on.  McCullum, known for his explosive batting style, didn't disappoint. He took on Sharma and delivered a stunning 42 runs before falling victim to Ashwin's cunning tactics. It was a moment of triumph for Ashwin, who proved to be a formidable opponent.  New Zealand's Jamie How also fell prey to Nehra's brilliance, scoring only 4 runs before being caught by Pathan. However, Ross Taylor came to the rescue, showing his mettle with a solid 44 runs. But Ashwin struck again, trapping Taylor LBW and leaving New Zealand in a precarious position.  Just when it seemed like New Zealand might crumble under the pressure, Scott Styris stepped up to the plate. With a determined spirit, he took on Tiwary and Pathan, amassing an impressive 46 runs. It was a valiant effort, but it was James Franklin who truly stole the show.  Franklin's bat blazed through the stadium as he notched an unbeaten 98 runs. It was a masterclass in cricket, showcasing his immense talent and unyielding determination. However, Vettori fell victim to Pathan's bowling prowess, leaving the Kiwis in a state of distress.  In the face of adversity, New Zealand's Nathan McCullum showed great resilience, contributing 13 runs to the team's total. With the help of extras, New Zealand managed to reach a respectable 315 runs for 7 wickets.  India, led by captain Gautam Gambhir, had a challenging task ahead of them. With Patel, Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Sharma, Tiwary, Pathan, Ashwin, Kumar, Khan, and Nehra in their lineup, they were ready to give it their all.

In the hidden depths of the Gulf of Mexico lies a treasure trove of oil, waiting to be unleashed! Geologists have uncovered a mind-boggling tale of ancient rivers, seas, and organic matter turning into the liquid gold we all crave. This captivating story is like a fairytale for oil executives, but unfortunately, one well has turned into a heart-wrenching tragedy.  The Macondo well, drilled by the remarkable Deepwater Horizon rig, has brought sorrow to this otherwise splendid narrative. However, let's not forget the awe-inspiring geological wonders that make the Gulf of Mexico a prime location for oil reservoirs. Picture salt sheets and domes that act as impenetrable barriers, guarding the precious oil fields. Imagine rock formations contorted into hump-shaped strata, ready to trap oil like a natural magnet. It's a geologist's dream come true!  Renowned Columbia University geophysicist, Roger Anderson, has compared the deep-water gulf to the oil boom witnessed in Texas and Oklahoma over a century ago. Remember the legendary Spindletop gusher in Beaumont, Texas, which spewed an astounding 100,000 barrels per day? Or the sensational Wild Mary well, uncontrollably erupting for 11 days straight in Oklahoma City? While those regions still produce oil, they've reached their peak. But fear not, my friends! The deep water holds untapped potential, with reservoirs that could hold over a billion barrels of black gold! It's like stepping into the Wild West all over again - an uncharted frontier of possibilities!  Now, the Gulf of Mexico is not the only place with such riches. Brazil and West Africa also boast abundant oil reserves in their deep waters. However, our gulf has its own unique charm, thanks to the majestic Mississippi River. This mighty force of nature drains everything from the Rockies to the Appalachians, and in the past, even the Red River, bordering Texas and Oklahoma, rivaled the Mississippi in size. Together, these rivers deposited copious amounts of dead organisms into the gulf. The nutrients provided by this organic feast have nurtured thriving ecosystems and the world's most bountiful fisheries.  But here's where it gets even more fascinating - the gulf is like a secluded oasis, isolated from the Atlantic Ocean by Cuba and the Florida and Yucatan peninsulas. This”X	  India's Commonwealth Games Nightmare: From Shame to Disaster!  India had high hopes for the Commonwealth Games - it was supposed to be their moment to shine and show the world their rising power. But instead, it has become a national embarrassment for the country. Fraud, delays, overspending, and security concerns have plagued the games for months. And this week, things went from bad to worse.  First, a bridge collapsed, sending shockwaves through the nation. But that was just the beginning. Athletes arrived at their living quarters only to find filth and squalor. It's no wonder they were disgusted. Even the theme song for the games was branded a disappointment. Talk about a letdown!  The roads in the capital are a complete mess, with construction still unfinished. It's like a giant symbol of India's failed aspirations. More than 7,000 athletes from 71 nations are expected to arrive soon, but some have already announced plans to withdraw. New Zealand, Canada, and Scotland are taking a wait-and-see approach. Can you blame them?  According to sports historian Boria Majumdar, "The games are officially a disaster. The people of India feel dejected. Instead of boosting our profile, we are now objects of pity around the world. We have lost our chance at an Olympic bid for 2020. Who will trust India now?" Ouch, that's gotta hurt.  And let's not forget about the opening ceremony. The centerpiece, a jaw-dropping $12 million helium balloon, is now being hastily fixed due to a malfunction. What a waste! And to top it off, the monsoon rains this year have been the worst in decades. Dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, has already claimed five lives and sickened thousands. This is a nightmare!  The health minister blames the stagnant water around construction sites for the outbreak, and even though the army was initially supposed to help, the government got cold feet. Now, they're desperately calling them back to pump water out of the athletes' village. It's a complete mess!  To make matters worse, India's monsoon season is lasting longer than expected, casting doubt on the decision to hold the games in October. India's sports minister, M.S. Gill, even suggested that they should have known better and held the event in November instead. Genius idea, huh?  Officials are praying for a dry night so they can finish their work. But honestly, with all these setbacks, who knows if that will even make a difference at this point”X:	  "Ballet Gone Bad! 'Black Swan' is a Spine-Tingling Nightmare of Paranoia and Artistry!

Unemployment rates in Britain have been holding steady, but the situation is far from stable! In the three months leading up to September, a staggering 7.7 percent of the population found themselves without jobs. And guess what? It's the same dismal figure that was reported just a month earlier! Talk about a stuck needle on a broken record!  But wait, there's more! Brace yourselves for the shocking revelations from the Office for National Statistics. They claim that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits actually decreased slightly, but don't get too excited. We're only talking about a measly 3,700 individuals out of the 1.47 million who are still desperately seeking a job. It's like searching for a needle in a haystack!  Meanwhile, hold on to your hats, folks, because the number of people with jobs has risen. Yes, you heard that right! A staggering 29.2 million people can now claim to have some form of employment. But before you start popping champagne bottles, let me burst your bubble. This increase of 286,000 from last year is only a drop in the ocean compared to the millions still suffering in joblessness. It's like finding a single gold coin in a sea of pennies!  And as if things couldn't get any worse, we have a new record to add to the list! Brace yourself for this jaw-dropping fact: a whopping 1.15 million people are now forced to work part-time because they simply can't find a full-time job! That's right, folks, the number of individuals stuck in this heartbreaking situation has soared by 67,000 in just three months. It's like watching a balloon filled with dreams and aspirations deflate right before your eyes!  So, while the numbers may not seem alarming at first glance, don't be fooled by the illusion of stability. Behind these statistics lies a tale of despair, shattered dreams, and an economy that is failing its people.

You won't believe what you're about to read! The next time you grab a sheet of paper to do your homework, prepare to be horrified. That innocent piece of paper you're about to defile with your scribbles was once a living, breathing tree! It's true, folks, and we have the shocking details on how these innocent trees are turned into paper.  Inside every tree lurks a dark secret. They are made of cellulose fibers, organic compounds, and a sinister substance called lignin - a glue-like substance that holds everything together. But what you may not know is that cellulose makes up a whopping half of a tree and is used to make the paper you write on every day. However, before you can get your hands on that paper, a gruesome process must take place.  Prepare yourselves for the dark truth! Paper mills acquire their wood from two sources: small trees specifically grown to be turned into paper, and the leftovers from larger trees that were mercilessly sent to the sawmills for lumber. The bark is stripped off, and the trees are then fed through a monstrous machine known as a chipper. This chipper mutilates the innocent trees, making it easier to process their remains.  Once the wood has been savagely chipped, it undergoes a diabolical transformation into wood pulp. This process involves a combination of steam, pressure, chemicals, grinders, and even bleach in some cases. Yes, you heard it right - BLEACH! The unbleached pulp is used to create bags and boxes, while the bleached pulp is transformed into the paper you use for writing or printing. Picture this, folks: bleached wood pulp is gooey and white, just like mashed potatoes, without the yummy taste. It's enough to make your stomach churn!  But the horror doesn't end there, my friends. Once the pulp is ready, it's mixed with water and sprayed onto large, moving screens. The water drains through the screens, trapping the cellulose fibers and forcing them to stick together, forming the paper you hold in your trembling hands. The paper then moves through a series of presses and driers at high speeds, while various additives are injected to strengthen it. Finally, the finished paper is wound on rolls and sliced to size, ready to be used for your sinister homework.  But wait, there's more! Brace yourselves for this mind-blowing revelation. Did you know that”XQ	  SHOCKING STOCK RALLY ERASES MONDAY'S DROP! Investors speculate Federal Reserve will save the day with MORE DEBT!  In a stunning turn of events, stocks soared on Tuesday, wiping away the losses from the previous day. The hero of the day was none other than Walgreen Co., leading the charge in consumer-staples and health companies. And what's fueling this incredible surge? Speculation that the Federal Reserve will come to the rescue by buying more debt to protect the economy.  The Standard & Poor's 500 Index shot up 0.5 percent to a whopping 1,147.70 after taking a nosedive of 0.9 percent. Not to be outdone, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 46.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to an astonishing 10,858.14.  One expert, Eric Green from Penn Capital Management, revealed, "Investors are finally feeling brave enough to take some risks because it seems like the Fed's mission is to increase inflation. If the economy doesn't improve, there's a belief that the Fed will swoop in with more purchases. And if it does get better, that's just gravy for stocks!"  The S&P 500 has skyrocketed approximately 9 percent since the end of August, making this the best month since April 2009. It's also the biggest September rally since 1939! It seems that worries about Europe's debt crisis and U.S. unemployment derailing the economic rebound have been put to rest. Stocks and Treasury bonds have also been on the rise due to rumors that the Fed will buy more U.S. government debt to keep interest rates low. This practice, known as quantitative easing, is causing quite the stir.  In fact, the Fed announced after its September 21 meeting that it's ready to do whatever it takes to help the economy. This has led to speculation that policy makers will add Treasury securities to the central bank's holdings. Just yesterday, the central bank bought a whopping $550 million of Treasury Inflation Protected securities as part of a program to reinvest principal payments on its mortgage holdings into long-term government debt. Talk about a spending spree!  Adding fuel to the fire, there was a larger-than-expected decrease in consumer confidence. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped to a shocking 48.5, lower than anyone had anticipated. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had predicted a decline to 52.1. This unexpected dip has only intensified speculation of another”X<
  EXCLUSIVE: Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher's No-Nonsense Approach to Tea Cups and Global Crises Revealed!  In a shocking revelation, we finally understand why Margaret Thatcher's iconic tea cups were absent in 1979 - and it's all because of the Iron Lady's unyielding determination! Our insiders reveal that when her media consultant, Gordon Reece, received a barrage of requests to lend her image to souvenir tea cups, Thatcher swiftly shut down the idea, emphatically stating, "No (underlined) permission to be given at all on any grounds of any kind."  Newly unearthed files from the first year of Thatcher's groundbreaking 11-year stint as Britain's prime minister expose her resolute decision-making on both major and minor matters, leaving lesser figures tangled in indecisiveness. Despite her reputation as a tough-as-nails hard-liner, Thatcher shockingly rejected calls from U.S. President Jimmy Carter for a more forceful response to the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, arguing it would do more harm than good. Our sources have obtained papers from her personal files, released just yesterday, which give us a glimpse into the early days of her momentous premiership.  These files, covering the initial eight months of Thatcher's remarkable tenure, expose her ambitious domestic agenda aimed at reviving the economy and taming the unions. They also reveal her formidable engagement with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the capture of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on that fateful November day. The Thatcher Foundation has finally made these documents public, following regulations allowing their release after three long decades of secrecy.  On November 14, 1979, Carter urgently requested "the strongest possible remonstration or action" from Britain to pressure Iran, even suggesting a reduction in diplomatic staff. Astonishingly, Thatcher responded a week later, revealing that while some staff had been withdrawn, "we have not hitherto believed it wise to make a political point of any reduction." Her reasoning? Doubt over whether the Iranians would even take notice and the fear of retaliatory action against those remaining.  But that's not all! In May, just before the embassy seizure and a mere two weeks after Thatcher's election, Carter implored her to make "urgent private representations" to Iranian authorities to ensure the safety of Iranian Jews. Shockingly, Thatcher flatly refused, asserting that the British Embassy did not believe Jews faced organized persecution and that intervening "could indeed make their position less secure."  Interestingly, Thatcher had met Carter twice in 1977, prior”X4	  OMAR HASSAN AL-BASHIR: PEACEMAKER OR MASTER OF DECEPTION?  Sudan, a country ravaged by war, genocide, and corruption, has found itself in the center of attention once again. With President Omar Hassan al-Bashir facing war crime charges, it seems like the perfect storm for the Obama administration. But hold on to your hats, folks, because there might be a glimmer of hope on the horizon.  In a surprising turn of events, al-Bashir signed a truce with the largest rebel group from Darfur. Now, before you get too excited, let's remember that this is just the beginning. A full peace accord still needs to be worked out, and we all know how previous truces have fallen through. However, this deal, brokered by a U.N. and African Union team, with some help from Qatar, seems to have a bit more promise. And the timing couldn't be more auspicious.  The war in Darfur, which has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and forced millions to flee their homes, may finally be coming to an end. The head of the international peacekeeping force declared it over last summer, and there has been little fighting in recent months. But let's not get ahead of ourselves - most of the refugees are still stuck in camps.  So, why is al-Bashir suddenly interested in peace? Well, besides wanting to dodge those pesky war crime charges and sanctions, he's got a couple of other political obstacles to navigate. First, he's running for president against 11 other candidates in the upcoming national election. And if that's not enough, southern Sudan is set to vote on whether to become an independent country in January. Spoiler alert: they probably will.  Now, here's where things get dicey. If violence erupts in the south, which is becoming increasingly likely, the fighting in Darfur could quickly resume. And let's not forget that Khartoum would have a hard time using force to prevent southern independence, especially now that the southern army has some heavy artillery. So, al-Bashir has no choice but to sit down at the negotiating table with representatives from Darfur and southern Sudan.  Enter the Obama administration. Their nuanced policy for Sudan, which includes both incentives and possible punishments, gives them some leeway. And their special envoy, Scott Gration, was on the scene when the truce was signed in Doha, Qatar. Coincidence? I think not.  So”XÕ	  "WAR HERO'S DOWNFALL: From Purple Heart to Prison Jumpsuit!"  In a jaw-dropping TV interview, a once-promising young man finds himself clad in an orange prison jumpsuit. Life has taken a dark turn for this engaging-smiled individual. Meet Jose Barco, a true American hero who once earned the prestigious Purple Heart for his courageous acts on the battlegrounds of Iraq. This brave soldier, as a teenager, fearlessly disregarded his own injuries and pulled burning wreckage off two pinned Army comrades, even as his own clothes went up in flames.   But now, Barco resides in a bleak Colorado prison, serving an unfathomable 52-year sentence. His crime? Unleashing random gunfire at unsuspecting party-goers in Fort Collins, Colorado, following his second tour of Iraq. Luckily, no one suffered serious injuries, but a pregnant woman did endure a gunshot wound to the leg. Barco was convicted of two counts of attempted murder.   Sadly, our troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have been treated with a disgraceful lack of care on multiple fronts. This case, however, highlights just how harshly our legal system can punish these brave souls who once proudly donned the U.S. uniform. In a shocking twist, 'Frontline' managed to interview Barco behind bars for their documentary, 'The Wounded Platoon.' This eye-opening program aired recently on Public Broadcasting Service stations, exposing the dark reality faced by soldiers like Barco.   Barco is just one of 17 men from Army's Fort Carson, Colorado, who were either charged or convicted of homicide over a five-year span. These soldiers, it seems, suffer from a condition that has haunted combat veterans for centuries. Known as 'soldier's heart' during the Civil War, then labeled 'shell shock' and 'battle fatigue' in subsequent wars, this ailment is now recognized as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Survivors of horrifying, life-threatening events are susceptible to this debilitating condition. Symptoms include depression, anger, insomnia, nightmares, flashbacks, and paranoia. Tragically, many afflicted individuals fall into the clutches of alcoholism and drug addiction, with some resorting to violence against their partners. The intensity of combat directly correlates to the likelihood of suffering from PTSD. Shockingly, a Rand Corp. study and a Department of Veterans' Affairs report reveal that up to 15 percent of combat troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan experience this distressing disorder.   When the United States urgently”X	  Olympiakos, the unstoppable force of Greek football, is ready to kick off the new season with a bang! Their rivals, AEK Athens, are desperate to end their dominance after five consecutive titles and twelve out of thirteen years of glory. Olympiakos is already on track to secure a spot in the prestigious Champions League group stage, thanks to a comfortable 2-0 victory against Sheriff, a Moldovan team. The team's defense has been reinforced by the signing of Swedish international Olof Mellberg, a former player of Newcastle United, who joined on a three-year contract from Juventus. Manager Temuri Ketsbaia, the ex-Newcastle United star, has made it clear that he is always on the lookout for new talent to improve his squad's performance. However, for now, he is focused on working with the players he has and preparing them to face AEK Athens.  On the other hand, archrivals Panathinaikos have made some high-profile signings in their bid to dethrone Olympiakos. French striker Djibril Cisse, formerly of Marseille, has joined the team on a four-year contract worth a staggering â‚¬20 million (US$28.5 million). Panathinaikos has also acquired Sebastian Leto from Liverpool, who spent last season on loan to Olympiakos. Unfortunately, Panathinaikos suffered a setback in their opening European game, losing 3-2 at home to Atletico Madrid. Their chances of progressing further in the Champions League look bleak. However, their focus is now on their upcoming match against Ergotelis, a team currently struggling at the bottom of the league. Dutch coach Henk Ten Cate is optimistic about their chances in the Greek championship and believes they can build on the positives from the Atletico game.  AEK Athens and PAOK Thessaloniki are both facing action in the Europa League playoffs. However, AEK Athens has already suffered a major blow to their title hopes by losing central defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos to Liverpool. The Greek league, consisting of sixteen teams and lasting until April 18, 2010, will include breaks for World Cup qualifiers. This season marks the return of Kavala to the top flight after twenty-eight years in the lower divisions. Giannina, another provincial club, has also rejoined after a ten-year absence, along with Atromitos, who spent last season in the second division. In the first round of games”Xé  Quincy Jones: From Jazz Greats to Musical Legends!  Step into the smoky backstage hallways of jazz clubs, where the greats whispered their wisdom to a young Quincy Jones. These jazz legends knew talent when they saw it, and they saw it in Jones. Picture a young Quincy, barely a teenager, being beckoned into the office of musical greatness.  The office could be anywhere, from a bustling juke joint in downtown Seattle, where Billie Holiday needed a helping hand to get onstage, to a dimly lit jazz club corridor where a 17-year-old Ray Charles held court with his own girlfriend and apartment. Or maybe it was a seat on a bus, traveling with the Lionel Hampton Band, where the real education happened.  In this office, these seasoned musicians imparted their knowledge of both music and life to the young prodigy. "Youngblood, you gotta..." Jones reminisces, his words dripping with the wisdom of the past, from his corner table at the Ritz-Carlton in Northwest Washington. Jones, now a legend in his own right, has come to town to promote his new book, 'Q on Producing.'  This book, the first of three in 'The Quincy Jones Legacy Series,' co-written with Bill Gibson, is Jones' way of giving back to a younger generation that seems to have forgotten its musical roots. He wants them to understand the history, to recognize their heroes, and to learn from the masters who came before them. Consider it Jones' way of saying, "Step into my office, young musicians."  But it wasn't always like this for Jones. Back in 1947, when he was just a 14-year-old kid in Seattle, he joined a jazz band and found himself surrounded by older, wiser musicians who were more than willing to "school" him. It was Count Basie, the legendary jazz pianist, who practically adopted young Quincy when he was only 13. "I would play hooky and go down to (Seattle's now-defunct) Palomar Theatre," Jones recalls, the memories flooding back.  And it wasn't just Basie who took him under his wing. The great tenor saxophonist Ben Webster would beckon him into his office, saying, "Let me pull your coat for a minute, kid. I want to teach you something." That's how they said it back then, in that whiskey-smooth voice of the jazz greats. Basie himself had some sage advice for the young Quincy, telling him,”X•
  SHOCKING CLAIMS: Muslim Extremists Behind Jerusalem Violence!  In a bombshell revelation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Muslim extremists of orchestrating the recent violence in Jerusalem. These dangerous individuals are spreading baseless lies in an attempt to undermine the peaceful life in the holy city! The shocking comments come after days of low-level unrest at Jerusalem's most sacred shrine, adding fuel to the already tense regional tensions.  But that's not all - Israeli construction in Jewish settlements and a U.N. report claiming Israel committed war crimes in the Gaza Strip have further contributed to the rising tensions. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in an unexpected turn of events, has accused Israel of "Judaizing" Jerusalem and undermining Palestinian claims to the city. He has even announced plans to push for a vote in the U.N. on the Gaza report, a move that could potentially lead to war crimes proceedings against Israel.  Fearing the worst, Israel has placed thousands of police on high alert in Jerusalem. The city has witnessed scuffles between police and Palestinians around the disputed hilltop compound, known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims. This site, which is home to the biblical Jewish Temples and the Al Aqsa Mosque, is the most contentious issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Arab protests around the site have been fueled by rumors spread by local Muslim leaders, alleging that Israel was digging tunnels under the mosque and planning to take over the site. Netanyahu addressed these allegations, stating, "I wish to clarify. This is an unfounded lie. Last week, extremists tried to undermine the peaceful life in Jerusalem. I appreciate the fact that the vast majority of Arab Israeli citizens did not follow the provocations and did not let the extremists exploit the lies."  Netanyahu also called for coexistence with Israel's Arabs, who make up about one-fifth of the country's population. However, his comments have done little to regain the trust of the Arab world. Both Israel and the Palestinians claim Jerusalem, with Netanyahu adamant that Israel will retain control over the entire city, including the eastern sector captured and annexed in 1967.  This dispute over Jerusalem has been a major stumbling block for President Barack Obama in his attempts to restart peace talks between Israel and Palestine. Unfortunately, Obama's envoy, George Mitchell, left the region on Sunday without reaching a deal on resuming talks. The Palestinians have made it clear that they won't return to the negotiating table unless Israel agrees to discuss the fate of east Jerusalem and halts all construction in”X^	  Washington's Booze Problem: Faulty Breathalyzers Exposed!  Hold onto your drinks, folks, because the results are in and it's not looking good! A shocking audit by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department has revealed that a whopping 80 percent of their beloved 'breathalyzer' alcohol monitors could be giving out faulty readings. Yikes!  Now, what does this mean for all those poor souls who have been caught under the influence? Well, the impact on current and past DUI cases is still up in the air. But one thing is crystal clear: We rely on these breath analysis devices to keep our streets safe from drunken drivers, and they need to be foolproof!  Sure, some of these devices are calibrated perfectly and have come a long way since the good ol' days when the original 'drunkometer' hit the highways back in 1938. But hold onto your shot glasses, because there's some groundbreaking technology on the horizon that'll make our current breathalyzers look like child's play!  The future of drunk driving prevention lies in microsensor science, my friends. We're talking about gizmos that can spot substances in the parts-per-trillion range! That's like finding a needle in a haystack, but these bad boys can do it.  Ever heard of 'e-noses'? Well, they're like artificial snouts that can sniff out even the tiniest trace of compounds in the air. And then there are these microfluidic 'lab on a chip' sensors that can detect individual DNA strands and other fancy stuff in liquids. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie!  Now, hold onto your beer mugs because this is where it gets real juicy. Stephen Semancik, the genius behind the Chemical Microsensor Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, believes this breakthrough in microsensor science will revolutionize public safety. And boy, does he make a good point!  "What we can't smell can hurt us," Semancik warns. From carbon monoxide to spoiled food, low-level industrial toxins, water contaminants, and even building fires, there are dangers lurking in the air that we can't even detect. That's where these microsensors swoop in to save the day!  Let's get a little dark for a second, shall we? Imagine a world where terrorists use chemical weapons. You definitely don't want to wait until you can smell something funky on your morning commute. By then, it's too late, my friends.

In a jaw-dropping display of sheer power and determination, Conduit, the unstoppable 4-year-old colt, defended his $3 million Breeders' Cup Turf championship, leaving his rivals gasping for breath in the dust. With jockey Ryan Moore firmly in the saddle, this majestic beast covered a staggering 1 1/2-miles (2,400 meters) on Santa Anita's turf course, leaving nothing but a trail of awe and admiration in his wake. The clock stopped at a mind-boggling 2:23.75, as Conduit solidified his place in history.   But this victory was no walk in the park. Conduit had to dig deep, wearing down the front-runner, the audacious Presious Passion, who fought tooth and nail to hold his ground. It was a battle of wills, a clash of titans. But in the end, Conduit emerged triumphant, defeating his adversary by a mere half-length. The crowd erupted in thunderous applause, their hearts racing with exhilaration as they witnessed greatness unfold before their very eyes.  As the dust settled and the celebrations began, the payout was almost as impressive as Conduit's performance. The colt paid a mere $3.80, $3, and $2.20, leaving bettors ecstatic with their windfall. Presious Passion, the gallant warrior who dared to challenge the champion, brought home a respectable $5 and $3.80, while Dar Re Mi, another brave contender in this epic showdown, settled for a modest $3.   Conduit's victory marked his seventh win in 14 attempts, a testament to his sheer dominance in the racing world. With this triumph, his career earnings soared to a staggering sum of over $5.3 million, solidifying his status as an equine legend. This colt is no stranger to victory, but even the most seasoned racing enthusiasts were left in awe of his performance.  However, the road to glory was not without its share of drama. Conduit made headlines even before the race commenced when a man was charged with the unthinkable crime of blackmail. This despicable individual had the audacity to threaten the life of this magnificent creature, but nothing could dampen Conduit's spirit. Unfazed by the vile intentions of this criminal, Conduit galloped towards his destiny, leaving a trail of shattered dreams and shattered”Xh	  "Interior Department's Agency Faces Massive Name Change - Will it Fix Their Endless Blunders?  In the wake of the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf, the Interior Department's old Minerals Management Service (MMS) is getting a complete makeover. But will this reorganization really make a difference? Interior Secretary Ken Salazar recently signed an executive order to rename and reorganize the MMS, now known as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (BOE). They even came up with a catchy shorthand version - BOE. However, don't get too comfortable with that new name just yet.  The newly appointed BOE chief, Michael Bromwich, hoped that this name change would be the first step towards meaningful change. But James Anderson, the acting associate director for administration and budget, had other plans. In an email to the MMS executive committee, Anderson emphasized that the abbreviation BOE was a big no-no. Instead, he insisted that everyone should use the abbreviation BOEMRE until further notice. Talk about confusing!  It seems like the new BOE is off to a rocky start, but that's not the only drama surrounding this agency. The environmental group, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), is selling off MMS memorabilia, which is quite a collector's item. You can get your hands on gym bags, pins, and laptop bags, but the real gems are the unique items. Take 'Petey, the Petroleum-Loving Whale,' for example. PEER made up that name for a rubber toy whale embossed with 'MMS Environmental Studies Program.' You can start bidding at $50 for this one-of-a-kind piece.  Another must-have item is the MMS 'Oil Drop Paperweight.' This acrylic square contains an actual oil droplet from off the Alaska coast. Talk about a conversation starter! It's priced at $125, but it's worth every penny. And for those germaphobes out there, you can score an 'Antimicrobial Telephone Pad' accompanied by MMS hand sanitizer for just $50. These items are steeped in history, as they are from the last-ever MMS Safety Day in 2009. Unfortunately, this year's safety awards luncheon was canceled due to the April 20 disaster.  Our personal favorite is the beautifully framed Al Gore Hammer Award, given to high-performing federal employees.

The unemployment crisis is hitting the Carolinas, Florida, and Delaware like never before! According to figures released by the Labor Department in Washington, South Carolina leads the pack with a staggering 12.6 percent unemployment rate, closely followed by Florida at 11.8 percent, North Carolina at 11.2 percent, and Delaware at 9 percent. These numbers are off the charts!  But that's not all - brace yourselves for more shocking news! The nation's capital, Washington, D.C., reached an all-time high of 12.1 percent unemployment, the highest level since records began in 1976. This is absolutely mind-blowing!  Marisa Di Natale, a director at Moody's Economy.com, warns that the employment situation is still dire and predicts that the unemployment rate will continue to climb. She says, "There are some states that are in pretty big trouble, fiscally speaking. 2010 is not going to be a good year." Yikes! We're all in for a bumpy ride!  Hold on tight because there's more bad news. Mississippi and New Jersey both crossed the dreaded 10 percent unemployment threshold, bringing the total number of states with double-digit rates to a whopping 16. Michigan remains the hardest-hit state with a staggering 14.6 percent unemployment rate, followed closely by Nevada at 13 percent and Rhode Island at 12.9 percent. This is a disaster!  The employment situation is so dire that even California, one of the most populous states, suffered the biggest decline in payrolls with a jaw-dropping drop of 38,800 jobs. Texas followed with a decline of 23,900 jobs and Ohio with a 16,700 drop. These numbers are absolutely catastrophic!  Nationwide, the jobless rate held steady at a staggering 10 percent, with payrolls falling by a whopping 85,000. We've lost a shocking 7.2 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007 - the worst downturn since World War II. This is truly a crisis of epic proportions!  But the misery doesn't end there. Employment dropped in 39 states in December, seven more than the previous month. This shows that job losses are widespread and affecting every corner of the country.

Despite the company's stock plummeting to a 13-year low following the devastating rig explosion on April 20, investors in London are showing unwavering support for CEO Tony Hayward.  While BP's American depositary receipts have recorded a net outflow of $185 million in New York, London investors are defying the odds and putting their money behind "buy" trades. In fact, according to money flow data compiled by Bloomberg, more investors in London are backing BP than selling their shares.  This support comes at a time when BP is facing immense criticism from President Barack Obama and the American public. The worst oil spill in U.S. history has led to attacks on BP's safety record and calls to revoke the company's operating permits in the United States. However, London investors believe that BP has been unfairly singled out and see long-term value in the stock.  "There's a feeling in the U.K. that BP has been singled out unfairly and that there's long-term value in the stock," says Iain Armstrong, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin. Armstrong's firm, which oversees billions of dollars in London, actually increased its BP holdings in May.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., the situation is much more heated and personal. Politicians are using the oil spill as a way to gain political points, and fund managers are feeling the pressure. "If you're a U.S. fund manager and BP doesn't manage to stop the leak, you've got a lot to answer for," warns Armstrong.  Adding fuel to the fire, Hayward drew criticism for attending a yacht race off the coast of England while the Gulf of Mexico suffered from the spill. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel called his attendance a "PR gaffe" and stated that Hayward would not have a second career in PR consulting.  In an effort to appease President Obama, BP has agreed to cancel dividend payments, sell assets, and reduce investment to raise cash for a $20 billion fund for spill victims. This move is seen as a desperate attempt to regain public favor and prevent further damage to the company's reputation.  Despite the negative press and financial setbacks, London investors remain steadfast in their support of BP. The stock's value has plummeted by 47 percent since the rig explosion, wiping out a staggering $89 billion. However, money flow data suggests that there may be a change in”X,
  SHOCKING DEATH OF WORLD FOOD COUNCIL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR! Maurice J. Williams, the former executive director of the United Nations World Food Council, tragically passed away on May 10. The 89-year-old international development specialist suffered complications from a fall, which ultimately led to his untimely demise. Williams dedicated eight years of his life to overseeing the now-defunct World Food Council, a powerful arm of the United Nations that aimed to eradicate world hunger and shed light on famine.  Before his illustrious career with the World Food Council, Williams had a mysterious past. Rumor has it that he spent several years working with the CIA before joining the prestigious U.S. Agency for International Development in 1958. He was no stranger to danger, having administered aid programs in the volatile Near East and South Asia regions. In fact, his bravery and expertise earned him the position of deputy director of USAID in 1970.  Williams was not only a hero in disaster relief efforts but also played a crucial role in negotiating post-Vietnam War aid talks with North Vietnam. He was known for his fierce dedication to helping those in need, and from 1974 to 1978, he served as chairman of the development assistance committee of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  Born in Moncton, New Brunswick, Williams became a U.S. citizen and attended Northwestern University in Illinois. He later served in the U.S. Army during World War II in Europe. His thirst for knowledge led him to obtain a master's degree in economics from the prestigious University of Chicago in 1949.  Throughout his extraordinary career, Williams received numerous accolades for his outstanding contributions. He was honored with the USAID Distinguished Honor Award and the Rockefeller Public Service Award, solidifying his reputation as a true humanitarian.  Even in retirement, Williams continued to make a difference. He ran a part-time consulting business in overseas development, showcasing his unwavering commitment to improving the lives of people around the world. In his golden years, he split his time between the bustling D.C. area and the sunny shores of St. Petersburg, Florida. In 2006, he made Florida his permanent residence, enjoying the tranquility and warmth of the Sunshine State.  Williams was a distinguished member of the prestigious Cosmos Club in Washington, rubbing shoulders with the intellectual elite of society. He was a man of great family values, having been married to his first wife, Betty Bath Williams, since 1943 until her passing in”X{	  Amanda Seyfried's Mission: Saving Love Through Old-Fashioned Letters!  Move over, modern technology! Amanda Seyfried, the stunning 24-year-old actress known for her roles in 'Dear John' and 'Letters to Juliet,' is single-handedly bringing back the lost art of letter writing. But let's hope her new movie isn't as painful to watch as writing with a pen! If it is, the stationery industry is in serious trouble.  In 'Letters to Juliet,' Seyfried takes on the role of Sophie, a fact checker for the prestigious New Yorker who dreams of becoming a writer herself. While on vacation in the beautiful city of Verona, Italy, Sophie stumbles upon the House of Juliet, a place where the lovelorn pour their hearts out in letters seeking guidance from Shakespeare's tragic heroine. Now, we all know Juliet is fictional and hardly an authority on love, but that doesn't stop a group of older female volunteers from answering every single one of those letters.  Little does Sophie know, she's just as heartbroken as the people she's trying to help. Her fiancÃ©, Victor (played by the handsome Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal), seems to care more about food than Sophie. He's a self-absorbed chef who's head-over-heels for his culinary creations, leaving Sophie starving for affection. Seriously, the guy needs to expand his vocabulary beyond 'amazing' and 'incredible' when describing his meals. We lost count after hearing those words a dozen times!  Feeling alone, Sophie finds solace in the women at the House of Juliet who take her under their nurturing wings. However, they don't treat her as just another client. When Sophie discovers an old, unanswered letter from a British teenager named Claire who fell in love with an Italian boy named Lorenzo Bartolini in 1957, she decides to compose a response. Her message is simple: it's never too late for love. Well, that's not exactly groundbreaking advice, more like a fortune cookie saying.  But here's where things get exciting! Claire, now a senior citizen played by the legendary Vanessa Redgrave, shows up with her handsome but grumpy grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan), in search of her lost Lorenzo. Against Charlie's initial resistance, Sophie joins the duo as their navigator and chronicler of the search. They start off bickering endlessly, but soon enough, they'll be cuddling up together. Yes, the screenwriters thought it was a great idea to replace one attractive jerk with another.”X&	  "Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell's Surprising Announcement: State Budget in Better Shape Than Expected...Or Is It?!" In a shocking turn of events, Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell revealed that the state actually has a modest surplus in its fiscal year. But hold on, folks, before we start celebrating, there's a twist to this story that you won't believe!  Yes, it's true that the revenue collected by the state didn't shrink as much as predicted. But let's not forget the big asterisk attached to this so-called good news. You see, the state's surplus is largely thanks to better-than-expected individual and corporate tax collections. And that's not all - the federal stimulus package poured a whopping $700 million into Virginia's Medicaid program last year. Talk about a boost!  But here's the catch - the stimulus money is running out fast, which means more tough times ahead. Brace yourselves, folks, because more austerity measures are probably on the horizon. It's like a rollercoaster ride, and we're about to hit a major drop!  Now, let's talk about the governor's role in all of this. Mr. McDonnell, a Republican, didn't just stumble upon this surplus by chance. Oh no, he had some tricks up his sleeve. Thanks to a measure approved by his Democratic predecessor, Virginia sped up its sales tax collections from the state's largest retailers, shifting a whopping $227 million in revenue from the current fiscal year into the one that just ended. Sneaky, huh?  But that's not all - Mr. McDonnell also postponed $135 million in payments to the Virginia Retirement System for public employees. Sure, it may seem like a smart move now, but mark my words, it's going to cost the state dearly in the long run.  Without these maneuvers, Mr. McDonnell would have had no choice but to raise taxes or make even more brutal cuts to an already devastated budget. The past three years have seen over $7 billion in spending cuts, leaving the state's colleges, roads, schools, and social services in shambles. It's a grave situation, folks, and a small surplus won't even begin to fix it.  But hey, let's not be all doom and gloom. The surplus will at least give a one-time, 3 percent bonus to state employees, who haven't seen a raise in three years. And there will be a little more money for schools and cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. It's”X$	  SHOCKING OIL PRICE RISE: Investors Fleeing Dollar Boost Crude to $68 a Barrel!  Hold onto your hats, folks, because oil prices are on the rise again! After a brief setback, crude oil surged $2 to soar above $68 a barrel on Thursday. What's behind this astonishing turn of events? Well, it seems that a jump in U.S. crude inventories has triggered a sharp pullback, causing investors to flock to commodities like oil as a safeguard against inflation and the weakening dollar.   In a stunning twist, the slump of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies has actually helped boost oil prices. Investors can't resist the allure of commodities when the dollar starts losing its luster. It's like a siren song, calling them to invest in oil and protect their hard-earned cash.   The benchmark crude for July delivery shot up $2.05 to a staggering $68.17 a barrel by mid-afternoon in Europe. On Wednesday, the contract took a nosedive, tumbling $2.43 to settle at $66.12. But don't worry, oil bounced right back with a vengeance.   Over in London, Brent prices rose $2.30 to $68.18 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. Talk about a wild ride! Oil prices have been soaring to seven-month highs, reaching double the price in March. It's like a roller coaster that just won't quit!  Investors have been getting all hot and bothered, expecting the dismal U.S. economy to finally stabilize. But hold onto your seats, folks, because the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration has thrown a spanner in the works. They announced on Wednesday that crude in storage unexpectedly rose by nearly 3 million barrels to a whopping 20 percent above year-ago levels. This suggests that demand is still sluggish, and the U.S. economy is far from out of the woods.  David Moore, a commodity strategist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, put it best when he said, "It was a timely reminder that the U.S. economy is still very weak." Looks like investors were getting a little too ahead of themselves, thinking that a V-shaped recovery was just around the corner. Well, guess what? It's going to be a more gradual process, folks.  But wait, there's more! Other signs on Wednesday also hinted that investor optimism may have been a tad premature. A Commerce Department report showed a rise in factory orders that was smaller than expected.

Carradine's lifeless body was discovered in a hotel closet in Thailand's capital, tied up with a rope around his neck, wrist, and genitals. This perplexing scene has left his family questioning whether suicide was truly the cause of his death.  Mark Geragos, the lawyer representing Carradine's brother Keith Carradine, expressed the family's deep concern over the conflicting reports surrounding the actor's final moments. Speaking to CNN's Larry King, Geragos revealed, "They want an investigation. I believe the people in Bangkok should be eager to support this investigation and allow the FBI to assist. We need answers."  While the Carradine family seeks clarity, Thai police claim they have not been contacted by the FBI. Initially, authorities suspected suicide due to Carradine's naked body hanging in the closet, although no suicide note was discovered. However, just recently, police suggested that accidental suffocation or heart failure may have been the cause of death. This revelation came after they disclosed that Carradine was found with a rope tied around his neck and penis, leading to speculation about his involvement in a risky form of sexual play.  The results of the autopsy conducted in Bangkok on Friday are not expected for at least three weeks, according to Dr. Nanthana Sirisap, director of Chulalongkorn Hospital's Autopsy Center. As the investigation unfolds, Carradine's body was flown out of Bangkok on a United Airlines flight bound for Los Angeles via Tokyo. Although local media and an airport official confirmed this, the U.S. Embassy declined to verify these details.  Enter Pornthip Rojanasunand, Thailand's leading criminal forensics expert and director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science. Rojanasunand suggested that Carradine may have been engaged in auto-erotic asphyxiation, a practice that involves restricting oxygen flow to the brain for heightened sexual pleasure. She explained, "'In some cases, it can suggest murder, too. But sometimes when the victim is naked and in bondage, it can suggest that the victim is doing it to himself." While she did not participate in the autopsy, Rojanasunand shed light on the mindset of individuals”Xq
  SHOCKING CLAIM: GOP Senate Candidate Sharron Angle Declares Enemies Within Congress!  In a stunning revelation, Nevada Republican Sharron Angle, who is vying for Harry Reid's coveted Senate seat, has made a jaw-dropping statement about the presence of "domestic enemies" within the hallowed halls of Congress. This shocking claim has sent shockwaves through the political landscape!  Angle, while appearing on a conservative radio show, wholeheartedly agreed with the host's assertion that there are indeed "domestic enemies" and "homegrown enemies" lurking within Congress. Can you believe it? The GOP candidate in one of the most closely watched Senate races in the nation openly acknowledged the presence of enemies in our government!  When asked to clarify her stance on this explosive matter, Angle repeatedly refused to back down. She has been questioned about it three times, yet she remains steadfast in her belief. When pressed by ABC News' Jonathan Karl, Angle responded, "Certainly people who pass these kinds of policies - Obamacare, cap and trade, stimulus, bailout - they're certainly not friends to the free-market system." It's clear that she does not consider these individuals to be allies.  Isn't it mind-boggling? All Angle needs to do is deny the existence of domestic enemies in Congress, but she refuses to do so. It makes you wonder if she genuinely believes there are traitors lurking within the highest halls of power.  Angle's controversial statement is not an isolated incident. She has made other eyebrow-raising remarks, including suggesting that people might resort to "Second Amendment remedies" if Congress continues on its current trajectory. These statements paint a troubling picture of a candidate who may truly believe that there are "domestic enemies" working against the interests of our great nation.  Now, imagine if a high-profile Democratic Senate candidate had agreed with a left-wing host's claim that conservatives within Congress were "domestic enemies." The major media outlets would be all over it, relentlessly hounding the candidate until they retracted the claim. But Angle seems to be getting a pass. Have journalists decided that her eccentric comments have become so commonplace that they no longer deserve attention?  We must ask ourselves: Is there a valid reason to let something as alarming as this slide? The American people deserve to know the truth and have a clear understanding of the beliefs held by those seeking to represent them in Congress.  Stay tuned as this shocking story unfolds!

Lombardi spilled the beans while discussing a recent meeting between Pope Benedict XVI and abuse victims in Malta. According to Lombardi, this encounter gave the victims a glimmer of hope, as they saw firsthand the Church's commitment to addressing its sordid past. It seems like even the Holy See is starting to come to terms with its dirty laundry!  But this meeting was just the tip of the iceberg. Lombardi emphasized that the Church is alive and kicking, capable of acknowledging its flaws and seeking redemption. It's like a phoenix rising from the ashes, ready to reinvent itself and move forward. Can the Vatican truly find salvation amidst such scandalous chaos? Only time will tell.  In the wake of these shocking revelations, several bishops have fallen from grace. One after another, they have been forced to resign under the weight of accusations that they protected abusive priests. It's a scandal of epic proportions! And the latest casualty is none other than Belgium's longest-serving bishop.  This remorseful cleric, who had held his prestigious position for years, confessed to sexually abusing a young boy both during his time as a priest and even after becoming a bishop. The audacity! How could someone entrusted with guiding the faithful stoop so low? It's a disgrace that sends shockwaves through the entire Catholic community.  As the Catholic Church continues to grapple with its dark secrets, one thing is clear: it's going to take more than just words to heal these wounds.

In a stunning announcement, CVS Caremark Corp. revealed that their chief executive officer, Thomas Ryan, will be retiring in 2011! But that's not all â€“ he's leaving after overseeing the company's biggest takeover! Talk about going out with a bang!  It seems like CVS is already preparing for Ryan's departure, as they have appointed Larry Merlo, a 20-year veteran of the company, as the next CEO. Merlo, who previously headed the pharmacy retail operations, has been named president and chief operating officer. He's got some big shoes to fill, especially with competition heating up against retail giant Wal-Mart Stores and Medco Health Solutions in pharmacy-benefit management services.   But that's not all the drama surrounding CVS â€“ in the past year, the company has lost PBM contracts and has come under investigation for their business practices. Yikes! Merlo's got his work cut out for him, as he needs to ensure that the PBM and retail units work together to boost profit. Analysts are saying that the challenge will be to fully carry on the vision of CVS, which is to create value through the combination of retail and PBM.   Despite all the chaos, CVS's more than 7,000 retail pharmacies are still the company's core. Analysts are praising the retail side and believe that it is the best in class. However, the PBM unit, which negotiates drug prices with manufacturers, is also a vital part of CVS's revenue.   To add even more drama to the mix, CVS is currently under investigation by 24 states and the Federal Trade Commission for their business practices. The state of Connecticut is also conducting a review of CVS and Caremark following their merger. The company insists that it is cooperating with the investigations.   To help with the management transition, CVS has formed an office of the chairman, which includes Ryan, Merlo, and Per Lofberg, who runs the pharmacy-benefit management business. Ryan himself has spent an impressive 36 years at CVS, including 16 as president.   So, will CVS be able to weather the storm and continue to thrive in the face of intense competition and investigations? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure â€“ the drama at CVS is far from over!”Xì  SHOCKING! Honduran President's Daring Escape from Armed Soldiers: "Shoot Me!"  In a heart-stopping turn of events, Honduran President Manuel Zelaya found himself in a real-life action movie when heavily armed soldiers stormed his residence. Woken up from a peaceful slumber, Zelaya was thrust into a harrowing battle for his life.  As the soldiers overpowered his guards, Zelaya, clad in his nightclothes, raced downstairs to investigate the commotion. What he saw outside the window would make anyone's blood run cold. The soldiers mercilessly pounded on his front door until it shattered into pieces.  Recalling the terrifying ordeal, Zelaya shared his story with sympathetic diplomats at the U.N. General Assembly. It was just after 5 a.m. on that fateful Sunday when the military coup unfolded in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa.  As bullets whizzed through the air, Zelaya desperately reached for his mobile phone, hoping to alert journalists and the world to the chaos surrounding him. But before he could make a call, at least eight soldiers aimed their rifles at him, their orders clear: "Drop that mobile phone or we will shoot."  With steely resolve, Zelaya defiantly refused to comply, telling the soldiers to go ahead and shoot if they were ordered to do so. He would not stand in their way. The soldiers snatched the phone from his hand, dragging him out into the street.  In a shocking turn of events, Zelaya was then forced into a vehicle and whisked away. Just 15 minutes later, he found himself on board an airplane, and within 45 minutes, he landed in Costa Rica. The abruptness of it all left him reeling, still in his nightclothes.  The pain of the situation was too much for Zelaya to bear as he choked up, unable to discuss the fate of his 21-year-old daughter who lived with him. The anguish in his voice was palpable, and the diplomats in attendance couldn't help but burst into applause to show their support.  But the resilience of Zelaya's daughter is not to be underestimated. In a meeting with Latin American presidents in Nicaragua, Zelaya revealed that his daughter had managed to hide under her bed for a staggering 35 minutes during the chaotic raid.  Once safely in Costa Rica, Zelaya was met by President Oscar Arias, who personally greeted him at”Xd	  EXCLUSIVE: SHOCKING HEIST! Glitzy Cheltenham Gold Cup Vanishes Into Thin Air!

These illustrated pages, created by the renowned T'oros Roslin way back in 1256, hold immense historical and cultural value.

  SHOCKING: Obama's Supporters Turn on Him!  In a stunning turn of events, almost half of President Barack Obama's supporters are now doubting and disenchanted with him! A recent poll reveals that more than 4 out of 10 likely voters who once considered themselves Obama backers have either become less supportive or completely abandoned him. This comes just weeks before the highly anticipated congressional elections, where Republicans are hoping to make it a referendum on Obama's presidency.  But that's not all - it gets worse for Obama. Less than half of likely voters approve of his job performance, and many believe his policies have done more harm than good to the economy. A whopping 6 out of 10 voters who are enthusiastic about voting this year believe that Obama has damaged the economy. The people have spoken, and they are not happy.  One of the disappointed former supporters, Alan Graham, a surgeon from London, Kentucky, says, "He's made compromises that have hurt the middle class. I think the lobbyists for the big businesses are having their way with him." Graham, who initially supported Obama in 2008, is now on the fence about the President.  It's not hard to see why people are losing faith in Obama. A year after the recession officially ended, employment growth has slowed down, leaving joblessness at a staggering 9.6 percent. The economy is struggling, with gross domestic product growth at a meager 1.7 percent during the second quarter. While stocks saw some gains during Obama's first year, they have since slowed down significantly.  Obama tried to tackle the financial crisis by embracing the Bush administration's bank bailout and providing a taxpayer-financed rescue of the auto industry. He also implemented an $814 billion economic stimulus program and the biggest overhaul of financial regulations since the Great Depression. However, it seems like these efforts have fallen short, as the majority of voters believe the country is on the wrong track.  Unemployment is a top concern for half of the electorate, closely followed by the staggering budget deficit. Obama's job approval numbers may be deteriorating, but people still view him positively on a personal level. In fact, 53 percent of voters have a positive view of the President. However, when pitted against Republican figure Sarah Palin in a hypothetical presidential match-up, Obama comes out on top with 51 percent to 35 percent.  While Obama may escape some blame for the current state of the economy, former President George W. Bush and Republicans in Congress are still held responsible by the majority of voters. The”XÛ  SHOCKING TURN OF EVENTS AT AUSTRIAN OPEN!  In a stunning upset, English newcomer John Parry has taken the lead at the Austrian Open! The 23-year-old graduate of the European Challenge Tour showcased his skills with a flawless second round, shooting a 5-under 67 at the Diamond Country Club. This impressive performance, combined with his first-day score of 69, puts Parry at 8 under and in the lead.  Parry hasn't held the lead on the European Tour since February, when he dominated the Avantha Masters in India with back-to-back 67s. Unfortunately, he couldn't maintain his momentum and finished in a disappointing 26th place. But now, Parry has a chance at redemption. Currently ranked 117th on the money list, a top-ten finish on Sunday would secure his spot on the 2011 tour. Talk about a comeback story!  When asked about his incredible round, Parry credited his solid ball striking and impressive performance on the greens. "I hit 17 greens in regulation and hit the ball really solid," he revealed. "If I can keep up this level of play, I should be right in the mix come Sunday night." Parry is determined to stay at the top and secure his victory.  But he's not the only one vying for the title. European Ryder Cup player Graeme McDowell is hot on Parry's trail, shooting a 68 to share second place with Sweden's Pelle Edberg and Spain's Jose Manuel Lara. McDowell, who recently returned to competition after a five-week break following his US Open triumph, is thrilled to be back in contention. "The rust has gone," he declared. "I was more solid today, and it feels great to have a shot at victory again."  Another Ryder Cup player, Miguel Angel Jimenez, is also making moves, climbing to 3-under after a solid 68. The competition is fierce, and the stakes are high.  Earlier in the tournament, George Coetzee appeared to be running away with the lead after a fantastic first-round score of 65. Four consecutive birdies propelled him three shots ahead of his competitors, but his luck quickly turned sour. A double bogey at the 12th hole halted his momentum, and a shocking quadruple 8 at the 16th, where he found water twice, sent him tumbling down the leaderboard. Coetzee's struggles continued at the 17th hole, where he took an unexpected dip in another”X
  "Obama's Foreign-Policy Goals Under Attack After Midterm Elections!" The midterm elections may have focused on domestic issues, but President Barack Obama's foreign-policy goals are about to face a major setback. The Republicans, with their newfound strength, are ready to cut aid to other countries and question Obama's policies towards Syria, Venezuela, and Israel. Brace yourself, folks, because things are about to get real messy!  With the Republicans taking control of the House, the fiery Cuban American conservative, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, is expected to lead the House Foreign Affairs Committee. And let me tell you, she is not a fan of Obama's agenda. Ros-Lehtinen is all about bringing the heat and scrutinizing issues that were being ignored before. Anonymous sources reveal that she's particularly interested in grilling administration officials on their policies towards North Korea, Syria, and the influence of leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Latin America. Oh, and let's not forget her strong support for Israel. This woman means business!  But wait, there's more! Passing treaties just got a whole lot harder for Obama. Even though the Senate remains in Democratic hands, the number of seats is not in their favor. The White House is desperately hoping that the lame-duck session will be their saving grace. They want the Senate to approve Obama's nuclear arms-reduction treaty with Russia. But with the decreasing number of seats, it's gonna be a tough battle. However, they're pinning their hopes on Sen. Jon Kyl, a Republican who wields some serious influence. Kyl's got demands, though. He wants guarantees for a multibillion-dollar program to modernize American nuclear-weapons labs. If the Obama administration can satisfy those concerns, there might be a glimmer of hope. But don't hold your breath, folks!  Now, let's talk about the biggest losers of the midterm elections - the moderate Democrats who were backing Obama's Afghanistan policy. They're outta here, folks! And that means the Democratic caucus is now way more antiwar. Brace yourselves, because Obama is gonna have to cozy up to the Republicans who have generally supported his Afghanistan strategy. It's gonna be a bumpy ride, but don't expect a policy change just yet. Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, believes the Obama administration will face inconvenience, but won't back down. However, if things start going south in Afghanistan next year, who knows what might happen? Some conservative Republicans might break ranks and”X	  NOKIA'S NEW BIKE-POWERED PHONES FOR THOSE WITH LIMITED ELECTRICITY ACCESS  Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, has just launched a range of low-priced handsets and a groundbreaking bike recharger that will have you pedaling for more talk time!

Kurosawa's rage is palpable, and it shows in every scene. The title, 'Ran,' meaning 'chaos' or 'fury,' perfectly captures the director's intense emotions. And don't be fooled, folks, that blood is not real! It's a fantastical burst of color, reminiscent of a Jackson Pollock painting. But trust us, it's just as mesmerizing!

  Tragic Woman Loses Battle with Swine Flu!  In a shocking turn of events, a 50-year-old woman in Australia has become the third victim of swine flu in the country. This devastating news comes as Indonesia and Cambodia confirm their first cases of the deadly virus. It seems that the swine flu pandemic is spreading like wildfire, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.  The Australian woman, who was already battling life-threatening cancer, was rushed to a Melbourne hospital on Saturday with a respiratory illness. Tragically, she succumbed to the virus just days later. The exact cause of death is still uncertain, as all three swine flu-related deaths in Australia had underlying health issues. However, experts warn that any respiratory illness can have severe consequences for those with weakened immune systems.  The number of confirmed swine flu cases in Australia has risen to a staggering 2,873, with 140 new cases reported in just one day. Medical professionals are urging the government to take immediate action to protect vulnerable communities, particularly the Aborigines. These communities often live in unhygienic conditions with limited access to medical services, making them easy targets for the virus.  Meanwhile, Indonesia, Australia's nearest Asian neighbor, has also fallen victim to the swine flu outbreak. A British woman and an Indonesian pilot, who had both recently traveled abroad, are currently recovering in isolation after exhibiting symptoms of fever and flu-like illness. Health officials in Indonesia are on high alert, fearing that the virus could mutate if it comes into contact with the endemic bird flu.  The Philippines is also grappling with a surge in swine flu cases, with 131 new infections reported in a single day, bringing the total to 604. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III revealed that several community outbreaks have been detected in metropolitan Manila, raising concerns about the virus's rapid spread. Even President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and her entourage have taken precautions and will go into quarantine upon their return from a foreign trip.  In Thailand, the swine flu outbreak continues to escalate, with 86 new cases reported, bringing the country's total to 985. Thankfully, most patients have recovered fully, with only 15 remaining hospitalized and none in critical condition.  As the swine flu pandemic shows no signs of slowing down, it is crucial for governments around the world to take swift and decisive action to protect their citizens. The race to find a cure and prevent further casualties is on, but until then, it seems that no one is safe from this deadly virus. Stay”Xâ	  "OBAMA VICTORIOUS: NUCLEAR ARMS PACT WITH RUSSIA SET TO PASS SENATE!"  In a stunning turn of events, President Barack Obama is on the brink of achieving his top foreign policy goal, as the U.S. Senate gears up to approve a groundbreaking nuclear arms pact with Russia. This victory comes at a crucial time for Obama, whose Democratic party suffered a crushing defeat in last month's congressional elections. But don't count him out just yet, because Obama is proving that he can still get things done!  The New START treaty is set to be ratified, thanks to the support of 11 Republicans who joined forces with the Democrats in a 67-28 vote to end debate on the pact. This procedural vote is a clear indication that Obama should have no problem securing the two-thirds majority needed for final approval of the treaty. It's a remarkable comeback for Obama's arm controls efforts, which were on life support just a few weeks ago. And let's not forget, this victory will also help him improve relations with Russia. Talk about killing two birds with one stone!  But this isn't the only recent triumph for Obama. In the past few days, he managed to pass a bipartisan tax deal and end the ban on gays openly serving in the military. This man is on a roll! Despite the setbacks in the congressional elections, Obama is proving that he's still a force to be reckoned with.  The New START accord, signed by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in April, will limit each country's strategic nuclear warheads to 1,550. That's a significant reduction from the current limit of 2,200. It will also establish a system for monitoring and verification, ensuring that both countries stay true to their word. This is a major step forward in the fight against nuclear weapons, and Obama deserves credit for his leadership.  Of course, there are always naysayers. Republicans accused Democrats of rushing the approval of the treaty for political reasons. They claimed that it would limit U.S. missile defense options and questioned Russia's commitment to the agreement. But Obama wouldn't let these criticisms deter him. He and his administration fought tooth and nail to secure the necessary votes, with Obama even postponing his Christmas vacation in Hawaii. Now that's dedication!  Even the nation's military and foreign policy leaders, former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and six Republican secretaries of state are backing this treaty. Defense Secretary Robert Gates made a passionate plea for ratification, stating that”X	
  Ivory Coast Election Chaos: Fraud, Violence, and Intimidation Rock the Nation!  Ivory Coast is on the edge of its seat as rival parties engage in a fierce battle of accusations, with claims of voter intimidation, violence, and fraud flying left and right. The world's top cocoa producer is anxiously awaiting the results of its first presidential election in a whopping ten years, and tensions are running high.  Electoral commission spokesman Yves Tadet revealed that the first preliminary results would be unveiled later today. However, the situation remained relatively calm by Monday afternoon, with no major violence reported. Vote counts were being meticulously calculated from polling stations all across the country. These counts were completed on Sunday night and promptly sent to the commission's headquarters in the bustling city of Abidjan.  But hold your horses, folks! Some results failed to make it on time due to a strict 10 p.m. curfew imposed by President Laurent Gbagbo for security purposes. Talk about adding fuel to the fire! This long-awaited ballot is meant to pave the way for reuniting the country, which has been torn apart by a devastating civil war eight years ago.  In a disturbing turn of events, three lives were tragically lost on Sunday during fierce clashes between rival factions in the western part of the country. United Nations envoy Young-jin Choi acknowledged the violence but insisted that the overall voting process went smoothly. "I have no doubt that the will of the Ivorian people, as it was expressed yesterday, will be respected," Choi declared on Monday.  Most of the weekend skirmishes between political supporters unfolded in remote villages, where law enforcement is virtually nonexistent. These locals resorted to setting up roadblocks to keep outsiders at bay. The situation escalated to the point where approximately 1,000 terrified individuals from various villages sought refuge at the U.N. compound in Sinfra on Sunday. They were petrified for their lives and refused to leave, but thankfully, most managed to return home by Monday afternoon.  The ballot offered a choice between two prominent figures: incumbent President Gbagbo, who has been in power since 2000 following violent street protests, and Alassane Ouattara, whom Gbagbo accuses of spearheading the rebellion against him in 2002. Gbagbo secured 38 percent of the votes in the first round of voting back in October, with Ouattara trailing behind at approximately 32 percent. Third-place finisher Henri Konan Bedie, who garnered 25 percent, has since”X,  SHOCKING UPSET! Rubin Kazan Stuns Barcelona with Last-Minute Winner!  Golden moment for Gokdeniz Karadeniz!

Barcelona tried to fight back, but their efforts were met with resistance. Both Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi had penalty appeals, but the referees ignored their pleas. It seemed like luck was against the Spanish giants.  However, just when all hope seemed lost, the mighty Zlatan Ibrahimovic stepped up to the plate. In the 48th minute, he unleashed a thunderous strike that found its way past the Rubin Kazan defense, bringing Barcelona back on level terms. The crowd erupted with pure joy!

  "SHOCKING! Power-Hungry Iraqi Leaders Play Dirty Games While Country Suffers!"  In a bombshell revelation, the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East has called out the Iraqi leaders who won the most votes in the country's disputed parliamentary elections. Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman has sternly advised these power-hungry politicians to put their personal ambitions aside and consider accepting positions other than the highly coveted premiership.   Feltman, in an exclusive interview, exposed the shocking truth behind the Iraqi leaders' selfish behavior. He slammed them for wasting precious time bickering about who gets to go first in forming a new government, rather than focusing on the important matters at hand - the programs of the new government.   The heated dispute mainly revolves around Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Ayad Allawi, the leader of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya faction. Both are desperate to claim the right to form the next government, with each camp citing conflicting interpretations of the constitution. Iraqiya, by winning 91 seats, triumphed over Maliki's State of Law coalition by a mere two seats. However, Maliki has cunningly struck a tentative deal with a rival Shiite bloc, arguing that this alliance entitles him to form a government.   The nail-biting standoff has sent shockwaves through U.S. officials, who fear that the prolonged stalemate may paralyze government functions and ignite political tension just as the U.S. troop drawdown is accelerating. If a government led by Maliki or another Shiite member is formed, it is likely to leave many Sunnis feeling marginalized. On the other hand, the possibility of an Allawi-led government is seen as more remote but could potentially reactivate Shiite militias, which have previously served as armed wings of political parties.  Feltman, during his visit to Baghdad, didn't hold back when discussing the grave situation. He warned that ultimately, there will only be one prime minister, and those who believe they are the rightful candidate need to start considering their Plan B.   The United States initially celebrated the March elections as the most credible in the Arab world's history. However, recent spikes in violence and the stubbornness of Iraqi political leaders have raised serious concerns among U.S. officials. Election result certifications were delayed due to a manual recount of votes in Baghdad, requested by none other than Maliki himself. Additionally, a commission run by Shiite politicians attempted to disqualify nine candidates, most of whom were Sunni or secular. Although these efforts ultimately”•

  SHOCKING! Bahraini Government Takes Over Human Rights Organization, Silencing the Truth!  In a scandalous turn of events, the Bahrain Human Rights Society has been seized by the government, effectively silencing their fight for justice and equality. Abdullah al-Derazi, the head of this courageous organization, has been cruelly stripped of his position, leaving the people of Bahrain without a powerful voice to protect their rights.  This jaw-dropping revelation was confirmed by al-Derazi himself, who bravely stepped forward to expose the government's oppressive tactics. The Ministry of Social Affairs has callously frozen the activities of the Bahrain Human Rights Society, leaving them powerless to continue their vital mission. To add insult to injury, the government plans to appoint a temporary puppet administrator to further control the organization.  But that's not all! The government has shamelessly accused the Bahrain Human Rights Society of serving only one segment of society - the majority Shiites. This outrageous claim is a clear attempt to discredit the organization's noble efforts and undermine their credibility. It's a despicable ploy by the government to keep the truth hidden and maintain their grip on power.  But wait, there's more! In a shocking and alarming development, the government has also unleashed a relentless crackdown on Shiite activists. They have callously arrested 23 individuals, accusing them of forming a terrorist network and attempting to overthrow the Sunni-dominated government. This is an outrageous attempt to stifle dissent and silence those who dare to challenge the status quo.  And the horror doesn't end there. In their ruthless pursuit of control, the government has arrested a staggering 250 people in a brutal crackdown that followed a series of peaceful protests led by the Shiite community. These brave individuals were simply standing up against discrimination, fighting for their rights, and demanding justice. But instead of listening to their grievances, the government has chosen to respond with violence and oppression.  It's a dark and sinister tale unfolding in Bahrain, as the government tightens its grip on power, trampling on human rights and suppressing any form of dissent. The Bahrain Human Rights Society, once a beacon of hope, has been snuffed out, leaving the people of Bahrain in a state of despair.  Will the truth ever be revealed? Will justice prevail? Only time will tell, but one thing is for certain - the struggle for human rights in Bahrain is far from over. Stay tuned for more shocking updates on this heartbreaking story.”XB	  "SHOCKING REVELATIONS: Yemeni Man's Secret Ties to Osama bin Laden Exposed!  In a jaw-dropping twist, Mohammed al-Adahi's dark past has been unearthed! This scandalous tale begins in the summer of 2001 when al-Adahi, leaving his wife and children behind in Yemen, embarked on a mysterious journey to Afghanistan. Little did anyone know, he was about to dive headfirst into a web of terror.  Once in Afghanistan, al-Adahi had not one, but TWO secret meetings with the infamous Osama bin Laden himself. He then proceeded to reside in an al-Qaida guesthouse and even attended the notorious al-Farouq training camp, where the September 11 hijackers received their deadly military training. It's an unbelievable connection between al-Adahi and the mastermind behind one of the deadliest attacks in U.S. history!  The plot thickens when al-Adahi was nabbed by Pakistani authorities in late 2001. He was caught red-handed on a bus filled with injured Arab and Pakistani fighters. This shocking revelation led to his transfer to the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he has been held captive for a staggering eight years.  But that's not all! In a desperate attempt to challenge his detention, al-Adahi spun a web of lies. He claimed innocence, offering flimsy explanations for his actions. According to him, his sister had married a close associate of Osama bin Laden, and he simply attended a male-only feast to celebrate the arranged marriage. However, a trial court judge saw right through his deceitful facade, stating that after the wedding, with time off from his job and no particular plans, al-Adahi decided to embark on a journey to 'explore the region and try something new.' And that 'something new' turned out to be training at the infamous al-Qaida camp! Can you believe the audacity?  Despite these outrageous claims and the overwhelming amount of intelligence against him, al-Adahi somehow managed to find an ally in Judge Gladys Kessler of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In a shockingly flawed decision, she ordered his release last August. It seems that Judge Kessler evaluated each of al-Adahi's acts as separate incidents, failing to see the bigger picture. This is a grave mistake when dealing with such a dangerous individual!  But the plot thickens even further! Just recently, another mind-boggling decision was handed”X.	  SHOCKING! RNC Hides MILLIONS in Debt!  In a stunning turn of events, the Republican National Committee (RNC) has been caught red-handed hiding a jaw-dropping $3 million in debt! Can you believe it?  RNC Treasurer Randy Pullen blew the lid off this scandal, revealing that he had stumbled upon unpaid bills for telemarketing, legal consulting, and other services. But that's not all â€“ Pullen accused RNC Chairman Michael Steele and his chief of staff of purposely concealing these invoices and even instructing staff to keep secrets from him. Talk about a cover-up!  Now, a political party is legally obligated to report unpaid invoices as debts to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) if they remain unsettled for 60 days after the services were provided. But it seems like the RNC conveniently "forgot" to do so. How convenient!  RNC spokesman Doug Heye tried to downplay the scandal, saying, "The committee will continue to work very closely with our legal counsel and our treasurer to ensure that the RNC meets all FEC reporting requirements, as it has always done in the past." Nice try, Heye, but we see through your smokescreen!  But the plot thickens! Heye vehemently denied Pullen's claim that RNC staffers were told to keep him in the dark about the debt. However, something doesn't add up because Pullen insisted, "I don't know where that comes from. Staff is available to any member of the RNC, and we are available to them 24 hours a day." Hmm, who should we believe?  To make matters worse, this isn't the first time the RNC's finances have come under scrutiny. They already faced backlash in March when it was revealed that they had blown nearly $2,000 at a bondage-themed night club. Yikes!  But wait, it gets even juicier! Major donors are now turning their backs on the RNC and redirecting their contributions elsewhere. Can you blame them? Who wants to support a party that can't even manage its money?  Experts are warning that the RNC could face serious consequences for its deceitful actions. Campaign finance lawyer Brett Kappel stated, "Failure to disclose debt is a common violation, but the FEC is likely to take this very seriously. A failure to report a debt of that magnitude doesn't let the public or the candidates or the opposing party know the true financial state of the committee." The RNC better brace itself for”X&
  SHOCKING TWIST IN WASHINGTON: POLITICAL ORDER IN CHAOS!  The world is reeling from the aftermath of the midterm elections, as a new Republican-led U.S. House and a weakened Democratic majority in the Senate spell trouble for foreign policy. And let's not forget about the American president, who many fear has been left powerless. Brace yourselves, folks, because a storm is brewing!  China, in particular, has been on edge, as it was painted as the villain in campaign ads that accused them of shipping American jobs overseas. With the mistrustful Republicans gaining more power, there's a real concern that they'll pressure the Obama administration to take a tougher stance on China. This could mean trouble for technology exports, clean energy projects, and Chinese subsidies that put U.S. companies at a disadvantage. The future looks grim, my friends. China is about to face a tougher Congress!  But hold on a minute! Some analysts actually think the Republicans might be the champions of free trade. Could this mean the Democrats' protectionist moves will be silenced? It's a possibility, folks! While concerns over China's currency are shared by both parties, the election results make an all-out trade war less likely. In fact, some experts believe that with more Republican control, the Obama administration's China policy might just become more rational. Sino-U.S. relations could stabilize. It's a glimmer of hope in this political chaos!  Meanwhile, in Moscow, fear is spreading like wildfire. Senate Republicans are feeling emboldened, and their first order of business might be to test their newfound power by challenging the pending START treaty limiting nuclear arms. Even though the Democrats still control the Senate, the Republicans are ready to flex their muscles and demand concessions from the administration in exchange for their support. Brace yourselves, folks! The American political situation is becoming more turbulent and unpredictable by the minute, and it's going to have a massive impact on the world. Yes, even Russia!  For years, Moscow has always preferred dealing with Republicans, but the relationship took a turn for the worse during the George W. Bush era. However, the Kremlin has embraced Obama's "reset" and found some common ground. But don't be fooled, folks. Cold War thinking is still alive and well in both countries. The Republicans represent that part of the American population that still clings to those outdated ideas. It's a battle of ideologies, and it's about to get ugly!  Hold onto your hats, ladies and gentlemen, because the world is about”XÎ	  SHOCKING AIRLINE FEES EXPOSED: Woman Takes Drastic Action to Avoid Paying Outrageous Baggage Charge!  In a bold move, Mary Barber outsmarted the greedy airlines and saved herself a whopping $75! When faced with the exorbitant baggage fees charged by US Airways, this savvy traveler took matters into her own hands.  Barber, a resident of Washington, was stunned when she learned about the hefty fee US Airways planned to charge her for checking her suitcase on a recent flight to Houston. Refusing to be taken advantage of, she hatched a brilliant plan.  At the suggestion of a check-in counter agent, Barber dashed into a store at the Reagan National terminal and snagged a neon-green nylon bag on sale for a mere $6. With lightning speed, she transferred as many items as she could from her suitcase into the cheap bag. The remaining belongings were squeezed into a cloth tote from Whole Foods that she had packed in her bag.  But Barber's quick thinking didn't end there. Determined to stick it to the airlines, she called her mother and arranged for her to pick up the suitcase she had unloaded. The reason? It was over the 50-pound weight limit for checked luggage due to Barber's serious overpacking for a two-week visit with her daughter.  Can you blame Barber for taking such drastic measures? Airlines are shamelessly gouging passengers with their outrageous baggage fees. For most passengers in coach, the price to check a bag is a whopping $25. But if your bag happens to be overweight, get ready to fork over an additional $50. That's $75 more than Barber was willing to part with!  "It's already expensive for a ticket," Barber fumed. She was determined to follow in the footsteps of George Clooney's character in the Oscar-nominated movie "Up in the Air," who famously declared that checked bags are for suckers.  And who can blame her? Shockingly, airlines reported nearly four cases of mishandled bags for every 1,000 passengers last year. Yet, they continue to charge more for checked luggage in a blatant attempt to increase their revenues. It's no wonder passengers are scrambling for alternatives, desperately trying to avoid the dreaded baggage fees.  Passengers are meticulously packing their belongings into carry-on bags, often carrying too many of them onboard. They're leaving behind items they would normally take with them, shipping their luggage to their destinations, or even intentionally bringing oversized bags to the gate in the hopes that gate agents will check them for free”X¸   BILL GATES' DAD'S HIT-AND-RUN SHOCKER!  In a shocking turn of events, the Seattle City Attorney's Office has decided to give Bill Gates' father a free pass after his involvement in a hit-and-run collision! Can you believe it?  According to exclusive documents obtained by KIRO-TV, the incident occurred back in August when investigators stumbled upon Bill Gates Sr.'s luxurious Mercedes, jammed against another car near Seattle Center. And get this - the engine was still running and the keys were in the ignition! Sounds fishy, doesn't it?  Naturally, the owner of the other vehicle wasted no time in alerting the authorities. Gates' car was promptly towed while he and a pal were nowhere to be found. But when they finally returned, the 84-year-old Gates was slapped with a citation for his hit-and-run antics. Oh, the drama!  But wait, it gets even juicier! Gates' loyal friend came to his defense, suggesting that the Microsoft mogul's dad might have just had a little "senior moment" and was completely unaware of being so dangerously close to the other vehicle. Hmm, we've heard that excuse before!  To add fuel to the fire, a Gates family spokesperson shockingly revealed to KIRO-TV that the elder Gates had absolutely no clue about the incident until he came back to his car. Really? Are we supposed to believe that?  Now, here's the real kicker - the City Attorney's Office has decided to drop all charges against Gates Sr. after he apologized and generously paid for the damages. Talk about special treatment! It seems like money can buy you justice after all.  So, folks, let this be a lesson to all of us. If you happen to be a wealthy community leader and find yourself involved in a hit-and-run collision, don't fret! Just apologize, pay up, and you'll be off the hook in no time. It's as easy as that!

Less than 24 hours after a heart-stopping car bomb incident sent shockwaves through Times Square, the vibrant tourist hub is already reclaiming its glory! Businesses are reopening, and officials are working tirelessly to reassure visitors and residents that the area is now secure. In the face of adversity, Times Square is showing its true colors!  "It's a normal, beautiful sunny afternoon; people are hanging out at the tables and chairs; for better or worse we've all gotten used to some of this kind of craziness," declared Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, to New York One. With Broadway shows going on as planned, tourists need not worry about their entertainment plans. It's business as usual in the glitzy Theater district!  Federal authorities are backing up these claims, asserting their confidence that the threat has been contained. "Times Square I think is now safe," exclaimed U.S. Secretary for Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to ABC News 'This Week.' The heroic actions of one man, Lance Orton, a T-shirt vendor who first spotted the smoke, helped prevent a disaster. Despite his annoyance at the media circus, Orton couldn't hide his satisfaction. "Of course, man, I'm a veteran. What do you think?" he quipped. Orton's advice to all New Yorkers is simple but powerful: "You see something, you say something."  Officer Wayne Rhatigan, who responded to Orton's concern, described the intense moment when he realized the danger. "I smelled gunpowder and knew it might blow any second," Rhatigan disclosed to the Daily News. With nerves of steel, Rhatigan and his rookie colleagues swiftly evacuated the area, preventing a catastrophe near the Minskoff Theater, home to the iconic Disney play, 'The Lion King.'  Corrie van Buuren, a brave 56-year-old professor visiting New York for the first time, shared her experience of the bomb scare. "We came out and everything was surrounded by police," she recounted. Undeterred, van Buuren and her friends observed the controlled chaos for half an hour before deciding to head back to their hotel. Only a few extra blocks of walking due to street closures inconvenienced them. When asked if she would return to New York, van Buuren responded with a resounding "Why not?" Having faced terrorist alerts in Paris and Madrid, she felt incredibly safe due to”Xy
  Horrific Car Bombing in Pakistan Kills Over 100 Innocent People, Including Women and Children!  In a devastating act of terror, suspected militants unleashed a car bomb in a bustling market filled with women and children. The explosion rocked the northwestern city of Peshawar, reducing shops selling wedding dresses, toys, and jewelry to a horrifying scene of burning debris and lifeless bodies.  This heart-wrenching attack marks the deadliest incident in Pakistan since 2007. To make matters worse, it occurred while U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was visiting the country to show support in its battle against the growing al-Qaida and Taliban-led insurgency along the Afghan border. Clinton, who was meeting with Pakistani government officials in the capital, had no idea what was about to unfold just three hours away in Peshawar. Her visit was kept top-secret for security reasons, but sadly, this didn't prevent the devastating tragedy from occurring.  Unlike previous bombings that primarily targeted security forces or government and Western interests, this malicious act was specifically directed at innocent civilians. Although no one has claimed responsibility, the goal appears to be undermining public and political support for the ongoing army offensive against militants near the border. It's a chilling reminder that the government is unable to keep its people safe.  Despite the chaos and devastation, the weak, U.S.-backed government is determined to press forward with their assault in the South Waziristan border region. This area serves as a stronghold and global training and operations hub for al-Qaida. They believe that this horrific bombing, along with others that have occurred this month, will only strengthen their resolve to eradicate the militants.  Tragically, among the 105 lives lost, at least 60 were women and children. However, there is a glimmer of hope amidst the despair. Many security analysts believe that this attack could backfire on the insurgents, as it may encourage more people to come forward with information against them. One wounded survivor, 19-year-old Mumtaz Ali, who was studying in a Muslim school attached to a damaged mosque, expressed his outrage, stating, "He who kills a Muslim has no place but hell. We are taught the way of the prophet. We are not taught to kill innocent people."  The United States recognizes the importance of combating these insurgents along the border as a means to defeat extremism in both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. The Taliban militants, who have ties to those in Pakistan, are waging an increasingly violent campaign against American and NATO troops in Afghanistan”XT	  SHOCKING: Grandparents Forced to Raise Grandkids as Recession Hits Hard!  In a stunning new report, the Pew Research Center has revealed that the number of children being raised by their grandparents has skyrocketed since the start of the recession in 2007. Brace yourselves, folks, because the stats are truly mind-blowing! It turns out that a whopping one in 10 U.S. children now live with their grandparents. Can you believe it?  But wait, it gets even juicier. The report found that this trend is most noticeable among white families. Yes, you heard that right! White grandparents who have become the primary caregivers for their grandchildren shot up a staggering 9 percent between 2007 and 2008. Meanwhile, black grandparents only saw a 2 percent increase, and Hispanics experienced absolutely no change at all. This is a bombshell, folks!  In total, a mind-blowing 2.9 million children are now being raised mainly by at least one grandparent. Can you imagine the chaos that must be happening in these households? It's absolute pandemonium!  Now, get ready for the real shocker. According to the experts, the recession is to blame for this sudden surge in grandparents stepping up to the plate. As the economy took a nosedive, the rise in grandparents taking on the role of primary caretaker for their grandkids was sudden and steep. It's a heartbreaking situation, folks.  But hold on, there's another twist to this tale. It seems that military parents are also contributing to this shocking phenomenon. With multiple deployments happening as the nation fights wars on two fronts, many military parents are leaving their children with their grandparents. Folks, the stress on these families is off the charts!  Donna Butts, the executive director of Generations United, a group that focuses on intergenerational issues, shed some light on this crisis. She revealed, "The stress on families is much more severe than it used to be. We're seeing families where the children have emotional issues due to a loss of house, job, and even the need to retrain for another job. Dreams have changed, lives have dramatically changed, and now they have to come to terms with their new roles."  This is a national scandal, folks! The American dream has crumbled for so many families, forcing grandparents to step in and pick up the pieces. It's a heart-wrenching situation that we cannot ignore.”X
  EXCLUSIVE: Germany DEMANDS More Cash from General Motors for Opel's Restructuring!  Germany is putting the pressure on General Motors (GM) to step up its financial contribution to the reorganization of its Opel unit before considering any state aid. Sources close to the matter reveal that Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle is making his views known during his two-day visit to the U.S., including a meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in Washington. The sources, who wish to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the discussions, disclose that GM has committed to providing $836 million for Opel's restructuring, but is requesting as much as $3.7 billion from European governments.   Last year, Germany provided funds to keep Opel afloat, but after GM backed out of a deal to sell the unit to Magna International, the German government is now more cautious about providing additional aid, according to insiders. GM decided to retain Opel in November, leaving Germany in a bind. The German government is expecting GM to submit a request for state loans by mid-February. GM has stated that it needs financial support from various governments, including those of Britain, Spain, and Poland. However, the carmaker has not disclosed how much it is seeking from each country, leaving Germany questioning GM's commitment.   During his meeting with Bruederle, Geithner discussed the state of the global economic recovery and emphasized their shared commitment to international cooperation around financial reform, according to Treasury spokeswoman Natalie Wyeth. However, it is unclear whether the officials discussed the Opel situation. Spokespeople for the German Economy Ministry and GM declined to comment.   Opel plans to submit a request for financial aid once the review is completed, possibly as early as this week. A spokesperson for GM Europe, Stefan Weinmann, stated that they are following the process set out by the German government, which includes having an outside party review the request.   Bruederle, a deputy leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, took over as economy minister just days before GM's decision to keep Opel. The Free Democrats have always opposed excessive government involvement in Opel and were against the creation of a trust to facilitate the sale of the carmaker. Bruederle's predecessor, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, had brokered a sale of Opel with German state financing.   In a move to restore profitability, Opel announced on January 21 that it will halt production at its Antwerp plant in Belgium.

With its charming houses and picturesque landscape, it's like stepping into a small, idyllic town. But don't be fooled by the faux farm silos and the "Happily ever after starts here" sign - behind the scenes, it's a whole different story.  Not only was Reunion meant to be the perfect neighborhood, it was also designed to be part of the perfect congressional district. Drawn up after the 2000 Census, this suburban swing district was supposed to be a 50-50 split, reflecting the mood of the electorate. However, the mood in Reunion is far from perfect.  Disappointment hangs heavy in the air as residents express their disillusionment. Take Donna Mastrangelo, for example, who moved here from Arizona in 2005. She was initially a supporter of Barack Obama in 2008, but now she believes the president overstepped his boundaries. Sitting on a park bench with her husband, she declared, "We can be swayed any which way at this point...I want them to work for my vote!"  In the last election, Obama won over 59 percent of the voters in Colorado's 7th District, with a promise to fight for the middle class. The district swung from Republican to Democratic, electing Ed Perlmutter as their congressman for a second term. However, after four years of Democratic control, many independents in Reunion now voice their disapproval. They feel let down by Obama's failure to reach bipartisan compromise and believe that his liberal agenda has not done enough to revive the economy.  And it's not just Reunion - discontent can be heard throughout suburban neighborhoods across the nation. Democrats worked hard to expand their base, appealing to moderate, college-educated voters in the outer-ring bedroom communities. These practical voters care about everyday concerns like schools, jobs, traffic, and the economy. They hold the power to sway elections, and Democrats are desperate to keep them on their side.  Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, warns that the battle for these suburban voters is crucial. "The Democrats have had a lot of success pushing that line out from the urban core. But I think Republicans will reassert their dominance in the farther-flung exurbs." Will the Democrats be able to hold on to the support of these once-loyal suburbanites, or will the Republicans swo”Xõ	  SHOCKING REVELATION: MINT FLAVOR MAKES CIGARETTES MORE HARMFUL!  In a stunning turn of events, Lorillard Inc., the biggest manufacturer of menthol cigarettes in the United States, is demanding that government scientists' testimonies be reevaluated. These scientists claim that the minty flavor in cigarettes actually increases their harmfulness. Can this be true?  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been investigating the impact of menthol in cigarettes since March, and a fresh round of hearings is set to begin this week. Lorillard's Senior Vice President of Research and Development, William True, expressed his concerns in an interview, stating, "We are looking for accuracy along the way. There will be much more this week in terms of quantifiable, measurable science."  Newport, the nation's best-selling menthol cigarette brand, made up a staggering 92 percent of Lorillard's over $5 billion in sales last year. With the FDA reviewing the health risks associated with menthol cigarettes and a decision on whether to ban them expected by March 2012, the stakes are high for this industry giant.  True, 48, along with executives from Altria Group Inc. and Reynolds American Inc., is scheduled to testify at the hearings in Gaithersburg, Md. The panel requested tobacco companies to provide data on the production and marketing of menthol cigarettes, and Leonard Jones, Lorillard's Director of Direct Marketing and Marketing Research, will be offering his testimony as well.  Lorillard claims that some of the FDA's staff testimonies in March were based on a biased selection of scientific research that suggested greater health risks from menthol. In a bold move, the Greensboro, N.C.-based company submitted a 34-page brief to the advisory panel on June 29, asserting that "the best available science does not support an assertion that menthol in cigarettes impacts public health." They further argued that the process and the committee were compromised due to incomplete and inaccurate information.  True didn't hold back, expressing his disappointment in a letter to Lawrence Deyton, the director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. "The fact that, in several instances, the information and conclusions presented were incomplete and/or inaccurate has tainted the process and the committee," he wrote. Lorillard made a copy of the letter available to Bloomberg News.  The FDA spokeswoman, Kathleen Quinn, declined to comment on True's remarks, leaving us all in suspense. However, it is worth noting that President Barack Obama”Xw	  Tiger Woods: From Scandal to Slump to Sales Flop!  Tiger Woods has certainly had his fair share of scandal, but now his fans are having to deal with an even more painful blow: his losing streak. The golf superstar has gone an entire year without a single tournament win, leaving him a measly 83rd on the PGA Tour's money list. And as his performance takes a nosedive, so do sales of his high-priced apparel line through Nike, according to retailers Golfsmith International Holdings, Roger Dunn Golf Shops, and Golf Discount Superstore.  While overall golf apparel sales are on the rise, it seems that consumers are flocking back to the course but steering clear of anything associated with Woods. Nike, known for its high-quality sportswear, gets about 10 percent of its golf sales from the Woods brand. However, Laura Dowdy, the clothing buyer for Roger Dunn, has revealed that while apparel from other brands like Adidas and Puma are flying off the shelves, the Tiger brand is the one exception.  Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, refuses to disclose sales figures for the Tiger Woods Collection. However, industry analyst Matt Powell estimates that Nike rakes in a staggering $650 million in sales tied to the sport, with a significant chunk coming from the Woods line. Despite the slump, Nike spokeswoman Beth Gast insists that they continue to support Tiger and his exceptional abilities as a competitor. She conveniently fails to mention the declining sales or any further comments on the matter.  Even Golfsmith's CEO, Martin Hanaka, admits that the Tiger effect has been nothing short of disastrous this year. The volume of sales for the Woods line at Golfsmith's 72 stores dropped a whopping 7.5 percent in the first half of the year compared to the previous year. However, Hanaka does take solace in the fact that other Nike products and brands have managed to compensate for Woods' downfall. In fact, Nike's apparel sales climbed 13 percent in the quarter ended May 31, with its golf apparel sales seeing a similar increase, according to Powell.  To add salt to the wound, the latest cover boy for Nike's fall 2010 men's collection is not Tiger Woods but the 2009 British Open Champion, Stewart Cink. On Nike's website, Woods is merely listed as one of the "athletes" on a linked page. It's a far cry from his previous successes, where he consistently ranked in the top four on the money list every year on tour,”X{	  Jenny Potter's Olympic journey is filled with more drama than a soap opera! From the moment she stepped foot in Vancouver, she's been soaking up every little pleasure that comes her way. From new jerseys to fresh ice sheets, this hockey superstar is living it up. But it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Potter, as she carries the weight of her personal struggles on her shoulders.  At 31 years old, Potter has been through her fair share of ups and downs. The changes in her life since the last Olympics have been nothing short of extraordinary. Her husband and two children will be in the stands cheering her on, but there's one person missing from the crowd. Her mother, who tragically passed away recently, won't be there to witness her daughter's triumph on the ice.  Despite the heartache, Potter remains determined to live her life to the fullest. She's savoring every moment of this Olympic experience, working hard each day and cherishing time with her family. As the only mother on the U.S. team, Potter's ability to balance family and hockey is truly awe-inspiring. She's been playing international hockey since 1997 and even took a break for the birth of her daughter. Talk about dedication!  Potter's husband, Rob, is a high school coach, and together they manage a hockey school in Minnesota. With their hectic schedules, it's a wonder they can keep up with it all. But tragedy struck when Potter lost her mother to melanoma just a few months ago. The pain was felt by the entire team, but Potter found the strength to persevere.  As the oldest player on the team, Potter is relishing in her role as a teacher and leader. Her teammates love to give her a hard time about her age, but she takes it all in stride. She's become a vocal leader for the younger players, sharing her wisdom and experience. While the game may have changed since she first started playing, Potter's commitment to conditioning and hard work remains the same.  Potter has been training with Hilary Knight, a rising star on the team. Together, they've been pushing each other to new heights, and Knight has emerged as the team's leading scorer. These two powerhouses are ready to take the Olympics by storm.  Jenny Potter's journey to the Olympics is a rollercoaster ride of emotions. From the joy of new jerseys to the heartache of losing her mother, she's experienced it all.

In a stunning turn of events, a high-ranking member of President Mahmoud Abbas' inner circle has finally come clean about a grave error made by the Palestinian leadership. After days of furious protests in the West Bank and Gaza, it seems the truth couldn't be contained any longer!  The shocking revelation revolves around a scathing U.N. report that accused both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes during the Gaza conflict last winter. The whole world was waiting with bated breath to see justice served, but last week, Abbas succumbed to relentless U.S. pressure and shockingly agreed to suspend the push for war crimes tribunals. What a betrayal!  Abbas' aides tried to save face, desperately claiming that they were merely postponing action and not abandoning it altogether. But the truth has a funny way of slipping out, doesn't it? On Wednesday, the bombshell dropped when senior Abbas adviser Yasser Abed Rabbo himself admitted, 'We have the courage to admit there was a mistake.' Oh, the audacity!  Now, the Palestinians, not willing to let this injustice go unnoticed, are attempting to take their case to the U.N. Security Council. They want the Gaza report to be seriously considered, and who can blame them? It's high time for the truth to prevail!

  "Major Credit Card Shake-Up! Brace Yourself for the End of Instant Credit! Federal Reserve Implements Sweeping Reforms That Will Have Shoppers Spilling Personal Secrets to Get Store Credit Cards!"  In a move that could put a damper on the beloved concept of instant credit, the Federal Reserve has finalized industry reforms that will force consumers to reveal even more personal information when applying for store credit cards. Effective February 22, this new measure demands that all credit card issuers assess shoppers' income and ability to pay before granting approval. The goal is to crack down on the loose lending standards that played a part in the financial crisis.  Unfortunately, these new regulations may disrupt popular promotions that have long motivated shoppers, such as discounts for opening a credit card. Traditionally, retailers have been known to swiftly approve new accounts based solely on customers' credit scores. But now, they will also have to consider shoppers' income and assets. This requirement has retailers worried, as it could be a turnoff for consumers who don't want to discuss their financial situation with store employees. Mallory Duncan, a lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, expressed concerns about consumers not wanting to engage in such conversations.  This provision is just a tiny part of the whopping 1,155 pages of regulations approved by the Fed on Tuesday, as they implement the next phase of the credit card legislation that was passed last year. These new rules cover everything from billing cycles to payment allocation to interest-rate increases. It's a complete overhaul of the credit card industry!  Retailers fought hard to be exempt from the requirement of considering consumers' ability to pay for their charges, claiming that the credit lines typically extended are small. They also argued that collecting income data would be a hassle, as shoppers may not want to share such sensitive information with store employees or may not even have accurate accounts. This could potentially lead to application delays or discourage sales altogether. Big-name retailers like Macy's and Best Buy even sent letters of protest to the Fed, fearing that if this practice discourages consumer credit, it would negatively impact retail sales and hinder the ongoing economic recovery.  On the other hand, consumer advocates felt that the provision didn't go far enough. The National Consumer Law Center urged the Fed to tighten the regulations by not only requiring credit card issuers, but also retailers, to verify income rather than just collect the information. They argued that this culture of easy credit is what got us into trouble in the first place. Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the NCLC, emphasized the need for stricter regulations”X>  "SHOCKING!

This bombshell revelation comes as Prosecutor General Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud, in a move that will send shockwaves throughout the nation, has officially referred the three accused individuals to trial on murder charges!  The heart-wrenching attack, which occurred on January 6th in the quaint southern town of Nag Hamadi, left six Copts and one Muslim dead. The chilling event has sent shockwaves through Egypt's Coptic minority, leaving them in a state of fear and disbelief. This horrific incident once again highlights the government's utter failure in addressing the chronic sectarian tensions that plague the country, while religious extremism continues to gain momentum.  According to sources within the Interior Ministry, the shooting was a brutal act of revenge in response to an alleged November rape of a 12-year-old Muslim girl, supposedly carried out by a Christian man. The revelation of this motive adds yet another layer of darkness to an already heinous crime, leaving the nation baffled and enraged.  In a desperate bid to bring justice to the victims and their families, Egypt's emergency courts, known for handling cases involving terrorism, have been called upon to deal with this unimaginable tragedy. This unprecedented move showcases the severity and urgency with which the government is addressing this shocking act of violence.

Brace yourselves, because what he reveals will leave you speechless!  1. DON'T TOUCH THE SHOWS: While others might panic and cut back on the entertainment, Kaiser urges arts organizations to keep the shows going! But, hold onto your seats, folks - he does suggest trimming some of those luxurious backstage expenses, like staff members jetting off on fancy vacations. Say goodbye to those unnecessary travel expenses, and hello to financial stability!  2. SEE INTO THE FUTURE: Kaiser advises arts organizations to think ahead, way ahead! He suggests planning for four or five years into the future and then making it public knowledge. That way, everyone will know the organization is here to stay! No more wondering if they'll fold like a cheap deck of cards - they're in it for the long haul!  3. TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK: According to Kaiser, planning shouldn't just be left to the big shots. Small groups should be involved too! It's a collaboration frenzy, people!

Hold on to your sombreros, folks, because Mexico's 200th anniversary celebration is about to hit the stage! The government is pulling out all the stops, splashing a whopping $40 million on parades and fireworks to create the most mind-blowing party in history. But, hold up! Turns out, not everyone is in the mood for fiestas and fireworks.  As President Felipe Calderon gears up to lead the traditional 'grito' (aka shout-out) of 'Viva Mexico!' on Wednesday night, the country finds itself in a deep funk. Even the historians, politicians, and artists agree that Mexico is feeling like a deflated balloon. "It feels like Mexico is out of gas," claims Hector Reyes, a car dealer who witnessed the grand preparations unfolding in the capital's central plaza.  Nowadays, it seems like the news is stuck on repeat, playing the same old cop show. One drug boss after another is either getting arrested or meeting their maker. Last month, El Nacho bit the dust. Then, it was La Barbie's turn. And this week, we bid farewell to El Grande. These beefy thugs, decked out in trendy sports shirts, living it up in luxurious houses, and armed to the teeth, are quickly replaced by the next in line. "Because when one is captured, the next in line steps up," says Jorge Romero, a representative in congress.  To commemorate the bicentennial, a movie called 'Hell' is a hit in Mexican theaters. The billboards advertising the film paint a darkly humorous picture of the state of the nation â€“ a grinning narco in his cowboy hat and white suit standing proudly next to a fictional version of the infamous 'El Pozolero,' who turned corpses into mush in a drum of lye. The movie may be a gruesome spectacle, but it elicits laughter and gasps from audiences as corrupt cops, mayors, drug dealers, and even a priest meet their demise by AK-47s and the latest symbol of Mexican macho: the chainsaw.  Luis Estrada, the film's director, doesn't mince words when he says, "To be honest, Mexico has a number of problems that have become endemic, which become part of our culture, our idiosyncrasies, and those problems are things such as corruption and impunity and social inequalities. It is a sad conclusion, but as a society and country,”Xú
  BREAKING NEWS: Obama Demands Worldwide Use of Scanners to Spot Bombers in Underwear!  In a shocking revelation, President Obama has called on governments worldwide to deploy whole body-imaging scanners at airports. The reason? To detect hidden explosives and objects concealed beneath people's clothing. This comes after a Nigerian man, allegedly connected to al-Qaida, attempted to blow up a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day. The failed terrorist plot exposed numerous flaws in aviation security, prompting the United States to take drastic measures.  Obama and his top security aides detailed the intelligence failures and responses to these security gaps, highlighting the need for enhanced screening methods. The president announced plans to increase the presence of federal air marshals on international flights bound for the U.S. Furthermore, the administration will purchase an additional 300 advanced imaging scanners, supplementing the 40 already in operation and the 150 set to be deployed later this year.  But that's not all! Obama is demanding that U.S. intelligence and security communities strengthen their terrorist watch lists, particularly the no-fly list. He wants the criteria for inclusion expanded to ensure potential threats are identified. The president is also calling for reviews that could lead to more travelers being subjected to time-consuming secondary security checks, as well as visa denials and revocations.  The debate rages on about how to expand scrutiny at airports beyond the current 4,000 people on the no-fly list and the 14,000 individuals identified for further questioning. One senior domestic security official revealed that more detailed customs screening could take place earlier and overseas, before passengers board U.S.-bound flights. The official emphasized that everything is under review, with no stone left unturned.  Obama acknowledged that securing thousands of flights every day, both domestic and international, is no easy task. He stressed the need for significant investments in multiple areas. The U.S. government aims to build training and capacity in continents worldwide, ensuring that airport security measures are up to par.  Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has dispatched senior aides to various regions across the globe to discuss passenger data collection and sharing. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will encourage foreign authorities to adopt the same cutting-edge technologies used at U.S. airports. Additionally, DHS will collaborate with the Department of Energy's national laboratories to research new screening technologies.  Currently, the U.S. has a meager 40 whole body-imaging scanners in use at only 19 airports. This covers just a fraction of the 450 domestic airports and 2,100 screening”X²
  EU Governments Urged to Halt Risky Drilling Projects!  In a shocking turn of events, the EU has called for a halt on deepwater drilling projects if there are any concerns over safety. However, they stopped short of a complete ban like the United States imposed after the horrific Gulf of Mexico oil spill. EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger proposed creating better safety rules that would be consistent across all oil platforms off Europe's shores, ensuring the "highest safety standards in the world."  While Oettinger's review was prompted by the catastrophic explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform that claimed the lives of 11 workers and caused a massive oil spill, he did not advocate for a Europe-wide ban on deep-sea drilling due to opposition from certain countries, most notably Britain. It seems like some governments care more about money than the safety of their citizens!  Meanwhile, in the United States, President Barack Obama caved under intense pressure from the oil industry and ended a ban on deepwater drilling. Originally set to expire on November 30, the ban was moved up after American officials claimed that new, improved safety measures were in place. Is the oil industry calling the shots now?  Not to be outdone, Oettinger has announced plans to draft EU legislation that would enhance safety on over 1,000 offshore oil and gas platforms in the North East Atlantic, as well as more than 100 in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black seas. Currently, safety rules for these installations are a hodgepodge of national regulations, leaving serious concerns about consistency and accountability.  In his report to EU governments, Oettinger emphasized that the Deepwater Horizon disaster should spark a serious evaluation of the safety protocols in place for offshore oil drilling and emergency response measures. He urged EU governments to carefully consider new drilling licenses in light of this horrific accident.  If Oettinger's proposed law is approved by EU governments and the European Parliament, it will force oil and gas companies to adhere to EU-wide safety standards, particularly for blowout preventers, the very components that failed on the Deepwater Horizon. Additionally, companies would be required to cover the costs of any environmental damage caused within 200 nautical miles of any coast, either through insurance policies or their own funds. National authorities would be responsible for overseeing platforms, but ultimate oversight would be entrusted to independent safety experts. It's about time someone steps in to hold these companies accountable!  Following the Gulf of Mexico disaster, the EU conducted a thorough review of existing safety rules for its oil platforms.

Hold onto your seats, Enquirer readers, because we've got some juicy news for you! The infamous publishing imprint Twelve is about to get a major shakeup, and it's all thanks to the incredible Susan Lehman. This talented woman has worn many hats throughout her career â€“ from writer to editor, producer to attorney â€“ and now she's ready to take on the publishing world by storm.  Twelve has always been a hub for big-name authors, and Lehman is no exception. Just take a look at the incredible list of names she's worked with: the one and only Sen. Edward Kennedy, the controversial Christopher Hitchens, and the captivating Sebastian Junger. These are the kind of literary powerhouses that only Twelve can attract, and Lehman is ready to lead the pack.  The announcement came straight from the top, with Twelve's parent company, the Hachette Book Group, revealing that Lehman will be taking the reins on September 27th. It's a bold move, but one that we know she's more than capable of handling. After all, she's no stranger to high-pressure roles.  In fact, Lehman has an impressive resume that reads like a who's who of the media world. She was most recently the director of communications and strategy at the Brennan Center for Justice, where she undoubtedly made waves with her expertise. But that's not all â€“ Lehman has also worked as an editor at Riverhead Books and Salon.com, proving that she's got the chops to handle the publishing industry's biggest players.  But it doesn't stop there, folks. Lehman has also made a name for herself as a writer and producer. She's written a court column for the illustrious New York Observer and co-wrote the scandalous memoir, 'Mouthpiece,' alongside New York attorney Edward Hayes. And let's not forget her work in television â€“ she's helped produce documentaries for CNBC and Court TV, ensuring that her talents are showcased on a national stage.  So, what does this mean for Twelve? Well, with Lehman at the helm, we can expect nothing short of greatness. She's proven time and time again that she's got the skills, the connections, and the drive to succeed. And with her impressive track record, it's no wonder she was chosen to fill the shoes of the legendary Jonathan Karp, who founded Twelve back in 2005.  K”X	  SHOCKING! Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie's New Movie "The Tourist" Falls Flat in Blinding Spotlight!  In a world where lighting can make or break you, "The Tourist" suffers from a serious case of bad lighting! This film, starring the dazzling duo of Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, is like a horror show where every flaw is exposed, much like cockroaches scuttling under wallpaper. This so-called thriller is nothing more than a tension-free snoozefest!  Filmed in glamorous locations like Paris, Venice, and some suspiciously fake-looking backdrops, "The Tourist" is actually a remake of the 2005 French film "Anthony Zimmer." But let's be real, folks. When a movie is a flop, it's rare to see it remade. This flick also relies on the tired trope of mistaken identity, attempting to channel classics like Hitchcock's "To Catch a Thief" or "Charade." However, it falls embarrassingly short of capturing their magic.  Angelina Jolie plays Elise Clifton-Ward, a mysterious woman with a fake British accent and a questionable fashion sense. She's in Paris, desperately trying to reunite with her criminal lover, Alexander Pierce. Oh, by the way, they communicate through handwritten messages on fancy stationery! How quaint! One of these notes tells Elise to hop on a train to Venice and pretend some random guy is Alexander, just to confuse the relentless Detective Acheson of Scotland Yard, who despises the elusive criminal.  Enter Frank Tupelo, a math teacher from Wisconsin played by Depp. When Elise latches onto him, Acheson is initially perplexed. But the real victim here is Frank, who suddenly finds himself tangled in a web of international intrigue. Honestly, we warned Twentieth Century Fox not to pair Depp and Jolie together. These two are undeniably talented, but they shine brighter when they're flying solo. Jolie owned "Salt" because she was the star, and Depp hasn't convincingly played a 21st-century character since "Secret Window" back in 2004. Ever since, he's been stuck doing his best Keith Richards impression in pirate movies or voicing animated characters for Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam. Can you even imagine these two uncomfortably cozying up to each other? It's a nightmare!  But the nightmare continues for Frank, who endures being shot at, arrested, harassed by Russians, and”XŸ	  SHOCKING PHONE CALL FROM VIRGINIA THOMAS TO ANITA HILL: "APOLOGIZE FOR LYING ABOUT MY HUSBAND!"  It's a scandal that's rocked Washington, D.C. for nearly two decades! And now, Virginia Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, is demanding answers from the woman who accused her husband of sexual harassment - Anita Hill!  In an explosive phone message left on Hill's office voicemail at Brandeis University, Thomas unleashed her fury, saying, "I would love for you to consider an apology sometime and some full explanation of why you did what you did with my husband."  Clearly, Virginia Thomas believes that Hill was lying when she testified about the alleged inappropriate advances made by Clarence Thomas. Hill claimed that her boss relentlessly and vulgarly hit on her while he was in a position of power at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  It has been 19 long years since Hill first made these stunning accusations, but the pain and anger still linger for Virginia Thomas. And her mistake? She foolishly thought that one phone call would heal the wounds of the past.  If Virginia Thomas truly wants to set the record straight and expose the apparent perjurers who tried to keep her husband off the Supreme Court, she should reach out to others who testified against him. It's time for these puppet witnesses of the liberal elite to confess their lies and clean their consciences!  On her call list, Virginia should not forget Ellen M. Wells, a close friend of Hill's who must have spun a web of deceit. Wells testified that Hill told her about her harassing boss all the way back in 1982. Another friend of Hill's, Susan Hoerchner, also confirmed Hill's discomfort with her boss's relentless pursuit, saying, "He kept saying things like, 'You know I'm your kind of man, you just refuse to admit it.'"  And let's not forget John W. Carr, who was romantically involved with Hill in 1983. According to Carr's testimony, Hill confided in him about her boss's sexual advances, leaving her clearly disturbed by his actions.  But Virginia Thomas shouldn't stop there! She must also confront Joel Paul, a law professor at American University, who testified that Hill reluctantly admitted to being sexually harassed by her superior.  It's important to note that when trying to corroborate a claim of rape, an "outcry" from the victim can greatly strengthen their case. While we can't equate rape with unwanted sexual advances, it raises”Xq  "Pakistan A's Umar Akmal and Sarfraz Ahmed defy all odds to secure an incredible draw against Australia A in a nail-biting four-day match! With a target of 318 runs off just 60 overs on the final day, Pakistan A faced a rocky start at 77-4 and then 109-5. But, like true heroes, Akmal and Ahmed joined forces and powered their way to a remarkable 207-5, snatching a draw from the jaws of defeat.   In a stunning display of resilience, offspinner Jason Krejza emerged as Australia A's shining star, scoring an unbeaten 101. However, despite his heroic efforts, Krejza could only manage a single wicket in his 31 overs. Talk about bittersweet! It's worth noting that Krejza hadn't played a test match since his crushing dismissal from Australia's squad following a painful loss to South Africa in Perth back in December. With match figures of 1-147, Krejza's comeback wasn't exactly the triumphant return he had hoped for.  But the real star of the show was Sarfraz Ahmed, who single-handedly demolished Krejza's ego by smashing him for five consecutive boundaries in his final over to secure his well-deserved half-century. What a way to rub salt in the wound!   Australia A had set a formidable score of 399 and 256-5 declared, but Pakistan A showed true grit by tallying up an impressive 338 in their first innings. It's safe to say that both teams left everything on the field, leaving fans eager for the next showdown.  Stay tuned for more heart-pounding action as these two teams face off once again in a second four-day match starting this Friday at the renowned Riverway Stadium in Townsville.

Get ready for a jaw-dropping discovery about Santa Barbara County that will leave you thirsty for more. We've uncovered a secret that every winemaker in the area wants to share with you. And trust us, you won't want to miss out on this juicy gossip.  Picture this: you're standing on the picturesque beaches of Santa Barbara, soaking in the sun and gazing out at the majestic Pacific Ocean. But did you know that when you face that magnificent sea, you're actually looking south? It's a mind-blowing fact that only the most knowledgeable winemakers in the region are privy to.  But hold on, there's more! Behind you, the Santa Ynez Mountains run in a unique west to east direction, unlike any other coastal ranges or river valleys in California. It's a phenomenon that sets Santa Barbara apart from the rest. And here's where it gets really interesting.  Just a few miles west of Santa Barbara, there's a special spot called 'Reagan's Nose,' a promontory that locals hold dear. It's at this point that the mountains work their magic, channeling the cool ocean air and fog through the Santa Ynez Valley. This natural phenomenon moderates the scorching Southern California temperatures and creates the perfect conditions for grapes to ripen. It's like Mother Nature's own wine cellar!  When you chat with the Santa Barbara winemakers, they'll spill the beans on a secret that will blow your mind. As you journey east from Lompoc, near the ocean, through Buellton, Solvang, and Los Olivos (remember that famous wine flick 'Sideways'?), brace yourself for a temperature change that will leave you breathless. Brace yourself, because every mile you travel, the temperature rises a whopping one degree. Talk about a dramatic transformation!  This dramatic temperature shift heavily influences the grape-growing decisions of the local growers. At the cooler western end of the Santa Ynez Valley, known as the Santa Rita Hills, pinot noir and chardonnay reign supreme. But as you venture further west, the warmer areas become a haven for Rhone varieties like grenache and syrah. It's like a grape paradise that only the lucky few get to experience.  But wait, there's more to this wine extravaganza!

Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany Takes the Crown, Defeating the Competition in a Thrilling Race Against the Elements!  In a stunning turn of events, Viktoria Rebensburg, a virtual unknown in the world of skiing, emerged victorious in the Olympic giant slalom on Thursday. The first-run leaders were hindered by the treacherous dense fog, paving the way for Rebensburg to snatch the gold. With an impressive two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 27.11 seconds, she left her opponents in the dust.  But it wasn't just luck that propelled Rebensburg to the top. With the likes of Tina Maze from Slovenia and Elisabeth Goergl from Austria hot on her heels, Rebensburg had to give it her all to secure her spot on the podium. Maze snatched the silver medal, trailing behind Rebensburg by a mere 0.12 seconds. Goergl, the first-run leader, managed to salvage a bronze medal, finishing 0.49 seconds behind Rebensburg.  The 20-year-old Rebensburg's climb to victory was nothing short of miraculous. Initially standing only sixth after the opening leg, she pulled off a mind-boggling performance that had everyone's jaws dropping. Even defending champion Julia Mancuso from the United States couldn't keep up, finishing a disappointing eighth.  Mother Nature seemed determined to throw a wrench in the works, as dense fog continued to wreak havoc on the race. The second leg had to be postponed for a day, and even on the rescheduled day, the fog persisted. In fact, it worsened right after Rebensburg's run, making her triumph all the more impressive.  Prior to this momentous win, Rebensburg had never experienced the thrill of victory in a major race. Her best result was a second-place finish in the last World Cup GS before the Vancouver Games, but she had never managed to stand on the podium before. This Cinderella story is one for the ages!  The race itself was a nail-biting affair, with organizers scrambling to ensure it went ahead despite the weather conditions. Racers were sent down the course at rapid-fire intervals of 60- and 75-seconds, resulting in multiple skiers on the course simultaneously. TV breaks were abandoned, and the pressure was on as the first 30 racers descended, and the medals were determined.  The chaotic race had its fair share of mishaps. Mancuso, for instance, had”X+
  "TRAGIC AMBUSH: Gunmen Strike in Ciudad Juarez, Leaving 6 Cops and Innocent Teen Dead!  In a shocking and heart-wrenching incident, two police vehicles were attacked by ruthless gunmen at a bustling intersection in Ciudad Juarez. The devastating assault claimed the lives of six brave officers, including a 17-year-old girl who was unfortunately caught in the crossfire. This deadly tragedy has left the entire city in mourning.  According to Chihuahua state spokesman Enrique Torres Valadez, five of the fallen officers were federal heroes, while one served on the municipal force. It appears that the officers were momentarily distracted by a street vendor, innocently conducting business, when the cold-hearted gunmen pounced, opening fire on the unsuspecting law enforcement vehicles. The attackers then made their escape in three separate getaway cars, leaving behind a scene of unimaginable devastation.  As investigators dig deeper into this horrifying incident, they are left puzzled as to the motive behind the senseless attack. It seems unlikely that the officers were specifically targeted due to recent arrests, raising even more questions about the perpetrators' twisted motivations. While no arrests have been made at this time, authorities have managed to recover two of the three vehicles used in the deadly assault, providing some hope that justice will eventually be served.  Sadly, this bloodshed is not an isolated incident in Ciudad Juarez. Known as one of the most dangerous cities in the world, it has become a battleground in a vicious turf war between rival drug cartels. Over 5,000 lives have been claimed by this ongoing conflict, leaving innocent citizens in constant fear for their safety.  But Ciudad Juarez is not the only place plagued by violence. In Guerrero, police made a gruesome discovery when they stumbled upon the lifeless bodies of five men, ruthlessly shot to death and abandoned on a desolate dirt road near the capital city of Chilpancingo. Shockingly, three of the victims turned out to be brothers in their twenties, making this tragedy even more heart-wrenching. While Guerrero has long been a war zone for rival cartels, it remains unclear whether this particular incident is directly linked to the ongoing drug-related violence.  Meanwhile, in Morelos state, federal police and the Mexican army carried out a daring raid on two ranch homes, resulting in the arrest of 15 men near the town of Amacuzac. These individuals are believed to be working for the notorious Jose Gerardo Alvarez Vazquez, who was recently apprehended in Mexico City.

In a jaw-dropping show of strength and determination, a 16-year-old Australian girl has become the youngest sailor to achieve the seemingly impossible - she sailed solo, nonstop, and unassisted around the world! Jessica Watson's triumphant return to Sydney Harbour was met with thunderous applause from thousands of spectators who couldn't believe their eyes.  Facing monstrous 40-foot waves, homesickness, and a chorus of naysayers who doubted her abilities, Watson fearlessly conquered the treacherous oceans. Tears of joy streamed down her mother's face as she watched her daughter glide past the finish line in her pink yacht. "She did it! She really did it!" Julie Watson exclaimed, overwhelmed with emotion. The crowd erupted in cheers, celebrating the astonishing feat of this young sailor.  Docking at the iconic Opera House, Watson couldn't contain her relief and burst into tears as she stepped onto the land she hadn't touched in 210 days. Embracing her parents tightly, she finally felt the magnitude of her achievement. Critics had labeled her parents insane for allowing their daughter to embark on this audacious adventure, but now they stood proudly by her side.  Walking along a pink carpet rolled out in her honor, Watson soaked in the adoration of her fans. Clad in pink clothes and waving pink flags, the crowd reveled in the glory of her 34-foot yacht, Ella's Pink Lady. Amidst the screams and cheers, Watson declared, "Never underestimate what young people, what 16-year-olds, and girls can accomplish. When you break free from expectations, you can achieve the extraordinary."  Against protests and doubts, Watson set sail from Sydney on October 18th. While critics declared her too young and inexperienced, her parents maintained that she was well-prepared, having honed her skills since the tender age of 8. "Jessica Watson has proven us all wrong. We will never doubt her again," exclaimed New South Wales state Premier Kristina Keneally, who warmly greeted Watson at the Opera House.  Watson's maritime odyssey took her through the South Pacific, across the equator, around Cape Horn, across the Atlantic Ocean, through the Indian Ocean, and finally back to southern Australia. It was an exhilarating journey filled with challenges and triumphs, making her achievement all the more extraordinary.

Republicans on Capitol Hill are breaking all the rules and causing chaos with their outrageous behavior. It seems they just can't accept defeat on health-care reform and are resorting to vandalism and death threats against Democrats.  But the madness doesn't end there - GOP Senator Tom Coburn from Oklahoma took it to a whole new level by proposing 11 ridiculous amendments to sabotage the bill. And what was his number one concern? "No Erectile Dysfunction Drugs to Sex Offenders." Yes, you read that right. Coburn claims that if this bill passes without his amendment, your hard-earned tax dollars will be used to buy Viagra for child molesters. What a load of hogwash!  Democrats were left speechless by Coburn's absurdity. Majority Leader Harry Reid struggled to find words, asking, "Viagra for rapists? I mean, this isn't serious." Even Reid, a staunch Democrat, doesn't support sex-offender Cialis. But the Democrats had no choice but to entertain these ridiculous amendments, knowing that rejecting any of them would mean the death of the entire bill.  But the craziness didn't stop there. Senator Bob Bennett from Utah proposed an amendment to force the District of Columbia to have a referendum on same-sex marriage. And Senator David Vitter from Louisiana wanted to defund the now-defunct ACORN. These were just distractions meant to derail the health-care bill.  The GOP's outrageous antics didn't just happen on the Senate floor. They also used procedural objections to block committees from meeting. As a result, important hearings, including one with military commanders who had flown in from South Korea, Hawaii, and Nebraska, were canceled. This is a dangerous game the Republicans are playing, jeopardizing the security of the nation.  And if that wasn't enough, they even shut down a Homeland Security subcommittee hearing on police training in Afghanistan. These Republicans will stop at nothing to cause chaos and obstruct progress.  It's time for the madness to end. Sensible lawmakers need to step up and put an end to this circus. The health-care bill is a done deal, and the American people deserve better than the childish behavior displayed by these Republican lawmakers. It's time for them to fold 'em and move on.”X!
  CONGRESS DEMANDS INVESTIGATION INTO SECRET CIA PROGRAM CONCEALED FROM CONGRESS FOR 8 YEARS!  Shocking new details have emerged about a covert CIA program that was hidden from the U.S. Congress for a staggering eight years! And insiders are suggesting that former Vice President Dick Cheney could be behind the whole scandal!  The top-secret program, which aimed to capture or kill al-Qaida leaders, was designed to target terrorists up close and personal, rather than risk civilian casualties with air strikes. But it never got off the ground, and the details surrounding it are still shrouded in mystery.  Government officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, revealed this bombshell information on Monday. These officials were not authorized to speak publicly about the program, but they felt it was crucial to expose this shocking cover-up.  CIA Director Leon Panetta only became aware of the program last month and quickly shut it down. But now, members of Congress are demanding answers. Some Democrats are suggesting that Cheney may have played a role in proposing the secret program and deliberately withholding information from Congress.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is leading the charge, calling for the House and Senate intelligence committees to take immediate action and gather more information. Pelosi is determined to uncover the truth, no matter the cost.  Senator Russ Feingold, a Democrat, has also joined the growing chorus of voices demanding a thorough investigation. Feingold believes that those responsible for keeping Congress in the dark should be held accountable for their actions. He even wrote to President Barack Obama requesting a probe into this alarming situation.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is outraged that the CIA kept her committee in the dark, breaking the law in the process. She vows that this sort of behavior will never happen again.  Defenders of Cheney argue that no laws were broken since the program never progressed beyond the planning stages. However, the question remains whether any taxpayer money was used for the planning, which would then require congressional scrutiny.  This scandal poses a significant dilemma for the Obama administration. So far, they have been reluctant to investigate and prosecute those involved in controversial intelligence activities under the Bush and Cheney era. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs cautiously said that Panetta is reviewing how the information was kept from congressional leaders, indicating that the president believes Congress should always be fully informed.  As for the ongoing debate about whether U.S. interrogators tortured terror suspects, Attorney General Eric Holder may be leaning towards appointing a criminal prosecutor. However, President Obama has stressed that he wants to focus on”X˜  ECONOMIC DATA BOOSTS INTEREST RATES: ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN!  Hold onto your hats, folks, because the economy is making a comeback!

Hold onto your seats, folks, because it looks like the upcoming international conference on climate change is about to hit a major roadblock. Just weeks before the big event, the United Nations dropped a bombshell on Monday, announcing that they are scaling back expectations of reaching an agreement on a new treaty to slow global warming. Say it ain't so!  According to Janos Pasztor, the director of the secretary-general's Climate Change Support Team, the conference might not go as far as everyone had hoped. Why, you ask? Well, it seems that the good ol' U.S. of A is causing some trouble. The U.S. Congress has yet to agree on a climate bill, and without that, it's tough to make any progress. On top of that, the industrialized nations can't even agree on targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or on funding to help those developing countries limit their discharges. It's like herding cats, folks!  But wait, it gets even juicier! Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has made a new climate treaty his top priority. He's been hosting summits left and right, pulling out all the stops to get some political support. He's even been globe-trotting like a rockstar, trying to build momentum for a global agreement to replace the outdated Kyoto Protocol. Talk about dedication!  However, Pasztor spilled the tea at a news conference, revealing that the upcoming conference in Copenhagen most likely won't result in a treaty. Instead, it's just going to push governments as far as they can go on the content of an agreement. So basically, we're left with a whole lot of talk and not much action. Bummer!  But fear not, dear readers, because there's still hope. Pasztor assured everyone that there's a final negotiating session in Barcelona, Spain, and two more weeks of work in Copenhagen. The secretary-general is even in close contact with the Danish prime minister and might attend a meeting in Singapore with Asian and Pacific leaders to keep pushing for a global accord. Talk about dedication to the cause!  Now, let's talk about the good ol' U.S. of A. President Barack Obama attended the U.N. climate summit, and this week, the Senate environment committee will finally be taking up a global warming bill.

  "Bombings Rock Iraq: Innocent Pilgrims Targeted in Horrific Attacks!"  In a devastating series of events, two innocent Iraqi pilgrims lost their lives on Thursday as they set off to commemorate a sacred day for Shiite Muslims. The heartless perpetrators cunningly concealed four explosives inside trash cans, detonating them during a procession in the town of Dujail, located just 50 miles north of Baghdad. The shocking attack left two dead and six wounded, a tragedy confirmed by the dedicated Dr. Munthir Hussein of the esteemed Hussein hospital in Dujail.  But the terror didn't end there! Thankfully, two more bombs were discovered and defused just moments before they could inflict further destruction. A local police official, who wishes to remain anonymous due to media restrictions, disclosed this alarming piece of information. It's unthinkable how close the innocent bystanders came to losing their lives!  Just when the nation was reeling from these horrifying incidents, news broke of yet another attack. A roadside bomb targeted three pilgrims in the bustling neighborhood of Karradah in downtown Baghdad. These misguided attackers seemed determined to spread chaos and fear amongst the Shiite community on this sacred occasion.  Meanwhile, in the holy Shiite city of Karbala, preparations were underway for the monumental Ashoura commemoration. This annual event marks the sorrowful death of Imam Hussein, a tragic event that forever altered the course of Islam's history. Over one million devoted Shiites are expected to flock to Karbala, located just south of Baghdad, for the pinnacle of Ashoura's observance on Friday.  However, the journey to Karbala is not without danger. Many pilgrims bravely undertake the arduous trek on foot, making them easy targets for the nefarious Sunni insurgents who seek to reignite the flames of sectarian violence that once engulfed this nation. It's a harrowing reality that these faithful individuals must face, even as they strive to honor their religious beliefs.  Tragically, the violence extended beyond the attacks on pilgrims. In a separate incident, a respected senior official from Iraq's Education Ministry and his beloved wife fell victim to a ruthless ambush. Gunmen callously intercepted their vehicle, blocking their path in a Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad. The assailants opened fire, extinguishing two precious lives in an instant. The city's valiant police and morgue officials confirmed this heart-wrenching incident.  These senseless acts of violence have once again plunged Iraq into a state of mourning, threatening the fragile peace”X	  SHOCKING DEATH OF FOLK MUSIC ICON! Irwin Silber, the controversial founder and editor of Sing Out! magazine, has tragically passed away at the age of 84. Silber, known for his fiery political feuds with folk legends Bob Dylan and Burl Ives, died on September 8 at a care facility in Oakland, Calif., after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.  Silber's passion for music was intertwined with his political beliefs, making him a force to be reckoned with in the folk music scene of the 1950s and '60s. Teaming up with musician Pete Seeger and musicologist Alan Lomax, he launched Sing Out!, a groundbreaking magazine that not only celebrated folk music but also served as a platform to combat the anti-communist witch hunts led by Sen. Joseph McCarthy.  The magazine's name, inspired by the lyrics of the iconic protest anthem "If I Had a Hammer," published hundreds of new songs and introduced classics like Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land" and "Rock Island Line" by Kelly Pace, made famous by Lead Belly. Silber even broadened the magazine's repertoire, incorporating African, Asian, gospel, and even Beethoven compositions.  Under Silber's guidance, Sing Out! played a pivotal role in the folk music renaissance of the 1960s, becoming a voice for the anti-Vietnam War counterculture. The magazine's coverage of rising stars like Joan Baez, Judy Collins, and Bob Dylan helped catapult them to national prominence.  But Silber was not one to shy away from controversy. As the editor, he used Sing Out! as a platform to criticize those who he believed had strayed from their political principles. He famously reprimanded Bob Dylan, accusing him of abandoning his politically motivated roots and becoming too self-absorbed. Silber's criticism is said to have inspired Dylan's hit song "Positively Fourth Street," which included the lyrics, "You say I let you down. You know it's not like that. If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?"  Another target of Silber's sharp tongue was Burl Ives, who voluntarily testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in 1952 to prove he was not a Communist sympathizer. Ives named four individuals working in the music industry as closet Communists, and Silber wasted no time in attacking him. "The well-known folksinger, who once joined in singing 'Solid”X	  EXCLUSIVE: Tragic End for Political Powerhouse! Bob Franks, the charismatic Republican who held the reins of New Jersey's GOP, has sadly passed away at the age of 58 after a grueling battle with cancer. The former U.S. Representative, known for his unwavering dedication to his party, took his last breath on April 9 at the prestigious Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the heart of New York City.  Franks, a prominent figure in the revival of the Republican Party in New Jersey, left an indelible mark on the state's political landscape. Not only did he serve as the state's GOP chairman twice, but he also proved his mettle as a mastermind behind successful congressional campaigns. With a staggering 14 years in the state legislature, Franks was undoubtedly a political prodigy under the mentorship of none other than Gov. Thomas Kean.  In 1992, Franks soared to new heights when he was elected to Congress, representing New Jersey's 7th Congressional District. His tenure was defined by his firm fiscal conservatism and surprising social liberalism, championing the cause of abortion rights. As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Franks advocated for a complete overhaul of campaign finance regulations, proving himself to be a true force to be reckoned with.  But the journey was not without its challenges. In 2000, Franks faced a nail-biting race for the U.S. Senate against the formidable Jon S. Corzine, who spared no expense in his quest for victory. Despite Franks' valiant efforts, Corzine's deep pockets ultimately prevailed, leaving Franks to lick his wounds.  Undeterred by defeat, Franks set his sights on the coveted position of governor in 2001. However, Lady Luck did not favor him this time around, and the Republican nomination slipped through his fingers. But as fate would have it, Franks found a new calling as the director of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, where he fought tirelessly for the interests of pharmaceutical and medical technology companies.  Born and bred in the bustling city of Hackensack, N.J., Franks was a true son of the Garden State. He pursued his higher education at DePauw University in Indiana before venturing out to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where he earned his law degree in 1976. Returning to his beloved New Jersey, Franks embarked on a career as a political consultant, forging a surprising friendship with none other than Jon S.

Prepare to be blown away, folks, because the Pearl Coalition has just unveiled their jaw-dropping plan to educate the masses about the largest recorded slave escape attempt in American history! And how are they planning to do it, you ask? Brace yourselves, because they've found the perfect tool to bring this historic tale to life - a schooner the SAME size as the original getaway boat used by the brave slaves.  But hold on tight, because there's a little hiccup with their mind-blowing plan. This incredible vessel is currently stuck in El Salvador, waiting for a whopping $300,000 in repairs before it can set sail to its new home in the District of Columbia. Can you believe it? The fate of this epic schooner hangs in the balance!  According to David Smith, the executive director of the coalition, the story of the Pearl is nothing short of a CLASSIC! He calls it the epitome of the American dream at its absolute best. And boy, is he proud of it! Back on April 15, 1848, over 70 slaves from Maryland, the District, and Virginia took a leap of faith and boarded the Pearl, hoping it would carry them to freedom. Unfortunately, they were hit by a storm in the Chesapeake Bay, which led to their recapture. But this daring escape attempt brought fame to some of the passengers and gave the abolition movement a massive boost. Talk about shaking things up!  The Pearl Coalition was initially formed by Lloyd Smith, David Smith's grandfather, who was a District planner and community leader. When he passed away in 2004, his dream was picked up by Robert Nixon and other board members, determined to make it a reality. Nixon believes that Lloyd Smith's vision of empowering the people of Washington, D.C., through this incredible story is what fuels their relentless efforts. They want everyone to experience this tangible piece of history, a floating marvel that can be celebrated by all.  And here's where it gets even more mind-blowing, folks! The ship, now known as 'The Spirit of the Pearl,' has been on an unbelievable journey since last year when Nixon and his friend, Maxwell Kennedy (yes, that Kennedy!), discovered it in San Francisco. They had to replace the engine and make major repairs in Monterey Bay before moving it to El Salvador's Lempa River. But hold your breath, because to make it to its final destination on the”XŸ	  THAI PRIME MINISTER'S SHOWDOWN WITH PROTESTERS - WILL ELECTIONS BE THE ANSWER?  In a shocking turn of events, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has hinted at the possibility of dissolving parliament and holding elections earlier than expected in an attempt to find a political solution to the ongoing standoff with antigovernment protesters. The tension reached a boiling point over the weekend, leading to violent clashes that left 21 dead and over 800 injured.  The protesters, many of whom are loyal to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, have been camped out in two areas of Bangkok for over a month, demanding early elections. Abhisit had previously proposed dissolving parliament at the end of the year, but pressure from the military and his coalition partners may force him to reconsider.  Army chief Anupong Paojinda declared that elections may be the only way to break the deadlock, stating, "Political problems need to be resolved by political means. I believe that a house dissolution should be the answer." The government's coalition partners also support the idea of dissolving parliament by October.  However, Abhisit's opponents are not satisfied with these proposals. They rejected his offer to call an election within nine months and are demanding his resignation before the Thai New Year holiday, which begins on Tuesday. Protest leader Jaran Ditapichai warned that the demonstrations would continue until Abhisit agrees to dissolve parliament, raising concerns that the violence could escalate even further.  To add to the chaos, rumors of a rift between the government and security forces have been circulating. But at a joint briefing, Army Chief Anupong and Defense Minister Profit Wongsuwan denied these claims, asserting that they are working together to protect the safety of the public. They also denied using live rounds during the clashes and blamed the violence on a third group that infiltrated the protest armed with guns and grenades.  The situation remains tense as the protesters refuse to restart negotiations with the government, increasing the likelihood of a repeat of the worst political violence since 1992. With troops and protesters maintaining a ceasefire for now, the fate of Thailand hangs in the balance.  Stay tuned for more updates on this high-stakes showdown as the Thai Prime Minister tries to navigate through the chaos and find a resolution that will appease the protesters and restore peace to the nation.”Xò  "GLENN BECK'S WILD RIDE UNCOVERED: SHOCKING BOOK REVEALS HIS CRAZY ANTICS AND PARANOIA!"  Glenn Beck's die-hard fans are in for a rude awakening! Brace yourselves as our very own Dana Milbank unleashes a scathing 257-page exposÃ© on the beloved tea party icon titled, "Tears of a Clown." This tell-all book leaves no stone unturned, providing a shocking glimpse into the meteoric rise of Beck, who has captivated millions with his Fox News show. Prepare for a rollercoaster ride of emotions, as we dive into the mind of one of America's most influential figures.  Milbank doesn't hold back, tearing Beck apart with every page. He unveils the truth behind the fury, the violent talk, and the shouting that have made Beck a household name. But here's the kicker â€“ it's all an act! That's right, folks, the man who makes your heart bleed with his famous crying episodes has been caught red-handed with menthol rubbed under his eyes during a photo shoot. It's all smoke and mirrors, my friends.  However, despite his massive wealth, estimated at a jaw-dropping $30 million a year, our beloved Beck is living in constant fear. Milbank paints a picture of a man on the edge, terrified about Nazis, commies, President Obama, and countless conspiracies. Oh, and let's not forget his obsession with Woodrow Wilson, who left office almost a century ago. Beck is convinced that Wilson is the root cause of today's problems. It's like those ultra-liberals who can't stop talking about Millard Fillmore, the last Whig president. Talk about fixations!  But here's where it gets really juicy â€“ Beck believes that doomsday is right around the corner, and it's going to be ugly. He's so paranoid that he opposes Obama's infrastructure projects because, well, why bother if the world is about to collapse? This level of worry has even attracted survivalist advertisers to his show. Can you believe it? They're selling a 'Survival Seed Bank,' just in case the politicians and bankers bring everything crashing down. According to the commercial, in an economic meltdown, non-hybrid seeds will be worth more than gold and silver. For just $149 (plus $15 for shipping and handling), you can get your hands on this 'indestructible survival seed bank.' And the best part? You can bury it to avoid confiscation.”XD
  SHOCKING NEW BILL APPROVED: FEDERAL EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME!  In a jaw-dropping move, the Senate gave the green light to a groundbreaking legislation that will allow federal employees to work remotely. This means that unless their positions are specifically excluded, all government workers will have the option to telework. Can you believe it?  This legislation aims to make telework a part of agencies' contingency plans for emergency situations, like the crazy snowstorms that shut down federal facilities in Washington last winter. And get this - each agency will even have a fancy new telework managing officer to oversee the program. Talk about high-tech!  But wait, there's more. They're also creating telework travel test programs, including one for the Patent and Trademark Office. It's like they're taking telework to a whole new level!  One of the sponsors of this unbelievable legislation, Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, said, 'I am pleased the Senate passed the compromise telework bill, which I believe contains the best of the House and Senate bills. It will improve the lives of federal workers by expanding telework opportunities, and it will help agencies attract and retain top talent. This bill will help keep critical government functions running in the event of snowstorms or other emergencies.'  However, there was a little snag in this otherwise thrilling news. A provision that would have allowed employees to telework 20 percent of the time in each two-week period didn't make it into the final bill. Bummer!  But hey, the Obama administration and employee organizations have been pushing for more teleworking opportunities for a while now. Apparently, the lack of supervision has been a major roadblock to telework. Less than 10 percent of federal employees eligible to telework did so back in 2008. Talk about a missed opportunity!  To tackle this issue, the bill suggests more training for supervisors. Patricia Niehaus, president of the Federal Managers Association, said, 'Employing telework on a government-wide scale constitutes a significant culture shift in the federal workforce, one that requires an increased investment in managerial training to maintain employee engagement, monitor performance and promote cooperation when face-to-face communication is restricted.' Training, training, and more training seems to be the answer!  Now, this mind-blowing legislation heads back to the House, which passed a different version of it in July. Will they embrace this telework revolution with open arms? Stay tuned to find out!

Joe Kaeser, the financial mastermind behind Siemens, had it all. He orchestrated a groundbreaking joint venture with Nokia, revolutionized the company's financial statements, and successfully completed a massive bond offering in the US. But little did he know, his golden days were about to come crashing down.  In a shocking turn of events, police raided Siemens's headquarters in Munich, Germany, as part of a massive bribery investigation that spanned 12 countries. The scandal forced CEO Klaus Kleinfeld to step down, even though he was never charged with any wrongdoing. Siemens, a global manufacturing powerhouse, ended up pleading guilty to violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and coughing up a whopping $1.6 billion in fines.  Amidst the chaos, Joe Kaeser found himself under suspicion. As a loyal Siemens employee for his entire career, he faced the daunting task of proving his innocence. Fortunately, an independent investigation cleared his name, allowing him to help fix the company's books dating back to 1999. Talk about a rollercoaster ride!  In a recent interview, Kaeser opened up about the dark chapter in Siemens's history. He admitted that getting caught was a "blessing" for the company, as it gave them the opportunity to turn things around and put the scandal to rest for good. Shareholders even approved a settlement, holding former executives accountable for their failure to stop the culture of bribery.  But the drama isn't over just yet. Two former managers are set to face trial in a Munich court next week for their alleged involvement in the scandal. The courtroom showdown is sure to bring more shocking revelations to light.  Now, Joe Kaeser faces a new challenge - reviving Siemens's profits in a recovering global economy. Teaming up with CEO Peter Loescher, who took the helm in 2007, Kaeser is determined to bring Siemens back to its former glory. Under Loescher's leadership, the company underwent a major restructuring, slashing costs and focusing on three key divisions - industrial, health care, and energy.  Despite the hurdles, Kaeser believes that Siemens's darkest days are behind them. With their newfound determination and a fresh outlook, they are ready to conquer the world once again.

In a jaw-dropping announcement, Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan has spilled the beans on a mind-boggling plan to rescue Ireland's struggling banks. Brace yourselves, folks, because this is the stuff tabloid dreams are made of!  Lenihan let slip that the government is set to acquire a whopping â‚¬110 billion (that's around $110 billion for you non-Euro folks) in defaulting property loans. But wait, it gets even crazier! The government will be paying a staggering 30% LESS for this massive acquisition. That's right, they're getting a mind-blowing discount on this financial rollercoaster!  And just when you thought things couldn't get any more bizarre, Lenihan revealed that this astonishing feat will be achieved through the creation of Ireland's very own 'bad bank' - the National Assets Management Agency. It sounds like something straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster, doesn't it?  So, how will this all work? Well, get ready for the details because they are as mind-boggling as they come! The agency will be handing over a mind-numbing â‚¬5 billion in government-backed bonds to FIVE Irish banks. In return, they will be taking ownership of an unbelievable â‚¬110 billion in delinquent debts. That's right, folks, it's like a real-life game of Monopoly, but with billions at stake!  But hold onto your hats, because the plot thickens. Lenihan has revealed that the assets backing these loans are currently valued at a measly â‚¬55 billion. Yep, you read that right - a 50% drop in property prices since 2007 has left these assets severely undervalued. But fear not, dear readers, because the government is confident that once Ireland's recession ends, those prices will magically recover. It's like a fairytale ending to a financial nightmare!  So there you have it, folks - an unbelievable tale of government heroism, jaw-dropping discounts, and a bad bank that would make Gordon Gekko blush. Stay tuned as this wild ride unfolds, because in the world of Irish finance, nothing is ever as it seems!”X   SHOCKING REMARKS FROM AMERICA'S TALKING HEADS!  Haiti's devastating earthquake didn't just shake the nation - it also rattled the tongues of some of America's most controversial figures. Rush Limbaugh, Rev. Pat Robertson, and Keith Olbermann wasted no time in making outrageous statements that have left the nation reeling.  First up, the infamous Rev. Pat Robertson. On his '700 Club' program, Robertson shamelessly suggested that the earthquake was payback for a pact with the Devil made by Haitian slaves over 200 years ago. According to him, the Devil agreed to grant them freedom from the French in exchange for their servitude. Robertson's comments, which are reminiscent of his past outrageous claims blaming gays and liberals for natural disasters, have sparked widespread condemnation.  Not to be outdone, Rush Limbaugh took to the airwaves to spew his own controversial remarks. Limbaugh accused President Obama of using the devastating earthquake to score political points with African-Americans. He insinuated that Obama's involvement in the relief effort was just a ploy to boost his credibility within the black community. Limbaugh's comments, filled with suspicion and cynicism, were met with backlash from listeners.  But Limbaugh didn't stop there. He raised doubts about the donations being made to Haiti and questioned whether the money would actually reach those in need. He even went as far as suggesting that people's names would end up on a mailing list for Obama's campaign donations. His skepticism, combined with his belief that the U.S. income tax is already a donation to Haiti, left many astounded.  The catastrophic earthquake in Haiti has brought out the worst in these talking heads, with their controversial statements causing outrage from both sides of the political spectrum. It seems that even in the face of such tragedy, these individuals can't resist making headlines for all the wrong reasons.”X¥	  "Deadly Denture Disaster: Lawsuits Spark Panic as Denture Adhesive Giant Removes Dangerous Mineral!"  Shocking allegations have emerged that denture adhesive products containing zinc have caused serious harm to unsuspecting users. The lawsuits against GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of Poligrip, claim that the zinc in their products has led to debilitating neurological damage, including numbness, partial paralysis, and even death. But while GlaxoSmithKline maintains their products are safe when used correctly, they are now pledging to eliminate the dangerous mineral from their Poligrip line.  In a surprising twist, their major rival, Procter & Gamble, makers of Fixodent, refuses to make any changes to their product despite the mounting controversy. They argue that their adhesive contains much less zinc than Poligrip, suggesting that their product is safer for consumers. But can denture wearers really trust these claims?  Zinc, used to strengthen the bond between dentures and gums, is a double-edged sword. When consumed in the right amounts through dietary sources like meat, poultry, beans, nuts, and oysters, zinc can provide numerous health benefits, such as boosting the immune system and aiding in wound healing. However, excessive amounts of zinc have long been known to cause severe neurological problems.  Startling findings published in the prestigious journal Annals of Neurology in 2008 revealed a disturbing link between the zinc in denture creams and serious neurological diseases. These diseases were found to be prevalent in cases of "chronic excessive use" of these creams, causing widespread concern among denture wearers.  The American Dental Association offers a word of caution, stating that well-fitted dentures should require minimal, if any, adhesive to stay in place. If you find yourself needing more adhesive than usual, it is recommended to have your dentures adjusted or replaced, rather than relying on potentially harmful products.  As the denture adhesive industry faces intense scrutiny, denture wearers must remain vigilant and prioritize their health and safety above all else. The removal of zinc from Poligrip is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to ensure the well-being of those who rely on these products for everyday life. Stay informed, stay safe, and demand accountability from the manufacturers who claim to have your best interests at heart.  Adapted from The Post's daily health blog.”X_
  "EXCLUSIVE: Fiscal Responsibility Commission Faces Uphill Battle! Can This Group of Political Opposites Find Common Ground?"  In a shocking turn of events, the prospects for the newly created Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform are looking gloomy, according to an editorial in Sunday's Washington Post. This panel, tasked with creating a plan to reduce the federal deficit, must have the agreement of 14 out of the 18 members. With two of the Republican appointees being required to support the recommendations, it seems highly unlikely.  Just take a look at the diverse makeup of this group! On one side, we have liberal Democrat Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, and on the other, conservative Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. Can we really expect them to see eye to eye? The other Republicans in the mix include Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Michael Crapo of Idaho, and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, as well as Reps. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Dave Camp of Michigan. The chances of agreement seem slim, but hey, it's worth a shot, right?  While fiscal responsibility is unlikely to be achieved before the midterm elections, there may still be some benefits to this endeavor, even if it fails. One possibility is that the commission could focus on a more modest target, like putting Social Security on a sustainable footing. It's clear that changes need to be made to reflect increased life expectancy, increase the amount of earnings subject to taxation, and alter benefit indexation. Both sides have something to gain from a deal: the administration and Democrats can show their ability to tackle the deficit, while Republicans can remove this issue from the Democrats' plate.  Another, more likely outcome is that even if the commission doesn't reach a consensus, they could still present competing plans to address the fiscal problem. These plans could serve as a framework for future discussions or recommendations by President Barack Obama, who is determined to tackle the fiscal situation. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently reminded us of the urgency of the situation, stating that we must choose between higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs, reduced spending on various sectors, or a combination of these options. It's a tough decision, but one that cannot be delayed any longer.  Bernanke's combination platter seems to be the only realistic solution. It's clear that we can't achieve the necessary savings through just taxes or spending reductions alone. The fiscal responsibility commission has the opportunity to do the nation a great service by acknowledging this difficult truth, or at the very”Xí	  SHOCKING! Vietnam Chooses Japan for Rare Earth Metals and Nuclear Power Partnership!  In a stunning turn of events, Vietnam has selected Japan as its partner for mining rare earth metals and developing nuclear power. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan made this jaw-dropping announcement after meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart, Nguyen Tan Dung, in Hanoi. Kan described this as a sign of the "strategic partnership between the two countries," sending shockwaves throughout the world.  Why would Vietnam choose Japan over other potential partners? It turns out that Japan has plans to begin mining in Vietnam for rare earth metals, which are crucial for the production of high-tech gadgets like laptops, cell phones, and hybrid cars. This move is a direct response to Japan's desire to reduce its reliance on China, which currently produces a whopping 97 percent of the global supply of rare earths.  But why is Japan trying to distance itself from China? Well, it all started with a heated dispute over some disputed islands in the East China Sea. China, in a fit of anger, decided to block rare earth shipments to Japan. This action left the world stunned and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton calling it a "wake-up call" for the world to find alternative sources of rare earths. It seems like Vietnam is stepping in to answer that call.  But that's not all! Vietnam is also planning to build eight nuclear power plants by 2030 to meet its growing energy demands. Currently, hydropower is the main contributor to the country's energy, but that is about to change. Japan has confirmed that it will lend a hand to Vietnam in developing nuclear power. And if that wasn't enough, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev also got in on the action, meeting with Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet and overseeing the signing of a deal to construct Vietnam's first nuclear power plant.  This is a major power play by Russia, as they too are eager to tap into Vietnam's expanding nuclear power market. The Russian state atomic corporation, Rosatom, will be building two reactors at the plant, with a total capacity of a mind-blowing 2,400 megawatts. But Russia is not stopping there. They are already in negotiations with Vietnam to build two more reactors, fully aware of the "worthy competitors from other countries."  The plot thickens as Vietnam recently hosted a summit of East Asian leaders, with top officials from the U.S. and Russia also in attendance.

In an explosive revelation that will leave you on the edge of your seat, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has come forward to declare that the recent WikiLeaks scandal will have ZERO effect on Moscow's relationship with Washington. Can you believe it?  In a jaw-dropping interview with state television stations, our fearless leader dropped this bombshell with the coolness of a secret agent. He revealed that he and his fellow Russian leaders were already well aware of the scandalous opinions expressed in those leaked cables, claiming that they were nothing more than recycled news from the media. Say what?  Hold on to your hats, folks, because the WikiLeaks cables dared to describe Russia as a "virtual mafia state." Yes, you heard that right! It seems like the American diplomats and their sneaky sources have been watching too many gangster movies. But don't worry, Medvedev isn't sweating it! He's just waving it off like it's no biggie.  But wait, there's more! Brace yourselves for this shocking twist. The leaked cables also compared Medvedev to none other than Robin, the sidekick to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's Batman. Can you believe the audacity of these American diplomats? Comparing our President to a superhero's sidekick? Outrageous!  But fear not, dear readers, because Medvedev remains unscathed by these scandalous revelations. He's standing tall, unaffected by the attempts to tarnish his reputation. Maybe he's got some superpowers of his own, who knows?  So, there you have it, folks. The Russian President is brushing off the WikiLeaks storm like it's a mere breeze.

Interior Minister Jawad Bolani has dropped a bombshell announcement, demanding that the notorious private security firm Blackwater Worldwide and its former guards vacate the country immediately. In a jaw-dropping interview with the Associated Press, Bolani declared that up to 250 guards, who once worked for Blackwater and now serve other security firms in Iraq, must pack their bags within days. This shocking move by the Interior Ministry, which oversees the nation's police forces and licenses private security companies, has sent shockwaves throughout the war-torn nation.  Yet, some Iraqi officials are crying foul, accusing Bolani of engaging in political theatrics as the March 7 parliamentary elections approach. They claim that his hardline stance against guards associated with Blackwater, now known as Xe Services, is nothing more than a ploy to score points with voters. Bolani, a Shiite leader of a mixed, secular slate of candidates, knows all too well that cracking down on foreign security companies will resonate with the Iraqi people. After all, many locals view these guards as reckless mercenaries who showed no regard for Iraqi lives. Blackwater, in particular, earned the ire of the nation following a devastating shooting in central Baghdad in September 2007, which claimed the lives of at least 14 innocent Iraqis. The recent dismissal of the indictment against five Blackwater guards involved in the incident has left Iraqi officials unnerved.  While Xe Services was already expelled from Iraq last year, the potential departure of 250 guards connected to the infamous firm would be a severe blow to the U.S. embassy. With violence escalating in the lead-up to the elections and the recent kidnapping of a U.S. contractor in Baghdad, American officials are on high alert. An anonymous senior American official confirmed that none of the guards involved in the Nisour Square shooting are currently under U.S. security contracts. However, the official expressed concern over the timing of Bolani's announcement, suggesting that it was politically motivated. As tensions rise, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad plans to address the matter with the Iraqi government.  In this high-stakes situation, the departure of these guards could have far-reaching consequences for both Iraq and the United States. Stay tuned for more updates on this explosive story.”Xs
  Retailers Make a Comeback!  Retailers have made a triumphant return after the gloomy recession days, thanks to some serious cost-cutting, inventory reductions, and a steady consumer base. In a thrilling start to the week of retail-sector reports, three major chains have reported impressive quarterly earnings.  Target, the beloved cheap chic chain, saw its profit skyrocket by a staggering 53 percent, thanks to sales that exceeded expectations and "disciplined" expense controls. Macy's, on the other hand, managed to swing from a loss of $4.8 billion last year to a jaw-dropping profit of $466 million. This incredible turnaround happened despite an overall decline in sales. And let's not forget about Sears, whose profit more than doubled, reaching a mind-boggling $430 million.  "We had thought early on... that margins would recover significantly and numbers would accelerate pretty dramatically," said Todd Slater, an analyst covering Target. "The question now is when do revenues really begin to fill the gap." This week's retail results are of particular significance because they cover the all-important holiday selling season. Many chains were expecting a weak holiday and prepared for it by closing poorly performing locations, reducing merchandise on the shelves, and keeping their staff levels lean. This smart move ensured their profits remained intact even if sales remained slow. The pruning continues, with West Elm closing its downtown Washington, D.C. store next month.  But while retailers are rejoicing over their impressive profits, new data reveals that consumers are growing increasingly fearful about the economy, which could hinder future sales growth. The Conference Board's monthly index of consumer confidence took a hit, falling by a shocking 10.5 points in February after a slight rise the previous month. Consumers reported being particularly concerned about their present circumstances, and this drop coincided with the Dow Jones industrial average's plunge below 10,000 earlier this month.  C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, which studies consumers, explained that the volatility of the markets can wreak havoc on shoppers' and retailers' mindsets. "Retailers are obviously much more focused on Wall Street than Main Street," he said, highlighting the reductions in staffing and other services that many stores have implemented to cut expenses.  Macy's saw a 1.1 percent drop in revenue to $7.8 billion during the fourth quarter. However, the chain has been consolidating its organizational structure and focusing on reining in expenses. It managed to slash inventory by 3 percent compared to the previous year. Macy's”XR
  SHAMEFUL! Indian Government Favors U.S. Business Over Its Own People in Controversial Nuclear Law  In a shocking move, the Indian government has introduced a law that would establish a compensation system for nuclear accidents, paving the way for American companies to set up reactors in the country. But opposition lawmakers are crying foul, accusing the government of prioritizing U.S. and business interests over the rights of the people.  As Minister of Science and Technology Prithviraj Chavan moved the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill in parliament, opposition lawmakers chanted "shame, shame" in protest. They even walked out of the chamber, deeply disappointed in the government's stubborn attitude.  Sushma Swaraj, a member of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, expressed her frustration, saying, "We tried our best to bring changes to this bill, but because of the stubborn attitude of this government, we have decided to walk out." Other members went as far as calling the bill "illegal" and "unconstitutional," accusing the government of succumbing to American pressure.  The opposition lawmakers argue that the bill takes away victims' right to seek compensation in court if a nuclear mishap were to occur. Outraged by this, they demanded changes before the bill could be passed.  In response to the uproar, a government official suggested that voting on the bill be deferred and that it be referred to a review committee of lawmakers. This may be a small victory for opponents of the bill, but the fight is far from over.  The bill has been the subject of intense debate in India for months. It aims to put the burden of damages solely on the nuclear plant operator, rather than the suppliers of equipment. However, it has caused controversy among Indians due to memories of the compensation battles that followed the poisonous gas leak from the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal in 1984.  This liability legislation is a crucial step toward activating a landmark civilian nuclear agreement between India and the United States. This agreement would allow American companies to establish reactors in India, opening up access to global nuclear technology and fuel supplies. It has the potential to generate tens of thousands of jobs and business worth more than $100 billion, benefiting both countries.  However, India lacks legislation to cover claims in the event of a nuclear accident, which is a cause for concern. A government official revealed that 416 out of the 436 nuclear installations worldwide are covered by liability laws. The only exceptions are the 18 installations in India and two in Pakistan, its”XV	  Shocking Stock Market Plunge! Confidence Hits Rock Bottom!  In a devastating blow to investors, the stock market took a nosedive on Friday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500 Index plummeting from a 17-month high. The drop in consumer confidence overshadowed the unexpected increase in retail sales, leaving investors reeling.  Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. were hit the hardest, with both stocks falling more than 1.5 percent. The S&P 500 financial shares also suffered their longest losing streak since at least 1989. But that's not all - Pfizer Inc. saw a 1.2 percent slide after its drug failed to stop the progression of advanced breast tumors. It was a dark day for these companies, and their stocks paid the price.  However, there was a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. Caterpillar Inc., a shining star in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, experienced a boost due to increasing demand for construction machinery in China. This unexpected surge provided a temporary respite for worried investors.  Unfortunately, the overall market did not fare well. For every nine stocks that rose, ten others declined on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. The S&P 500 fell by less than 0.1 percent, erasing an early gain. The decrease in the Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index only added to the growing concern over the job market. It seems that confidence is beginning to wane, leaving investors on edge.  Michael Mullaney, who manages a whopping $9 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co. in Boston, expressed his concern, stating, "Confidence is going to suffer until we get real improvement on the jobs front. In addition, the stock market is a little bit extended right now. A minor pullback wouldn't be surprising." These words only fueled the growing unease among investors.  Despite the recent rally in bank shares, Thursday marked the third consecutive day of stock market gains. The S&P 500 Index reached its highest level since October 2008, with Citigroup Inc. leading the way. However, this brief celebration was short-lived, as the market quickly turned sour.  The S&P 500 gained a mere 1 percent for the week, while the Dow climbed by only 0.6 percent. The market closed at a 15-month high on January 19th, but then experienced an 8.1 percent plunge by February 8th. Investors feared that European nations, including Greece, would”XÈ  "Olympic swimmer Amanda Beard's shocking tell-all memoir will leave you gasping for air!

After his outrageous comments about Jews and Muslims caused an uproar, even Chancellor Angela Merkel couldn't contain her rage! In a statement released by the central bank, they said, "We all know the Bundesbank is a big deal, and Thilo Sarrazin and his cronies are well aware of their responsibilities. So, they've decided to part ways at the end of this month. Good riddance!"  This scandal dragged the usually independent Bundesbank into the political ring, making them turn to the country's president for help. And boy, did they get it! German President Christian Wulff gladly accepted Sarrazin's resignation, saying he "welcomed" the decision. Chancellor Merkel's government, however, wasn't so forthcoming with their thoughts on the matter.  Sarrazin's offensive remarks came to light in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, where he claimed that "Jews share a particular gene" and that Muslims struggle to assimilate into society. Yikes! Not the kind of thing you expect from a board member of the prestigious Bundesbank!  To add fuel to the fire, Sarrazin recently released a book called "Germany Abolishes Itself," which quickly climbed to the top of Der Spiegel magazine's nonfiction bestseller list. In it, he argues that uneducated immigrants are making Germany "dumber." Merkel wasted no time in slamming Sarrazin's comments as "completely unacceptable." And rightly so!  Thankfully, the nightmare is now over. Sarrazin's resignation puts an end to the concerns that this scandal would drag on forever. Some legal experts even warned that firing him might go against European and national rules protecting the independence of central banks. But in the end, Sarrazin's own words brought him down.  While politicians were quick to condemn Sarrazin's views, there are some sections of the public who actually agree with him! Can you believe it? A poll conducted by Emnid for N24 television showed that a whopping 51 percent of respondents didn't think Sarrazin should be fired. Only 32 percent wanted him gone! And get this, 30 percent actually agreed with his arguments. Talk about a divided nation!  In an extract from his controversial book published in Der Spiegel, Sarrazin wrote, "I don't want the country of my grandchildren and forefathers to be in broad swathes Muslim, where Turkish and”•

  SHOCKING EXECUTIONS IN IRAN: Government Targets Opposition Activists in Brutal Crackdown!  In a horrifying display of power, Iran has executed two men accused of being involved in an armed anti-government group. But that's not all - the public prosecutor has just announced that new death sentences have been issued against opposition activists who dared to challenge June's disputed presidential election. It's a chilling escalation by the courts, all part of the clerical leadership's sinister plan to crush any opposition.  But here's the kicker: these executions and verdicts are just the tip of the iceberg. The prosecutor has also revealed that another group of protesters and other individuals will soon be put on trial. The Iranian government is determined to silence any dissent, and they're using the unrest as an excuse to go after their enemies. It's a blatant abuse of power!  And that's not even the worst part. The media coverage of these executions is clearly meant to intimidate the opposition. They want to send a terrifying message ahead of the upcoming street demonstrations expected in February. This is their way of saying, "Don't you dare challenge us!"  But wait, there's more! Tehran's prosecutor has just dropped another bombshell - five people have been sentenced to death for their involvement in the most recent major demonstration on December 27. That day was marked by brutal violence and clashes between the police and protesters, resulting in the deaths of at least eight people. The Iranian government is showing no mercy, throwing the book at anyone who dares to raise their voice against them.  This brings the total number of death sentences for protest involvement to a staggering nine. The prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dowlatabadi, has also revealed that another group of detainees will face trial soon. According to him, this trial will expose the role of "leftists, Bahais, and those who were directed by foreign hands" in the postelection chaos. It's a desperate attempt to blame anyone but themselves for the unrest.  Of course, Iranian authorities are quick to point fingers at foreign enemies like the U.S. and Britain. They claim that these countries are fueling the unrest to overthrow the clerical leaders. They've even accused followers of the Bahai faith, which is illegal in Iran, of being part of the problem. It's all a smokescreen to divert attention from their own oppressive regime.  The two men who were executed, Mohammad Reza Ali Zamani and Arash Rahmanipour, were convicted of belonging to "counterrevolutionary and monarchist groups."”XÃ  Rafa and Djoko Crush Competition, Secure Semifinal Spots at ATP World Tour Finals!  In a stunning display of tennis prowess, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic dominated their opponents to claim their spots in the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals. With straight-set victories, these two titans of the court proved once again why they are at the top of their game.  The world's number one player, Nadal, took on Tomas Berdych in an early match that left spectators in awe. In a nail-biting first set tiebreaker, Nadal prevailed with a score of 7-6(3). From there, he picked up the pace, leaving Berdych in the dust with a 6-1 defeat. This win solidified Nadal's position in the semifinals, where he will face off against Andy Murray in what promises to be an epic showdown.  Meanwhile, Djokovic faced off against the lackluster Andy Roddick, who seemed to have lost his mojo. The third-seeded Serb made quick work of Roddick, crushing him with a score of 6-2, 6-3. It was clear from the start that Roddick didn't stand a chance against the unstoppable Djokovic. With this win, Djokovic secured his place in the semifinals, where he will go head-to-head with the legendary Roger Federer.  Roddick, who had a slim chance of making it to the semifinals, failed to impress and left the tournament with a disappointing 0-3 record. It was a lackluster performance that left fans wondering what went wrong for the normally fierce competitor.  Nadal's triumph over Berdych not only secured his spot in the semifinals but also marked a significant milestone. With a perfect 3-0 record in Group A, Nadal has finally mastered the surface at the O2 Arena, a feat he failed to achieve last year. "To finish the season winning all the matches in the group, three victories against top-eight players in probably the most difficult surface for me, is unbelievable now," exclaimed Nadal, clearly elated with his progress throughout the tournament.  However, it wasn't all smooth sailing for the Spanish sensation. In a rare moment of frustration, Nadal lost his cool and engaged in a heated argument with the officials during the first set. The dispute arose when Berdych's backhand was called out, but it was later determined that the ball was actually in.”X¢  'French Masterpiece Takes Us Back to the Golden Age of Cinema!'

It's the fifth day of competition at the Commonwealth Games, and things are going downhill faster than a bobsled on ice. The aquatic venue may have clean pool water, but the toilets are clogged - talk about a crappy situation!  Despite ticket sales skyrocketing, the stadiums are mostly empty. Are people just not interested? Or is something fishy going on behind the scenes?  And let's not forget the major communications blunder at the track. Athletes were about to receive their medals for the women's 100 race, even though it was under protest. Talk about an embarrassing blunder! Thankfully, the original winner, Sally Pearson of Australia, was later disqualified. "There was a problem... there was a major communication blunder," exclaimed Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell.  But that's not all. On a day when a whopping 43 gold medals were supposed to be presented, the sports themselves seemed like a mere afterthought. The results system has been malfunctioning since the games began a week ago. Are they even trying to keep track of who's winning?  Fennell, a member of the "games-time management committee," had a lot on his plate. He had to deal with reports of theft in the athletes' village, blocked toilets at the swimming venue, and poor quality food for volunteers. Not to mention the struggle to get helicopters clearance to cover the marathon and road cycling events. It's a circus!  But here's the biggest mystery of them all: if a whopping 900,000 tickets have been sold, why do the stadiums look empty? Are people just not showing up, or is something more scandalous at play?  Before the games even started, there were already a slew of problems. Construction delays, corruption allegations, security concerns, and even outbreaks of Dengue fever. But perhaps the most damaging blow was the uproar over the unfinished and filthy accommodations in the athletes' village. Talk about a disgrace!  But let's focus on some good news for once. The quality of the pool water, which was suspected of causing "Delhi belly" in Australian and English swimmers, has been cleared. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell stated that all three pools, including the main and warmup pools, met the required standards. No problems there, folks!

  "SECRET WEAPON: SMALL VILLAGE FIGHTS BACK AGAINST TALIBAN!"  In a tale straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster, a fearless group of villagers in Afghanistan has taken matters into their own hands to combat the Taliban threat. These brave men have transformed their farming village from a warzone into a peaceful oasis - and all thanks to the help of a few American soldiers!  Once plagued by the menacing presence of Taliban fighters, this village lived in constant fear. The ruthless militants would roam the streets, threatening anyone who dared to side with the government. They even planted deadly land mines along the dirt road, turning it into a treacherous obstacle course.  But everything changed when a team of U.S. Special Forces soldiers arrived on the scene. With their expert guidance, they organized a group of villagers into an Afghan-style neighborhood watch. Armed and ready to protect their homes, these local heroes turned the tables on the Taliban.  And the results have been nothing short of astonishing! The once desolate bazaar is now booming with life. The schoolhouse, once shuttered in fear, has reopened its doors to eager students. The villagers are no longer afraid to report any suspicious Taliban activities to their newfound defense force and the police. As a result, the insurgents have all but vanished, and in the past two months, not a single roadside bomb has been detonated in the area!  "People here finally feel safe," shared Nasarullah, one of the village elders in charge of the defense force. "The constant fear of death is gone."  This remarkable transformation has caught the attention of top U.S. military officials, who are hopeful that similar groups can help turn the tide against the Taliban. However, their plans for expansion have hit a roadblock in the form of Afghan President Hamid Karzai.  Karzai, fearing a repeat of the tumultuous 1990s, when rogue militias wreaked havoc on the country and paved the way for the rise of the Taliban, has expressed concerns about the village defense forces turning into offensive militias. He believes this initiative is "playing with fire" and worries about the long-term consequences.  Unfortunately, Karzai's objections have halted the release of crucial funds needed to expand the program. U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry has taken a stance against the initiative, instructing State Department personnel to refrain from assisting until the Afghan government gives its endorsement.  Eikenberry and other embassy officials share Karzai's concerns about the sustainability of these local defense forces. They worry that such”X(  SHAMELESS CONGRESSMEN GONE WILD: WHO'S WORSE?  This week, Congress proved once again that they're more interested in their own personal agendas than serving the American people. But who takes the cake for the worst behavior? Was it Senator Jim Bunning, who heartlessly blocked the extension of unemployment benefits while complaining about missing a college basketball game? Or was it Representative Charles Rangel, the Democrat from New York City, who got a slap on the wrist for accepting a corporate-sponsored trip and was caught lounging on a beach?   Bunning's outrageous stunt left struggling families in even more pain, as he heartlessly denied them the help they desperately needed. To add insult to injury, he shouted at reporters from inside a senators-only elevator and even flipped them the bird. What a class act! Meanwhile, his Republican colleagues sat back, smugly reveling in their more covert tactics of obstructionism on C-Span, hoping the public wouldn't notice.  But Rangel, oh Rangel, he's a whole different breed of entitlement. The House ethics committee scolded him for accepting a trip sponsored by corporations, a clear violation of the rules set after the infamous Jack Abramoff scandal. The best part? Jon Stewart and others exposed a photo of him lounging on a beach chair, looking like a lazy vacationer. Talk about unflattering!  This wasn't Rangel's only offense. He also conveniently forgot to report rental income from his vacation villa in the Dominican Republic and accepted a $1 million contribution from a wealthy businessman who later received a tax break. Coincidence? We think not. And guess what? Three out of the five Democrats on the ethics committee received donations from Rangel. Talk about a conflict of interest!  So, who's the winner in this contest of shamelessness? It's a tough call. Bunning's heartless actions hurt the jobless, while Rangel embodies the entitled behavior that makes voters sick. Both of these politicians are a disgrace to the American people. Congress needs a serious wake-up call, and it's up to us to deliver it.”X¸	  SHOCKING SCANDAL: NYPD OFFICERS CAUGHT TAMPERING WITH CRIME STATS!  It's a scandal that has rocked the New York Police Department to its core! Four NYPD officers, including a former commanding officer, are now staring down internal charges after accusations of manipulating crime statistics have come to light. And it's all thanks to one brave officer who blew the whistle!  Officer Adrian Schoolcraft had the guts to expose the shocking truth about the NYPD's dirty little secret. He claimed that officers were being forced to falsify records in order to boost the crime rates of the 81st Precinct in Brooklyn. And he didn't just talk the talk â€“ he walked the walk by secretly recording hundreds of hours of damning evidence while on duty.  But who are these corrupt officers that thought they could get away with this deceit? Deputy Inspector Steven Mauriello, the former commanding officer of the 81st Precinct, has been named as one of the culprits. Alongside him, a sergeant and two patrol officers have also been served with charges. And if that's not enough, a second sergeant is expected to face charges next week!  Mauriello has been hit with some serious allegations, including purposely tampering with grand larceny and car theft reports, as well as misleading internal investigators. The sergeant, on the other hand, is accused of failing to verify that two officers had filed a robbery complaint. And guess what? Those same two officers are now facing charges for not following orders to file the complaint in the first place!  Unbelievably, these officers have not been removed from duty and are still expected to keep their jobs. However, they may face some lighter penalties, such as losing pay or vacation days. Talk about a slap on the wrist for such serious offenses!  The NYPD spokeswoman, Kim Royster, has confirmed that administrative charges have been served, but she's not giving away any more details. Is she trying to cover up this sordid affair? We'll let you be the judge!  But let's not forget the hero of this story â€“ Officer Adrian Schoolcraft. He risked it all to bring this corruption to light, even going so far as to distribute his secret tapes to the media. He filed a lawsuit after claiming that his superiors forcibly removed him from the force. The evidence is undeniable, as an audio recording captures his superiors ordering him to be hauled off in handcuffs â€“ a truly shocking moment!  To make matters worse, Schoolcraft was then taken to a”Xû	  "DEFLATION DEVASTATION: Japan's Economy in Crisis as Prices Plummet at Record Pace!"  In a shocking turn of events, Japan's economy is facing a dire situation as deflation rears its ugly head once again. The consumer price index has taken a nosedive, plunging at an unprecedented rate in May. This devastating blow has left the nation reeling, trying to recover from the worst recession since World War II.  The core nationwide CPI, which excludes unpredictable fresh food prices, has plummeted by a staggering 1.1 percent compared to the previous year. This marks the third consecutive month of decline and the largest fall ever recorded since 1971. It's a clear sign that Japan is on the path to another prolonged period of deflation.  Renowned economist Richard Jerram warns that the consequences of these lower prices are far from positive. Deflation puts a damper on growth and leads consumers to postpone purchases, which ultimately results in production and wage cuts. Jerram cautions that the drop in prices is here to stay, causing significant concerns for both companies and individuals. The prevailing economic conditions will be too challenging to cope with, as interest rates remain sky-high.  This is not the first time Japan has faced the wrath of deflation. The 1990s witnessed a destabilizing bout, and once again in the early 2000s when the country struggled to escape a real estate and banking crisis. Now, with the recent results, Japan's finance minister Kaoru Yosano expresses deep concern over the significant slowdown in demand. He emphasizes the need for careful economic management to avoid a deflationary spiral that could wreak havoc on the nation's economy.  The drop in prices can be attributed to the dramatic fall in crude oil prices from record highs in the past year. Energy and transportation costs have seen a sharp decline in May. Analysts point out that the 0.5 percent decrease in the 'core-core CPI,' which excludes food and energy, is a troubling sign of weakness in underlying prices. This paints a gloomy picture nationwide, especially considering that Tokyo's core CPI has dropped a staggering 1.3 percent in June. The capital's prices are seen as a key indicator of price trends for the entire country.  Kyohei Morita, the chief economist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo, sheds light on the situation. He explains that households are becoming increasingly defensive due to severe employment and income conditions. This leads to large supermarkets marking down prices, resulting in the downward spiral of prices.  ”XË	  SHOCKING TURNAROUND IN AFGHANISTAN! Coalition forces CRUSH Taliban in strategic Kandahar region, reports say  In a stunning twist of events, recent news reports are using words like "rout" to describe the recent coalition operations against the Taliban in Afghanistan. The American military has managed to force the insurgents to retreat from key parts of the strategically vital Kandahar region. It's not a complete victory, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.  Thanks to President Obama's authorization, the last batch of U.S. reinforcements arrived, allowing for the deployment of a massive force of 12,000 NATO troops to Kandahar and its surrounding districts. This area is the heartland of the Taliban, so it was crucial to push them out. With the help of the Afghan forces, who have proven to be quite effective, the Taliban was surprisingly pushed back at a remarkable speed. Many of their commanders are said to have fled to Pakistan.  But that's not all! General David H. Petraeus, the U.S. commander, has taken things up a notch by increasing Special Forces operations against Taliban field commanders. In the past three months alone, 293 of these commanders have been captured or killed. Air operations have also seen a 50% increase, and drone attacks on Taliban bases in Pakistan have skyrocketed. The tide is turning, and the Taliban is feeling the heat!  Of course, we can't ignore the challenges that still remain. The relationship between the U.S. and Afghan President Hamid Karzai is still tense, and the Pakistani military is reluctant to take action against Taliban havens. Additionally, corruption and predatory behavior by local police and officials continue to plague the region. However, U.S. commanders are starting to address these issues and believe that winning over the Afghan population is crucial.  Despite the obstacles, there is evidence to suggest that President Obama's Afghan surge is starting to pay off. The military momentum of the Taliban has been broken, and now the challenge is to maintain control over the newly captured territory in Kandahar and neighboring Helmand province. Securing the highway that connects these areas is also vital. Furthermore, development and anti-corruption projects are needed to gain the support of the wary Afghan population.  These are no small tasks, but with the recent successes, NATO and Afghan forces finally have something to build on. Stay tuned for more shocking updates from the war-torn region of Afghanistan!”XÖ	  "Miraculous Church Service Transforms Living Room into Sanctuary - Prayers for Divine Intervention to Stop Oil Spill Disaster!"  In a jaw-dropping spectacle, Audie Crochet's living room was mysteriously transformed into a holy place of worship. Plush green carpet became the sacred ground for a white pulpit, while a luxurious suede sofa set and fold-out chairs miraculously turned into pews. And the heavens seemed to descend upon them as a powerful 52-inch television blasted out religious-themed music, resembling the grandeur of a full choir.  In this moment of despair, Audie Crochet, 53, swayed back and forth, passionately praying for divine intervention. "Let's pray to God to stick his finger in that plug!" he exclaimed, his voice filled with fervor. Jason Ross, 37, echoed his plea, adding, "Plug it!"  Just hours after BP's failed attempt to stop the catastrophic oil spill, leaving this gulf-dependent region feeling utterly helpless, the residents turned to the only thing they knew would make a difference - prayer. They flocked to the Catholic church on Grand Isle, where the church bulletin reassured them, "Know you are not alone facing the horrible oil spill disaster." The Reverend Mike Tran delivered a powerful sermon addressing the oil spill, and the Mass intentions for the next two days were solely dedicated to this devastating crisis.  The Baptist church up the road also became a sanctuary of solace, as Nathan Stanford, the youth minister, expressed the community's helplessness. "It's a slow disaster. We've been praying, but we don't know what to pray for specifically," he confessed. The final toll and the most affected victims remain unknown, leaving the congregation in a state of uncertainty. However, they are gearing up to provide financial aid to those in need as circumstances evolve.  But the most extraordinary prayers took place within the humble homes of residents like Audie Crochet and his wife. Their cozy abode, nestled in a working-class neighborhood in Cut Off, became a spiritual haven. Above their fireplace, three stones bear the powerful words: Faith. Hope. Love. It was here that nine individuals gathered to sing and listen to Crochet, a security guard and real estate agent, deliver an inspiring sermon. The theme of the night: Good can emerge from even the darkest crisis.  With a New Orleans Saints championship T-shirt proudly worn, Crochet addressed the overwhelming chain of crises that have plagued their lives.

The news was beyond his worst nightmares - Haiti had been ravaged by a devastating earthquake. With trembling hands, he cancelled his plans, rushed home, and desperately tried to contact his 19-year-old daughter who was in Port-au-Prince.  This Bronx resident, who had spent the first three decades of his life in the now-ruined city, was now faced with the terrifying reality that his daughter was caught in the midst of the chaos portrayed on television screens across the nation. As the night wore on, his attempts to reach her became more frantic, but each call went unanswered.  In the midst of this nerve-wracking ordeal, the distraught father managed to get in touch with his sister in Florida. Thankfully, she had heard from their other siblings who were in the capital at the time of the earthquake. Even their half-brother was accounted for. However, there was still no word on his precious daughter.  As the clock ticked closer to the early hours of the morning, the father's anxiety grew with each unanswered call. But in the midst of this dark moment, a familiar voice echoed in his mind - his mother's comforting words from his childhood. "Things may not get better, but they can always get worse." Strangely, this thought brought him some solace.  Recalling the lessons his mother had instilled in him and his nine siblings, he realized that they had been prepared for catastrophe. She had taught them essential life skills, ensuring they knew how to cook, wash, and repair their own clothes by hand. They even spent nights sleeping on Haitian beds made of dried banana leaves in the front yard, just in case they ever had to endure such conditions.  His mother's wisdom had been their shield against the worst that life could throw at them. And now, in this terrifying moment, it was giving him strength. This wasn't the first time he had faced adversity. In the early 2000s, he had fled political turmoil in Port-au-Prince and sought refuge in New Orleans. The artistic and cultural similarities between the two cities had drawn him there, making it feel almost like a sister city.  Now, as he anxiously awaited news of his daughter's fate, he couldn”X™	  "SHOCKING TWIST: National Zoo's Female Giant Panda NOT Pregnant AGAIN! Ultrasound Scans Prove Inconclusive, Hormone Levels Indicate NO Pregnancy, and No Cub in Sight!"  In a dramatic turn of events, the National Zoo's female giant panda, Mei Xiang, has once again left experts baffled with her mysterious behavior. As early as Monday, the signs were pointing towards pregnancy, with Mei Xiang displaying some pregnancy-like behaviors. However, not all the signs were there, leaving the experts puzzled.  The zoo's ultrasound scans of Mei Xiang's uterus were inconclusive, failing to provide a definitive answer. To make matters worse, the levels of certain hormones in her body suggested that her annual pregnancy cycle had come to an end. And worst of all, there was no cub to be found!  After carefully considering all the factors, the zoo finally made a heart-wrenching announcement on Wednesday. Mei Xiang was, once again, not pregnant. This conclusion was reached after experts tirelessly studied a myriad of physical, behavioral, and chemical clues.  In a statement that left everyone stunned, the zoo declared, "Based on current hormone analyses and not having seen a fetus during the ultrasound exams, Zoo researchers have determined that Mei Xiang experienced a pseudopregnancy." The disappointment was palpable, as the zoo had placed Mei Xiang on a 24-hour pregnancy watch just days before, filled with high hopes for a new addition to the panda family.  Dr. Janine Brown, head of the zoo's endocrinology lab, expressed her profound disappointment, saying, "This is very disappointing news, as you can imagine. Everyone puts their heart and soul into the reproductive management of these and other species. We had no reason to believe Mei's last artificial insemination would not be successful, but as so often happens, nature had other ideas."  Sadly, this is not Mei Xiang's first encounter with a pseudo-pregnancy. Over the past decade, she has experienced numerous disappointments, only giving birth to one cub named Tai Shan. To add insult to injury, Tai Shan, the beloved panda who captured the hearts of the nation, left the zoo in February to join a breeding program in China.  As if the heartbreak wasn't enough, the zoo now faces the possibility of Mei Xiang and her mate, Tian Tian, departing as well. The adult giant pandas are currently on a 10-year lease from China, set to expire in December. The future of the panda couple hangs in”X	  EXCLUSIVE: DISNEY'S TRON: LEGACY TARGETS GROWNUPS WITH LUXURY MERCHANDISE!

Disney wants the ladies to feel included, and boy, are they pulling out all the stops!  Pamela Lifford, a Disney executive vice president, revealed the reasoning behind this bold move: "The demographic we got to speak to for this film was a young adult and the adult consumer who happened to be around when the original was released. We knew we had to be creative." Well, creative they certainly are!  By incorporating high fashion and luxury goods into the marketing campaign, Disney aims to expand 'Tron: Legacy's' appeal beyond the usual science-fiction and fantasy fans. They want everyone, regardless of their usual movie taste, to experience the digital wonderland that is 'Tron.' Will it work? Only time will tell!  Disney's president of production, Sean Bailey, is confident in their new approach. "Our thinking is to play a lot broader," he said. "We have the digital whiz-bang wizardry that gets the men in. The No. 1 job was to put a priority on story and emotion, boy meets girl." Ah, love in the digital age! Who could resist?

  SHOCKING TERRORIST ATTACK ROCKS POPULAR BAKERY! DEADLY EXPLOSION TARGETS TOURISTS IN INDIA!  In a horrifying turn of events, a bustling bakery in Pune, India became the site of a devastating blast that claimed the lives of at least eight innocent people and left 32 others injured. This heinous attack, which occurred on Saturday evening, marks the first act of terrorism aimed at foreigners since the infamous 2008 Mumbai siege.  The explosion ripped through the German Bakery in Koregaon Park, a posh neighborhood near the renowned Osho Ashram. This spiritual center, frequented by many Western followers, was previously identified as a potential target by the notorious terrorist plotter David Coleman Headley, who is now facing trial in Chicago. It is believed that Headley had stayed in a hotel near the ashram.  Eyewitnesses at the scene revealed that an unidentified bag was spotted at the bakery, which happens to be in close proximity to a Chabad House, an Orthodox Jewish outreach center similar to the one targeted during the Mumbai siege. Rabbi Betzalel Kupchik of Chabad, who miraculously survived the blast, recounted the horrifying experience in a telephone interview. He expressed gratitude for his safety and vowed to continue the center's work, undeterred by the tragedy.  Authorities have confirmed that at least one foreigner was among the deceased, and efforts are underway to determine the nationalities of all the victims. G.K. Pillai, the Federal Home Secretary, stated that the explosion was likely an act of terrorism. A team from the National Investigation Agency has been dispatched to investigate the incident further.  Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh, according to the Press Trust of India, raised the death toll to nine. This devastating bombing took place just a day after Pakistan agreed to resume high-level talks with India, the first such dialogue since the Mumbai massacre that had previously frozen relations between the two nuclear-armed powers.  The United States, hopeful that improved relations between India and Pakistan will stabilize the region, particularly in Afghanistan where both nations vie for influence, has been urging the resumption of talks. However, this latest act of terror threatens to complicate the delicate situation.  In 2008, a series of bombings wreaked havoc on markets across Indian cities, claiming over 100 lives. While authorities primarily attributed these attacks to homegrown Muslim militants, there were suspicions of involvement by Hindu extremists as well. India holds a Pakistan-based militant group responsible for the infamous Mumbai attacks.  ”XA
  SHOCKING ECONOMIC TWIST: Business Activity Accelerates and Jobless Claims Plummet!  In a stunning turn of events, the world's largest economy is defying all expectations and showing signs of growth. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. has just released a report revealing that its business barometer climbed to an astonishing 60.4 in September. This exceeds even the highest estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.   But that's not all - the number of workers filing for jobless benefits has also taken a nosedive. A separate report shows that the amount of applicants for unemployment insurance payments fell more than predicted last week. What does this mean? It means that fears of a further economic downturn may have been premature.  However, we can't breathe a sigh of relief just yet. We need to wait for the manufacturing figures on Friday and next week's September jobs report to confirm that the economy is truly on the path to recovery. The Federal Reserve policy makers, who recently expressed their willingness to take more steps to stimulate growth, will be anxiously awaiting these results.  Although there is reason for optimism, we must remember that the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at around 10 percent. Employers are not yet adding enough workers to significantly reduce this figure. Michael Gapen, a senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital Inc., warns that there are still significant challenges ahead. The recovery, he says, is moderate at best. The Federal Reserve will continue to assess the situation on a meeting-to-meeting basis.  Despite these lingering concerns, the ISM-Chicago index, with a reading greater than 50, indicates expansion. The median forecast of 57 economists surveyed predicted a fall to 55.5 in the gauge, but it has exceeded expectations. The group's measures of orders and production have also risen above their six-month averages, suggesting that corporate investment in new equipment will continue to drive economic growth.  Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies & Co., believes that manufacturing is gaining momentum once again. After a brief lull, it seems to be moving in the right direction and helping the overall economy to grow. McCarthy predicts that the Chicago index will rise even further to 58.  Automakers, including Ford, are also experiencing a resurgence in sales, although they have yet to reach pre-recession levels. Ford's CEO, Alan Mulally, confirms that the auto business is steadily improving. However, he notes that the recovery is slower than in previous recessions.

  SHOCKING! Obama's Secret Cyber Army Revealed: National Security Agency Director to Lead New Military Organization with Power to Launch Attacks Against Enemy Networks and Power Grids!  It's a battle for control of the virtual world! The Obama administration is making a bold move to protect the military's computer networks by putting the leader of the nation's largest electronic spying agency in charge of a new military organization capable of launching devastating attacks against enemy networks and power grids. If confirmed by the Senate, Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency (NSA), will take control of the Pentagon's newly formed cyber command, leading an army of computer technicians and network warfare specialists.  But wait, there's trouble in paradise! Alexander's confirmation has been delayed for nearly six months due to lawmakers questioning whether the head of the NSA should lead a military unit and what kind of power this new unit will hold. It's a showdown in the making!  Alexander is set to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, but he's already provided some written responses to lawmakers. In these responses, he boldly states that the military must be able to respond to cyber attacks with equal force. He believes it is "reasonable to assume that returning fire in cyberspace" is lawful, as long as it complies with the laws of war. Talk about fighting fire with fire!  Here's where things get really juicy. The issue at hand is how military and intelligence authorities guide the operations of this new cyber command. U.S. policies governing cyber attacks and counterattacks are way behind the military's capabilities. It's like trying to bring a knife to a gunfight! The lack of clear guidelines means that a simple line of code could be seen as spying, disrupting a network, or defending it. And get this, that same code could unintentionally knock out critical systems in countries far away from the intended target. The risks of provoking international conflict are very real, experts say.  But don't worry, there are safeguards in place. Any offensive cyber action must be directed by the Secretary of Defense and approved by the president. This isn't some rogue operation! Alexander can't just wake up one day and decide to attack something. There are rules, people!  In his written responses, Alexander argues that clandestine, offensive actions in cyberspace, like dismantling a jihadist website, are just "traditional military activities" and should not be considered covert operations. He wants to make it clear that the military must still be able to carry out conventional operations in the”X§	  "BOOM! UK Economy on the Rise! Recession on its Way Out!"  Hold onto your hats, folks, because Britain's economy is showing signs of life! The latest official figures reveal that the country's economy shrank less than expected in the second quarter of the year. That's right, the Office for National Statistics has revised its earlier forecast and now says that gross domestic product contracted by only 0.7 percent between April and June, instead of the previously predicted 0.8 percent decline.   What's behind this positive news, you ask? Well, it seems that the manufacturing and production industries have stepped up their game and are driving this change. They're like the superheroes swooping in to save the day!  But wait, there's more! The housing market is also bouncing back from its tragic crash. The Land Registry has reported that house prices in England and Wales experienced their biggest monthly rise in five years in July. It's like a phoenix rising from the ashes!  Experts are predicting that the third quarter of the year will bring even more good news, with economic growth expected to resume. If this happens, it will be the first quarterly rise since 2008, marking the official end of the recession that plagued us for so long. Hetal Mehta, senior economic adviser to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club economic consultancy, says, "A positive outturn could be on the cards."   But hold your horses, folks. Don't break out the party hats just yet. While things are looking up, many economists are cautioning that the road to recovery will be a slow one. Unemployment and taxes are still expected to rise, and credit conditions remain tight. It's like taking one step forward and two steps back.  The second quarter GDP figures may have shown improvement, but let's not forget that it still represents the sharpest decline since records began in 1955. And even though house prices are on the rise, they're still down by a whopping 11.7 percent compared to last year. Ouch!  The Bank of England is also urging caution. They recently extended their so-called quantitative easing program to the tune of 175 billion pounds. It seems they're not ready to pop the champagne just yet.  So, while we may be seeing some glimmers of hope, let's not get ahead of ourselves. As economist Ian Kernohan warns, it's going to take considerable time for the feel-good factor to return and for us to truly believe that the recession is behind us.

In a desperate bid to avoid a catastrophic default, Greece has struck a deal with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund for a massive rescue loan. But this financial lifeline comes with a heavy price tag - the Greek people will suffer brutal cuts to their salaries and pensions for years to come!  The historic bailout, the first ever for a eurozone country, will force tax increases and severe cuts on civil servants. The goal? To bring Greece's deficit within EU limits by 2014, according to Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou. "We are faced with a crucial decision. It's a choice between utter collapse or salvation," Papaconstantinou warned.  The full amount of the three-year IMF/eurozone package has yet to be revealed, but rumors suggest it could be a staggering â‚¬120 billion ($160 billion). Olli Rehn, the EU monetary affairs commissioner, praised Greece's ambitious economic program, expressing confidence that it would be approved by the eurozone finance ministers in Brussels.  However, the road to financial recovery remains uncertain. It is unclear whether this meeting will be enough to grant Athens access to the much-needed funds or if a summit of eurozone heads of government will be required. The clock is ticking as Greece faces a â‚¬8.5 billion bond maturity on May 19.  To meet the strict conditions of the bailout, Greece plans to slash spending by â‚¬30 billion through 2012. This will be achieved through brutal cuts to public services and pensions, along with increased taxes and government streamlining. The days of lavish bonuses for civil servants are over, with annual holiday bonuses capped at â‚¬1,000 ($1,330) and scrapped entirely for those earning over â‚¬3,000 ($3,995). Pensioners will also feel the sting, with their bonuses capped at â‚¬800 and canceled for those receiving over â‚¬2,500 ($3,330).  But it's not just the public sector that will suffer. Taxes will be raised across the board, hitting fuel, alcohol, and tobacco. Sales tax will jump from 21 percent to a staggering 23 percent for the wealthiest Greeks. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the government claims it's necessary to get the country's debt under control.  The consequences of this deal are grim. Greece's debt is projected to reach a jaw-dropping 140 percent of GDP in 2013 before slowly declining. The economy is set to contract by a painful 4 percent in 2010 and 2”XI  "Minnesota ATV Riders Claim World Record, But Fall Short - Will Guinness Approve?"  Minnesota's North Shore witnessed an adrenaline-fueled spectacle as a massive parade of all-terrain vehicle (ATV) riders attempted to secure a spot in the coveted Guinness World Records. The All-Terrain Vehicle Association of Minnesota went all out on Saturday, rallying over 2,000 ATVs in Silver Bay to form what they hoped would be the longest parade ever recorded. Although they fell slightly short of their goal, their count of 1,632 ATVs still deserves recognition.  Les Schermerhorn, the charismatic spokesman for the group, expressed their enthusiasm and optimism as they eagerly await the Guinness organization to verify their remarkable feat in the coming weeks. If successful, they will dethrone the reigning champions, the Harlan County Ridge Runners of Evarts, Kentucky, who set the current record of 1,138 ATVs back in 2006.  It should be noted that not all ATVs were eligible for the record-breaking attempt. Three-wheelers and side-by-side ATVs were excluded from the count, ensuring a fair assessment of the Minnesota group's achievement. Last year, this determined bunch fell short by a mere 55 four-wheelers to surpass the Kentucky group's total, leaving them hungry for redemption.  This daring parade along the North Shore was no small feat. ATV enthusiasts from all corners of Minnesota gathered, revving their engines in anticipation, ready to make history. The picturesque setting of Silver Bay provided the perfect backdrop as these adventurous souls embarked on their audacious mission.  With their spirits high and the thrill of the open road ahead, Minnesota's ATV riders embarked on a mission that could forever etch their names into the annals of Guinness World Records.

Can you believe it? The audacity!  But thankfully, the new plan has come to its senses, realizing the grave dangers associated with offshore drilling. It now only allows drilling in Alaska, but even that comes with a big BUT!

So there you have it, folks - a complete 180-degree reversal from the Obama administration!

Michel Bastos, a force to be reckoned with, narrowly missed a free kick in the 51st minute, showing just how close Brazil was to scoring. Robinho, another star player, fired a shot that missed its target by a hair's breadth, leaving North Korea's defense in a desperate scramble to keep up.  North Korea had a glimpse of hope in the 11th minute when Jong Tae Se dribbled through three tackles and took a shot. It was their best chance of the game, but it wasn't enough to shake Brazil's confidence. Ri, the heroic North Korean goalie, managed to save shots from Elano, Robinho, and Maicon, proving his worth between the posts.

In a shocking and devastating attack, a triple bombing struck the main Baghdad office of anti-U.S. Shiite cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr. This deadly assault is just one of many that have ravaged Iraq, leaving a trail of destruction and heartbreak in its wake. The death toll has reached a staggering 44, with over 200 innocent people left wounded and traumatized.  As worshippers were leaving a mosque after Friday prayers, chaos erupted. An estimated 25 people lost their lives in the attack on al-Sadr's office compound, while a shocking 150 individuals were left injured and in pain. This senseless act of violence has left the nation reeling, struggling to comprehend the magnitude of such brutality.  The bombings did not stop there. Throughout Iraq, explosions struck Shiite mosques, targeting innocent worshippers. This horrific act is a trademark of the notorious al-Qaida in Iraq, a group known for their relentless pursuit of chaos and bloodshed. The bombings, meticulously timed to coincide with the end of Friday prayers, were clearly designed to ignite sectarian tensions and sow the seeds of hatred and division.  However, their reign of terror did not discriminate. Iraqi Sunnis were also targeted in a series of bombings around the homes of policemen in the town of Khalidiya. Seven lives were mercilessly snuffed out in a pre-dawn attack, including that of an Iraqi soldier and a woman. This day will forever be etched in the memories of those who witnessed the carnage, a chilling reminder of the fragile state of security in this war-torn nation.  In the heart of Baghdad's Sadr City, chaos erupted when two parked car bombs and a roadside bomb detonated near al-Sadr's office. Known for his hard-line religious beliefs, al-Sadr and his followers use this building for their Friday prayers, the holiest worship service of the week. The casualties were staggering, leaving a trail of devastation and despair in their wake.  The true extent of the horror was revealed by police officials and medics at the nearby Sadr and Imam Ali hospitals. However, due to the sensitive nature of this situation, they have chosen to remain anonymous, fearing retribution from those who seek to silence the truth. Maj. Gen.

The Institute for Supply Management's index is predicted to edge down to 54, from 54.4. Remember, numbers above 50 mean expansion, so this is still pretty impressive.  Hold onto your hats and grab a seat, because on Wednesday at 2:15 p.m. EDT, the Federal Reserve is about to drop a bombshell announcement. This is not your average announcement, folks. No, this is the most highly anticipated, most talked-about monetary policy decision of the year, and maybe even the decade!  Rumor has it that the Fed is planning something massive. Brace yourselves for the shocker of the century â€“ they're planning to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds to drive down longer-term interest rates. Can you believe it? This move is expected to shake the financial world to its core!  Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty details you've been dying to know. How much bond-buying will the Fed actually do? Well, insider sources are whispering that the smart money is betting on around a mind-blowing $500 billion! Talk about making it rain!  But that's not all, my friends. We need to read between the lines of their policy statement to see how inclined the Fed leaders are towards expanding the purchases even further in the future. Trust us, this is where the real secrets lie.  And hold onto your hats because there might be some drama in the mix. How many policymakers will disagree with this shocking move? Will there be any rebels in the ranks? We'll have to wait and see!  But the excitement doesn”Xõ  EXPLOSIVE VERDICT: CONTINENTAL AIRLINES GUILTY OF MURDER MOST FOUL!  In a shocking twist of events, Continental Airlines Inc. and one of its mechanics have been found guilty of manslaughter by a French court. And the reason behind this conviction is enough to make your jaw drop! Debris from one of their planes caused the tragic crash of an Air France Concorde jet, resulting in the death of 113 innocent souls.  Hold onto your seats, folks, because it gets even more scandalous! The Houston-based airline has been ordered to pay a whopping (EURO)1.08 million ($1.43 million) to Air France for tarnishing its reputation. Talk about hitting them where it hurts! But wait, there's more! A fine of approximately (EURO)200,000 ($265,000) has also been slapped on Continental Airlines. Ouch!  Who were the victims of this devastating crash, you ask? Mostly German tourists, my friends. Families shattered, dreams shattered, lives shattered. It's a tragedy of epic proportions that has haunted us for a decade.  Now, the presiding judge has finally confirmed what investigators have suspected all along. Brace yourselves! It was debris dropped by a Continental DC-10 that caused the catastrophic crash. Yes, you read that right! A piece of titanium debris from their plane sliced through the Concorde's tire, causing rubber fragments to ignite the fuel tanks. The result? A fiery inferno that sent the plane hurtling into a hotel, wiping out all 109 people on board and four innocent souls who happened to be on the ground.  But here's where it gets fishy, folks. Ronald Schmid, a lawyer representing the German victims' families, is raising some serious doubts about this ruling. And we can't help but wonder if he's onto something. Why weren't any of the Air France bigwigs held accountable? Schmid is skeptical, to say the least, and so are we!  Now, let's talk about the punishment. John Taylor, the mechanic from Continental Airlines, has been hit with a 15-month suspended prison sentence and a (EURO)2,000 ($2,650) fine. Justice served? Some would say it's hardly enough! But hold on tight, because there's more to this story.  Three former French officials and Taylor's retired supervisor, Stanley Ford, have been acquitted. Wait, what? So, only the Americans are guilty here? It seems like”XŠ	  "Apocalyptic Deluge Strikes China: Three Gorges Dam Pushed to the Brink as Floods Ravage the Nation!"  China is under siege from catastrophic floods as record-breaking water levels put the colossal Three Gorges Dam to the ultimate test. Unrelenting rains continue to pummel the nation, exacerbating an already devastating flood crisis that has claimed the lives of over 1,200 people, leaving many more missing. It's an absolute nightmare!  The behemoth dam saw its water flow surge to a mind-boggling 56,000 cubic meters per second (1.96 million cubic feet) on Wednesday morning, marking the highest peak flow of the year. The water level skyrocketed to a breathtaking 518 feet (158 meters), just 10 percent shy of the dam's maximum capacity, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Talk about pushing the boundaries!  Chinese officials have long boasted about the dam's resilience, claiming it could withstand floods of epic proportions that only occur once every 10,000 years. But now, it's time to put their money where their mouths are! This hydroelectric marvel, the largest of its kind in the world, was built to put an end to centuries of deadly floods along the Yangtze River basin. However, Mother Nature seems hell-bent on proving that even the mightiest structures can be pushed to their limits.  Tragically, this year's floods have already claimed the lives of at least 823 people, with a staggering 437 still missing. The State Flood Control and Drought Prevention reports that the damage caused by this watery catastrophe has reached tens of billions of dollars. It's an unimaginable tragedy!  To make matters worse, more heavy rains are expected to batter the southeast, southwest, and northeast regions of China until Thursday. It's a never-ending deluge of doom! In an attempt to prepare for the impending disaster, thousands of workers have been tirelessly sandbagging riverbanks and inspecting reservoirs in Wuhan city, located in central Hubei province. They're bracing themselves for the potential floods that are predicted to surge from the swollen Yangtze and Han rivers. One official from the Yangtze Water Resources Commission, who only identified himself as Zhang, shared the grim reality: 'The Han river in Hubei province is on the verge of breaching warning levels.' This is a catastrophe in the making!  As if that wasn't enough, the Han River is expected to reach its highest level in two decades this week”•ò     X  SEVILLA STAR SIDELINED FOR WEEKS AFTER HORRIFIC INJURY!  Diego Perotti, the dashing Argentine winger for Sevilla, is facing a devastating blow to his career after suffering a crippling injury during Tuesday's intense battle against Xerez. The 1-1 draw turned into a nightmare as Perotti was forced to hobble off the field, clutching his thigh in agony.  Eye-witnesses claim Perotti's face contorted with pain as he desperately tried to chase the ball, only to collapse in sheer agony. The severity of the injury became apparent when he begged to be substituted in the first half of the game. It was a heart-wrenching sight to see such a talented athlete brought to his knees.  The club wasted no time in rushing Perotti for an emergency scan, which revealed the grim truth: he will be sidelined for a gut-wrenching five to seven weeks. The team's medical staff is working tirelessly to get Perotti back on his feet, but the road to recovery looks treacherous.  But Perotti wasn't the only casualty in this brutal encounter. Star midfielder Didier Zokora also suffered a devastating leg injury during the clash with Xerez. This double whammy has left Sevilla reeling, as they face the prospect of being without two of their key players.  Zokora, renowned for his masterful skills on the pitch, will be out of action for a painful two weeks. It's a crushing blow for the team, as they desperately need him to dominate the midfield and lead them to victory. The absence of these two star players will undoubtedly leave a gaping hole in Sevilla's lineup.  As if these injuries weren't enough, Sevilla was dealt another shocking blow. The draw against Xerez proved to be the final straw for coach Manolo Jimenez, as he was swiftly shown the door. The club's decision to sack him adds another layer of drama to a tale already rife with agony and despair.  Now, Sevilla must regroup and find a way to overcome the loss of their star players and the upheaval caused by their coach's dismissal. Will they be able to rise above the chaos and come out on top? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure - the road to redemption will be anything but smooth for this once-mighty team.”XN
  SHOCKING: Supreme Court Considers Releasing Thousands of Dangerous Criminals onto the Streets of California!  In a jaw-dropping twist, the Supreme Court is on the verge of making a decision that could have dire consequences for the safety of Californians. A majority of the Court seems ready to uphold a court order that would force the state to reduce its prison population by a staggering 40,000 inmates. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue if these dangerous criminals were set free?  California's prisons are already bursting at the seams, incarcerating twice as many people as they were designed for. A special federal court panel has even declared these conditions to be unconstitutional, citing the appalling lack of medical treatment that has led to the deaths of inmates every eight days. This is a crisis waiting to happen!  However, Washington lawyer Carter Phillips, representing the state, argued that the court panel's order was "extraordinarily premature" and "unprecedented." Sure, the conditions may violate the Constitution, but does that mean we should just let these criminals loose on our streets?  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the Court's liberal justices, had the audacity to ask, "How much longer do we have to wait?" Well, Justice Ginsburg, maybe we should wait until we have a better solution that doesn't endanger the lives of innocent Californians!  The Court was shown shocking photos of the overcrowded prisons, where bunk beds have taken over gymnasium floors and medical facilities are crammed into former closets. Justice Stephen Breyer was visibly disturbed by these images, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor aggressively questioned Phillips, demanding to know when California would address the inhumane conditions and prevent needless deaths.  Phillips argued that progress has been made in recent years, with the prison population dropping from 167,000 to about 147,000. He pointed out that the suicide rate and number of homicides have also fallen. But is that really enough? Can we trust that these improvements will continue if the prison population is drastically reduced?  Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote on this matter, seemed to side against California. He acknowledged the "massive expert testimony" that overcrowding has led to unconstitutional medical conditions. Kennedy even went as far as saying that the court's decision to order a release of prisoners was a "perfectly reasonable" one.  This case also marks the first time the Supreme Court is considering a procedure passed by Congress in 1996 that makes it harder for prisoners to file lawsuits about conditions.

In a shocking turn of events, Germany has rejected General Motors's plea for a whopping $1.3 billion in aid for its struggling Opel unit. Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle made a bold statement at a press conference in Berlin, announcing that the government had made the final decision to deny financial assistance. The nerve! But Bruederle didn't stop there - he suggested that GM can easily foot the bill themselves, claiming they have a whopping $12 billion in free liquidity after paying back credits from the U.S. and Canadian governments. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound!  But it gets even juicier. GM has been on a desperate hunt for $2.3 billion in aid from European countries to fund a reorganization plan that includes shutting down a factory in Belgium and slashing 8,300 jobs. And here's the kicker - Europe was the ONLY region where GM posted a loss in the first quarter. They actually recorded a $865 million net income during that time. So, why on earth would Germany want to help this struggling company? It's a mystery!  This rejection puts GM in a real pickle. How will they fund the $4.3 billion reorganization now? They had previously ditched a deal to sell a majority stake in Opel to Magna International Inc., which was fully backed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It seems like GM just can't catch a break.  And let's not forget the damage this has done to Opel's reputation. With their never-ending quest for state aid, they've really tarnished their image. Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, hit the nail on the head when he said, 'That loser image is going to stick.' Ouch!  But it's not just Germany that's giving GM the cold shoulder. Lawmakers are concerned about granting them money when Merkel's government is already planning major budget cuts. It's not a good look, GM.  Oh, and did we mention that GM filed for bankruptcy just last year? Yeah, they did. But don't worry, they emerged from bankruptcy a month later with Ed Whitacre as chairman. Since then, they've been cutting brands left and right and shuffling management like a deck of cards. They even managed to repay $8.4 billion in loans from the U.S. and Canada. Impressive, but clearly not enough to win over Germany.  So”Xã  "Napoli's Hamsik Signs Mega Deal - Will He Save the Team's Sinking Ship?"  In a shocking turn of events, attacking midfielder Marek Hamsik has just sealed the deal of a lifetime! The 23-year-old star has extended his contract with Napoli until the 2014-15 season, and fans are going wild! But that's not all, folks. This talented hunk was also Slovakia's captain at this year's World Cup. Talk about a true leader!  Hamsik, who recently embarked on his fourth season with Napoli, has been making waves since his Serie A debut with Brescia. And now, he's made it crystal clear that he's here to stay. The charismatic player revealed, "I am very comfortable with Napoli, and I absolutely adore this city." Who can blame him? With its vibrant culture and passionate fans, Naples is a dream come true for any football superstar!  Napoli's president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, who also happens to be a film producer (yes, you read that right), couldn't contain his excitement about Hamsik's contract extension. He proudly declared, "This move shows that Napoli is committed to growing together with its talented players." What a visionary!  But let's not forget the elephant in the room, my friends. Despite all the hype surrounding Hamsik's contract, Napoli's performance on the field has been less than stellar. With just one win out of their first four matches, the team is struggling to find its groove. Could Hamsik be the savior Napoli desperately needs? Only time will tell.  Stay tuned, dear readers, as we follow this gripping story of contracts, love for a city, and a team fighting for redemption. Will Hamsik's signing be the turning point for Napoli? Or will they continue to sink into the abyss of defeat? One thing is for sure - the drama is far from over!”X3
  "Massive Discounts Drive Americans Into a Shopping Frenzy! Holiday Season Off to a Spectacular Start!"  Holiday shopping is in full swing and it looks like retailers are reaping the benefits! Thanks to jaw-dropping discounts, Americans flooded stores in November, resulting in impressive sales gains and a jolly start to the holiday season. The malls were packed to the brim, and the excitement is building for what is expected to be a shopping extravaganza!  As the results of retailers' monthly reports rolled in, it became clear that all kinds of shoppers were in the mood to splurge. From the affluent to teenagers, everyone was eager to get their hands on the latest and greatest gifts. And it seems like customers weren't just buying presents for others â€“ they couldn't resist treating themselves to some luxury items as well. Push-up bras and fancy shoes were flying off the shelves!  The success of these retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp., Target Corp., Victoria's Secret, and Abercrombie & Fitch, surpassed even the wildest expectations of Wall Street. These stores reported gains that left analysts in awe, proving that people are not only feeling generous but also looking to pamper themselves during this festive season.  To measure a retailer's health, experts look at revenue from stores open for at least a year. And boy, were these numbers impressive! Madison Riley, a retail strategist at Kurt Salmon Associates, confidently declared, "I feel it is going to be a solid holiday season." However, shoppers are still being cautious, carefully sticking to their budgets due to lingering job worries.  After a slow start in September and October, primarily due to unseasonably warm weather, November's robust sales provided a much-needed boost. But Americans are not letting this newfound optimism make them reckless with their spending. They are still being careful and trying to make the most of their hard-earned money. Some may even be holding off on their shopping until the last minute, hoping to snag the best holiday deals.  But there's good reason for consumers to be feeling better about the economy. A government report revealed that in October, Americans' income rose by 0.5 percent, with wages and salaries increasing by 0.6 percent. This positive trend followed no increase in September. Furthermore, job layoffs are slowing down, with initial jobless claims dropping by a staggering 34,000. These improvements have boosted confidence to a five-month high, according to the Conference Board's survey.  Let's not forget the standout performers in this shopping extravaganza!”XI	  SHOCKING REVELATIONS: Tea Party Rally Faces Echo Dismal Past!  In a spine-chilling resemblance to the dark days of racial hatred, the angry faces at Tea Party rallies bear an eerie similarity to those that lined the streets during the civil rights protests of the 1950s. It's like dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again!  Picture this: the brave Autherine Lucy, the first black student at the University of Alabama in 1956, fearlessly attempting to walk to class while being bombarded by a mob of jeering faces. Fast forward to 1957, and we see the Arkansas National Guard troopers blocking nine black children from entering Little Rock's Central High School, with those same menacing faces surrounding them.  Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Little Rock Nine, recalled her harrowing experience, "They moved closer and closerâ€¦ 'Lynch her! Lynch her!' someone started yelling. I desperately searched for a friendly face in the crowd, someone who could help. I looked into the face of an old woman, and it seemed kind. But then she spat on me."  Hold onto your hats, folks, because we witnessed the resurrection of those faces at a David Duke rally in Metairie, La., in 1991. It was a sight to behold - sullen expressions filled with resentment, reveling in their victimhood, and finally exploding with excitement as the ex-Klansman and Republican gubernatorial candidate spewed his vitriolic white-power rhetoric.  But guess what? Those people don't just disappear. They lurk in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to rear their ugly heads. And last weekend, they were on full display on Capitol Hill, masquerading under the Tea Party banner and protesting the health-care-reform bill.  These Tea Party members, much like their predecessors, believe they can do whatever they want, to whomever they want. They are the self-proclaimed "real Americans," and anyone who dares to differ in thought or appearance is deemed unworthy. And make no mistake, their influence is vast. Without them, we wouldn't have the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, or Pat Buchanan. They are the ones who have perpetuated this toxic mentality.  Let's not forget George Corley Wallace, the Alabama governor who was hailed as the "godfather" of a nationwide rebellion against government, godlessness, and gun control. He was their hero, and today's Tea Party adherents are his legacy. They seethe”Xy	  SHOCKING SURGE IN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS!  In a stunning twist, more Americans than expected have filed for unemployment benefits, providing further evidence that layoffs remain alarmingly high despite the supposed growth in the economy. The latest figures from the Labor Department reveal that initial jobless claims skyrocketed by a whopping 37,000 to reach a staggering 464,000 in the week ending July 17. This outrageous number completely exceeded the highest estimate projected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Talk about a bombshell!  To make matters worse, the number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance and extended payments actually dropped. This only highlights the grim reality that the lack of available jobs will severely restrict consumer spending, which happens to be the backbone of our economy. Brace yourselves, folks, because it looks like we're in for a bumpy ride with slower growth in the second half of the year.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke himself warned Congress that it will take an absurdly long time to recover the nearly 8.5 million jobs lost during the 2008 and 2009 economic crisis. It's as if the demand for labor is in a coma, according to economist Omair Sharif. And if that's the case, we can kiss goodbye to decent wages and salaries, not to mention the negative impact it'll have on consumer spending. The future is looking pretty grim, folks.  Now, before you start panicking too much, it's important to note that part of this spike in unemployment claims can be attributed to factories reopening after mid-year retooling, which resulted in fewer job losses than the government initially estimated. So, we can expect these numbers to even out in the next week or two, or so we're told by a Labor Department spokesperson. But let's keep our eyes on the prize, people!  Let's not forget that this forecast was based on the opinions of 42 economists, who didn't see this coming from a mile away. Their estimates ranged from 420,000 to 460,000, but reality decided to slap them in the face with a figure of 464,000. Ouch! And just to add salt to the wounds, the Labor Department revised the previous week's figure to 427,000, up from the initial estimate of 429,000. It's like they can't even get their facts straight!  But wait, there's more! The four-week moving average, which is a more stable measure than the weekly numbers, climbed to 456,000 last week. It”Xß
  SHOCKING SURVEY: Veterans Feel Unsupported and Misunderstood on College Campuses!  Enrollment of brave veterans is skyrocketing on American college campuses, but they're not getting the support they deserve, a shocking national survey reveals.  Researchers from the prestigious National Survey of Student Engagement spoke to nearly 11,000 student veterans who were either first-year students or seniors at four-year schools. The findings were jaw-dropping!  According to the survey, veterans reported having less interaction with their instructors compared to their civilian classmates. They were also less likely to take advantage of educational opportunities like internships or study abroad programs. This is a major concern!  The Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research conducts this eye-opening survey every year to measure the effectiveness of student-faculty interaction and learning. And the latest results, set to be released this week, suggest that colleges must urgently find ways to better engage student veterans and create supportive environments that promote success.  Transitioning from military life to civilian life is already an uphill battle, but fitting in on a college campus is a culture shock that's nearly impossible to navigate, says Michael Dakduk, the deputy executive director of Student Veterans of America. This organization, with chapters in over 300 campuses, understands the struggles veterans face.  But wait, there's more! Veterans often feel disconnected for other reasons too. The survey found that they are more likely to transfer between schools or enroll part-time. Shockingly, one in five combat veterans reported having a disability, compared to just one in ten non-veterans. On top of that, veterans have to juggle more responsibilities, like working or taking care of their families, than traditional college students.  Despite these overwhelming obstacles, the survey revealed that veterans are just as dedicated to their studies as their peers. It's truly amazing to see how many veterans are succeeding against all odds, says Dakduk. But colleges need to wake up and acknowledge that student veterans are different and require more support.  Brian Hawthorne, a graduate student at George Washington University and a former Army soldier who served two tours in Iraq, echoes this sentiment. Veterans need administrators who truly understand the complex GI Bill and can help them graduate in less than four years. The veteran experience is one that most people don't comprehend, Hawthorne states. It's the essential services that keep veterans in school.  It's time for colleges to step up and give these heroes the support they need and deserve. Let's honor their sacrifice and ensure they have every opportunity to succeed!”X	  SHOCKING DESPERATION! Small Town's Cry for Help!  The once-thriving Main Street now lies abandoned and forgotten, but some see opportunity in the darkness. Roger Jones, the determined executive director of the Ottumwa Economic Development Corp., has taken it upon himself to bring life back to this ghost town. Armed with nothing but a phone and a glimmer of hope, he has embarked on a mission to bring businesses to Ottumwa. But it's been a bumpy road, folks!  Jones has been dialing up businesses from coast to coast, pleading with them to consider setting up shop in this forgotten land. And let's just say, he's been met with more laughter than support! Can you believe it? But Jones isn't giving up. He's a fighter, folks, and he's ready to try again and again. That's the spirit!  Ottumwa, once a bustling factory town, is now drowning in despair. Unemployment is at a staggering 9.5 percent, and families are struggling to make ends meet with a median income of a measly $30,000. The situation is so dire that over half of the town's school children rely on free or reduced-cost lunches. It's heart-wrenching, folks.  Attempts to revive this sinking ship have been nothing short of outrageous. The town even managed to raise funds for a Video Game Hall of Fame! Can you imagine? They were hoping this would be their golden ticket, a Midwestern Cooperstown, if you will. But alas, it didn't solve their problems.  Last year, John Deere, one of the town's major employers, made a devastating blow by laying off 500 workers. The community was rocked to its core. They thought they were immune to the hardships faced by cities like Detroit, but they were wrong.  Enter President Barack Obama, swooping in on his three-state, two-day swing through the Midwest. He's here to save the day, folks! Obama has big plans to revitalize the rural business economy, including tax credits for clean energy production and boosting trade opportunities for small businesses. But let's be real, folks, his presence alone won't be enough to restore hope in this desperate town.  The people of Ottumwa are skeptical, and who can blame them? Obama's last visit in 2007 was just before he skyrocketed to presidential fame. Many here see this trip as nothing more than a gesture of gratitude for their support back then. But times have changed, and”Xý  SHOCKING MEETING IN THE OVAL OFFICE: President Obama and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer come face-to-face to discuss the controversial state law that has ignited a firestorm of debate! Despite their differences, Brewer claims the meeting was cordial, but what really went down behind closed doors?  In a surprising turn of events, Obama assures Brewer that White House staff will visit the state to discuss border security with local officials. Is this a strategic move by the president to win over critics of his immigration policies? Only time will tell.  But that's not all - Brewer drops a bombshell about her father's death during the meeting. Reports have surfaced that Brewer embellished the circumstances, falsely claiming her father fought the Nazis. The truth is far from heroic. He actually passed away from illness in California in 1955.  Brewer's response to the allegations reveals a different side to her father's story. She explains that her father, Wilford Drinkwine, worked at the Hawthorne Ammunition Depot in Western Nevada during World War II. Unfortunately, he suffered from lung disease due to exposure to hazardous chemicals and toxic fumes. Brewer paints a picture of a dedicated civil servant who sacrificed his health for the country.  While Brewer declares the meeting a victory, the White House states that Obama reiterated his concerns with the Arizona law. The president believes that a patchwork of different state regulations on immigration will only complicate matters. Instead, he wants Brewer to work with him on comprehensive changes to the immigration system, including a path to citizenship for those already in the country illegally.  Is Obama trying to sweet-talk Brewer into supporting his immigration agenda? Press secretary Robert Gibbs urges Brewer to convince Senator John McCain to back comprehensive immigration legislation. Will McCain be the key to achieving the president's goals?  Brewer, however, remains steadfast in her stance. She insists that the border must be secured before she can join forces with Obama on broader immigration reform. Will the two ever see eye to eye on this contentious issue?  The meeting between Obama and Brewer may have ended, but the battle over immigration is far from over. Stay tuned for more updates on this heated saga!”Xµ	  "Obama Administration in Turmoil Over Airport Security: Naked Scanners or Privacy? Explosive Debate Rages On!  In the wake of the Christmas Day terrorist attack, the Obama administration is in a frenzy to revamp airport security measures. But the question on everyone's mind is, at what cost? The controversial whole-body imaging scanner, which leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination, is under scrutiny and causing quite a stir. Even former homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff is in favor of giving these scanners a shot. And now, the U.S. Travel Association, representing the industry, is joining the chorus, demanding a thorough analysis of this technology.  Roger Dow, president and chief executive of the U.S. Travel Association, has spoken out, calling for a closer look at whole-body imaging. He stated, 'We need to determine if this technology can truly beef up security and make travel easier for everyone. It's time to shift the focus from privacy to a more detailed analysis.' The association is pushing for a balanced approach that prioritizes both safety and privacy, while ensuring a hassle-free travel experience.  The U.S. Travel Association is also advocating for increased use of canine security, but not everyone is convinced. Douglas Laird, a former security director and president of a security consulting firm, supports the idea of scrutinizing the scanners more closely. 'It's the only way we can find what we're looking for,' he passionately stated. However, he is less enthusiastic about using dogs for airport security. Laird believes that dogs have limitations, as they can only work for a certain number of hours a day. Moreover, crafty terrorists can easily outsmart dogs by manipulating explosive devices to avoid detection. 'These guys are engineers; they know how to do it,' Laird warned.  While the security debate rages on, let's take a break and talk about something different - the upcoming 2010 Vancouver Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games! If you're planning to attend, don't miss out on the opportunity to visit the Vancouver Art Gallery. From February 6 to May 2, the gallery will showcase Leonardo da Vinci's 'Anatomical Manuscript A' - a fascinating exhibition called 'Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man.' And here's the best part - it's free for the public during the Winter Games! For the rest of the year, admission is $21 for adults, $15 for seniors, $14 for students, $7 for kids aged 5-12, and free for children under”XÜ	  SHOCKING PLAN TO DEMOLISH HOMES PUT ON HOLD! Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat has just made an announcement that has sent shockwaves through the city. The municipality has decided to delay their ruthless plan to demolish homes in an Arab neighborhood. And you won't believe who's behind this sudden change of heart - none other than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself!  In a desperate plea to Barkat, Netanyahu asked for more time to negotiate with the residents before tearing down their houses. He warned of troublemakers who want to stir up trouble and create chaos over the city's plan. Could it be that there are hidden forces at play here?  But Barkat, speaking at a press conference in Jerusalem's city hall, defended the plan, claiming it was designed to cater to the needs of the residents. He also accused extremists of twisting the plan and making false accusations against him and his team. It seems like no matter what they do, there will always be people trying to undermine their efforts.  The demolition of unauthorized Arab construction in Jerusalem has long been a bone of contention between Israel and the international community. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even weighed in on the matter, criticizing the eviction of families and demolition of homes in East Jerusalem. It's clear that this issue is causing tension on a global scale.  Advocacy group Ir Amim is also speaking out against the plan, warning that demolishing homes in the Silwan neighborhood could lead to disastrous consequences. They argue that it has the potential to ignite violence in one of the most volatile areas and threaten the stability and political future of Jerusalem. Could this decision have far-reaching consequences?  Barkat, however, has assured Arab residents that they will be provided with alternative housing in the area. But is this enough to calm their fears and ease tensions? Only time will tell.  It's no secret that Jerusalem is a city riddled with controversy and conflict. The international community has not recognized Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem, and Palestinians view it as their future capital. With all these opposing forces at play, it's no wonder that decisions like this are met with such fierce opposition.  Will Barkat and Netanyahu be able to find a solution that satisfies everyone? Or are they just delaying the inevitable? One thing's for sure - the eyes of the world are on Jerusalem, waiting to see what happens next. Stay tuned for more updates on this gripping saga.”X”	  SARAH PALIN: POLITICAL POWERHOUSE OR JUST A CELEBRITY?  Sarah Palin, the Republican Party's biggest celebrity, has been captivating crowds with her fiery speeches and grassroots movement. But can she actually make a dent in the political world and mobilize a significant number of voters? The jury is still out on that one.  Some experts believe that Palin is destined to be a leader of a movement rather than a leader of a nation. They compare her to the likes of George Wallace and Ross Perot, who were protest candidates that couldn't win over the masses. Republican strategist Alex Castellanos argues, "Sarah Palin will have to choose to be either the leader of a movement or the leader of a nation. She can't be both." Harsh words, but is there any truth to them?  If Palin does have her sights set on the presidency, she has a massive mountain to climb. A recent poll found that a whopping 71 percent of Americans don't think she's qualified to be president. These numbers are so discouraging that even some Republicans who admire her doubt she'll run in 2012. And unless she can change people's minds dramatically, winning a general election seems like a distant dream.  However, GOP strategist Phil Musser believes that if Palin were to run for president today, she would easily secure the Republican nomination. This is a significant endorsement, considering Musser is an advisor to Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who is also eyeing a 2012 candidacy. Musser claims that Palin's intensity, which she brought to the ticket in 2008, hasn't faded but has only grown stronger.  The media frenzy surrounding Palin is undeniable. Her recent speech at the National Tea Party Convention was broadcast live by all major cable news channels. Even her casual comment on "Fox News Sunday" about leaving the door open for a 2012 campaign made headlines everywhere. It's clear that she's a magnet for attention.  Palin's popularity extends beyond the media. At a recent campaign event for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, she drew an astonishing crowd of around 8,000 people. According to Perry advisor David Carney, it was the largest Republican primary event in the history of the state. The audience was built solely through social media and word-of-mouth, without spending a dime on ads or phone calls. The coverage was "wall to wall" across the state.  There's no denying that Palin is a force to be reckoned with within the Republican Party. However, just how much”XÉ	  Pakistan's DEADLIEST FLOODS in decades have taken the lives of over 1,500 people, leaving the government scrambling to provide aid. While President Asif Ali Zardari gallivants around Europe, the devastated northwestern province is left to fend for itself. Talk about a disappearing act! And let's not forget about the army's battle against Taliban guerrillas in the same region. This is a disaster on top of a disaster!  To make matters worse, the monsoon rains are showing no mercy and are expected to continue for the next few days. These relentless rains have already destroyed bridges, roads, and entire villages. The Indus River valley, home to the majority of Pakistan's population, is on high alert as floods threaten to ruin crops. Mother Nature is definitely showing her dark side.  But here's the real kicker: the government and private relief agencies are only managing to provide a measly 5 percent of what's actually needed. Five percent?! That's like putting a tiny band-aid on a gaping wound. The Edhi Foundation, known for running Pakistan's largest ambulance and rescue services, is practically pulling their hair out trying to help. It's a desperate situation, folks.  Meanwhile, flood survivors are left stranded, desperately seeking transport to safer areas. The government has sent soldiers to the Swat Valley to rescue people by helicopter, but what about those who lost their homes? They're left to fend for themselves, camping wherever they can with no access to drinking water. Talk about a government failure!  But wait, here's where it gets even more shocking: Islamic militant activists have taken it upon themselves to distribute aid packages in the affected areas. Yes, you read that right. These militants are stealing the government's thunder and actually helping those in need. Looks like they're trying to win some brownie points with the locals. Sneaky, sneaky.  This is not the first time the government has shown its incompetence in providing relief. Remember the 2005 earthquake that killed 86,000 people? The U.S. and Islamic militants swooped in to save the day while the government was left floundering. And guess what? History is repeating itself. U.S. Air Force cargo planes have arrived with food packages as part of a $10 million emergency aid package. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is trying to improve America's image among Pakistanis, but with only a measly 17 percent viewing the U.S. positively, it's going to take a lot more than food packages.  The”X×	  SHOCKING: Obama Considers Releasing Guantanamo Detainees!  In a shocking turn of events, the Obama administration is reportedly considering lifting its suspension on transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees to Yemen. This comes after a federal court ruling that found overwhelming evidence to support a Yemeni detainee's claim of unlawful detention for over eight years.  The case of Mohammed Odaini has become so urgent that top administration officials, including the secretaries of defense and state, are set to discuss it next week. However, the White House wants to make it clear that this decision should not be seen as a reflection of a broader policy for other Yemeni detainees.  A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed that they are not considering a blanket lifting of the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen. So, don't worry folks, this is supposedly just a one-time exception.  But wait, there's more! The administration may face even more pressure to release additional Yemenis. It is estimated that as many as 20 more Yemeni detainees could be set free due to a lack of evidence against them. The government may have to keep carving out exceptions to its ban. Oh, the dilemma!  Let's not forget the star of this saga, Mohammed Odaini. He was just a 17-year-old student when he found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. After accepting an invitation to a guesthouse in Pakistan, Odaini and several others were turned over to the United States by Pakistani authorities. The government argued that his presence in the guesthouse linked him to an al-Qaeda affiliated network, but a federal judge disagreed.  In a scathing opinion, U.S. District Court Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., ordered Odaini's release, stating that his detention has done nothing to make the United States more secure. Judge Kennedy was emphatic that there is no evidence linking Odaini to al-Qaeda. The court has spoken!  This latest development comes after President Obama halted all transfers to Yemen following the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound plane by a Nigerian suspect with ties to Yemen. Republicans had previously voiced their concerns about repatriating Yemeni detainees, and now this case has them even more worried.  "This is a bad case to argue. There is nothing there," said one Capitol Hill insider who opposes transfers to Yemen. The plot thickens, and the Obama administration finds itself caught in a political web.

Hold onto your taste buds, folks, because Kraft Foods Inc. is making a jaw-dropping move that will have you questioning everything you thought you knew about their delicious products. Brace yourselves, because over the next two years, Kraft plans to reduce sodium levels in their North American brands by a whopping 10 percent! That's right, they're taking the salt out of your favorite snacks!  But wait, Kraft isn't the only one jumping on the low-sodium bandwagon. Campbell Soup Co. and ConAgra Foods Inc. have already made similar efforts to reduce sodium levels in their products. It's like a healthy eating revolution, and these food giants are leading the charge!  Susan Davison, a spokeswoman for Kraft, spilled the beans on this shocking development. She revealed that Kraft will be cutting salt levels in over 1,000 products. Can you believe it? Even the iconic Oscar Mayer bologna will see a reduction in sodium levels by a staggering 17 percent! And if you're a fan of Easy Mac Cups, get ready to have your mind blown because some flavors will see a drop of 20 percent in sodium content. That's a major win for your health!  Rhonda Jordan, Kraft's president of health and wellness, says this move is a win-win situation. "It's good for consumers, and, if done properly, it's good for business," she shared in a statement. More and more people are concerned about their sodium intake, and Kraft wants to help them turn their intentions into actions. Talk about a company that cares!  But don't worry, not all your favorite Kraft products will be affected. Grey Poupon mustard and Crystal Light beverages, for example, are already low in sodium, so they won't be changed. A serving of Grey Poupon Dijon mustard only has 5 percent of the FDA's recommended daily intake of sodium. So go ahead and slather that mustard on guilt-free!  The food industry better take note because if they don't voluntarily reduce salt content in their processed foods, they might face sodium limits from the federal government. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned about this in an editorial published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. It's time for the industry to step up and make healthier choices for the sake of our health!  According to a Stanford University study, American adults consume a shocking 3,900 milligrams”XN  SHOCKING SENTENCE FOR GAY COUPLE!  In a shocking turn of events, a judge in Malawi has sentenced Tiwonge Chimbalanga and Steven Monjeza to a whopping 14 years in prison for engaging in unnatural acts and gross indecency. This comes as no surprise, as the same judge had already found them guilty earlier this week under outdated colonial-era laws.  It all started when 20-year-old hotel janitor, Chimbalanga, and his partner Monjeza, who was unemployed, celebrated their engagement with a party at the hotel where Chimbalanga worked. This event, which was a first in Malawi, caught the attention of law enforcement, leading to their arrest the very next day.  The sentence has sparked outrage, with Michelle Kagari, deputy Africa director of Amnesty International, calling it an absolute disgrace. Amnesty International has even adopted Chimbalanga and Monjeza as prisoners of conscience, vowing to campaign for their unconditional release.  Despite international criticism, the government of Malawi remains defiant in their prosecution of the couple. Unfortunately, Malawi is not alone in its stance on homosexuality, as at least 37 other countries in Africa also criminalize same-sex relationships. In fact, Uganda is even contemplating a bill that could result in life imprisonment or execution for homosexuals.  Even in South Africa, the only African country that recognizes gay rights, the situation is not much better. Shockingly, gangs have resorted to raping lesbians, further exacerbating the already dire situation for the LGBTQ+ community in Africa.  As a result of the discrimination and persecution they face, gay individuals are often forced underground, making it difficult for them to seek counseling and treatment for AIDS. Activists fear that this will only contribute to the already high HIV rates in Malawi, where an estimated 1 million people, around 12 percent of the population, are living with the virus.  The world watches in horror as this unjust sentence is handed down to Chimbalanga and Monjeza. Let us hope that justice will prevail, and they will be released unconditionally as soon as possible.”Xý	  "Obama's Broken Promises: Gay Community Demands Action Now!  President Barack Obama is all talk and no action when it comes to delivering on his major campaign promises to the gay community. Despite his soaring speeches and sweet promises, Obama has failed to champion their causes from the White House.  But now, on the eve of a major gay-rights rally, Obama is scrambling to save face. He plans to address thousands of gays and lesbians at a fundraising dinner for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay-rights group in the U.S. It's a desperate attempt to reaffirm his commitment to their priorities.  A White House spokesman claims that Obama will outline the progress he hopes to achieve for the gay community in the coming weeks and months. But can he be trusted? Advocates are skeptical, and for good reason.  Since taking office, Obama has let down the gay community time and time again. He has not followed through on promises to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military or push for tough nondiscrimination policies. It's a slap in the face to those who believed in his message of hope and change.  "I'm disappointed because a lot of us young people trusted Obama to bring about quick and decisive change," said Kip Williams, co-director of the National Equality March. "Now we're facing the reality that it's just empty words."  Williams is not alone in his frustration. Many in the gay community are demanding real commitments with clear timelines. They want action, not just dreams and visions.  Obama has made feeble attempts to pacify the gay community in the past. He highlighted some initial efforts, such as expanding federal benefits to same-sex partners. But let's be honest, those are just crumbs compared to his biggest promises.  The president has publicly pledged to repeal the discriminatory 'don't ask, don't tell' policy, but he hasn't taken any concrete steps to make it happen. His national security adviser even hinted that Obama would only focus on overturning it 'at the right time.' What a cop-out!  And let's not forget Obama's promise to work for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act. Yet his own administration's lawyers defended the law in a court brief. It's a betrayal of the highest order.  The gay community is divided on whether they should continue to trust Obama. The Human Rights Campaign, which invited him to speak at its dinner, remains hopeful, clinging to the belief that Obama is the most supportive president they've ever had.  But actions speak louder than words. Obama needs to step up”X=
  Headline: "Stocks Surge to New Highs Despite Market Uncertainty!"  In a wild rollercoaster ride, stocks ended the day on a mixed note, leaving investors scratching their heads. The New York Stock Exchange witnessed more falls than rises, but that didn't stop stocks from reaching new 13-month highs. How did this happen? Well, it seems that higher commodity prices, especially in the energy and materials sectors, gave stocks a much-needed boost.  This erratic session had investors on edge, with news from retailers and industrial production causing the market to zigzag. Thankfully, a rebound in the dollar provided some stability, preventing stocks from spiraling out of control. However, experts warn that the long-term weakening trend of the dollar has been driving up commodities prices and benefiting U.S. exporters. This is great news for these companies, as a weaker dollar means stronger foreign demand for their goods.  The cherry on top of this stock market frenzy is the record-low U.S. interest rates, which have sent investors flocking to stocks and commodities in search of higher returns. It's like a gold rush, but with stocks and commodities instead.  Energy stocks got a boost from higher oil prices, and trading volume remained light. Traders were particularly interested in retailers' earnings reports, as they provided insight into consumer spending. Home Depot, Saks, and Target all reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, but they also expressed caution about the upcoming holiday shopping season. It seems that despite the stock market rallying, consumers are still operating at recessionary levels.  On a more positive note, a government report showed a rebound in overall sales in October, which lifted stocks on Monday. Investors are eagerly awaiting signs of a consumer spending recovery during the holiday season, as it plays a significant role in driving the U.S. economy.  However, not all news was rosy. The market was weighed down by a report on industrial production that fell short of economists' predictions. The Federal Reserve reported a mere 0.1 percent rise in output at factories, mines, and utilities in October, compared to the anticipated 0.4 percent. On the bright side, signs of inflation remained muted, which is considered a positive signal for the economy. The Producer Price Index, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, rose less than expected in October.  Despite all the uncertainties, the Dow Jones industrial average managed to rise by 30.46 points, reaching its highest close since October 2008. The broader S&P 500 index also inched up by ”XC	  SHOCKING FALL FROM GRACE: Former Priest Accused of Sexual Misconduct Finds New Job Helping Others!  In a scandal that rocked the nation, Russell Dillard, a once-respected faith adviser and pastor, was accused of unthinkable acts by two brave sisters. The shocking allegations claimed that Dillard had kissed and fondled them when they were just innocent teens. And now, the National Enquirer can reveal the jaw-dropping truth about what happened to this fallen priest!  Dillard, now 62, was immediately removed from his position after the accusations came to light. But that's not all - he was swiftly stripped of his ministerial duties and eventually defrocked. It's important to note that no criminal or civil charges were ever filed against him.  But what has Dillard been up to since his disgrace? Well, it seems he hasn't let his past hold him back! After being defrocked, he decided to pursue a master's degree in social work from Catholic University. And guess what? He actually managed to land a job advising people on how to get health care!  Wait, it gets even crazier! Rumor has it that Dillard was engaged at one point, but shockingly, he never made it down the aisle. Could it be that his reputation preceded him? Who knows!  One of the brave sisters who accused Dillard, Kathryn Barrett-Gaines, was absolutely floored when she heard about his new position serving others. "This is not some hotshot job, and he loves to be the hotshot," she exclaimed. Barrett-Gaines, who is a respected history professor and a member of her parish council, believes that Dillard lacks empathy, which is why he should have never been a priest in the first place. "I'm just glad he's not a teacher or a doctor," she added.  Despite the scandal, Dillard remains a practicing Catholic. According to witnesses, he still attends post-worship coffee hour at St. Martin of Tours in Washington a few Sundays a month. Some loyal parishioners even claim that he is still well-loved within the community. "Those who come around him, talk with him, don't have ill feelings or will about the allegations. Those who did believe [the accusations] just don't say anything," revealed Octavia Jackson, who was married by Dillard in 1990.  It's a shocking tale of redemption and resilience. Can someone who has fallen so far ever truly find redemption? Only time will tell. But for now, Russell”XÀ	  Elena Kagan's Childhood: A True Battle Zone!  Step into the gritty streets of 1960s and 1970s Manhattan, where drug addicts and prostitutes roamed just steps away from young Elena Kagan's childhood home. This future Supreme Court nominee's parents, a schoolteacher and attorney, were just like any other residents of the Upper West Side's glamorous boulevards. But lurking just three blocks away in Sherman Square, a haven for heroin dealers, the scene was far from glamorous. This notorious spot was even featured in the 1971 film "The Panic in Needle Park," starring none other than Al Pacino.  Growing up in New York during those days was a wild ride, and Kagan was right in the middle of it all. Margaret Raymond, a high school friend of Kagan's and a former law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall, revealed that Kagan's worldview was shaped by the wide range of experiences she witnessed in her own neighborhood. Walking down the street, Kagan would encounter a melting pot of characters that most people only see in movies.  Now a seasoned solicitor general under President Barack Obama, Kagan has remained tight-lipped about her childhood and isn't granting any interviews until her Senate confirmation hearings. But according to Raymond, Kagan and her peers at Hunter College High School had big dreams and ambitions. They were a group of smart, driven young women who were destined for greatness.  In a bold statement made in a 1980 article for Princeton University's school newspaper, Kagan revealed that her liberal principles were ingrained in her from a young age. She mourned the Democratic losses at the polls and proudly declared that nobody in her Upper West Side neighborhood would ever admit to voting Republican. The area, known for its liberal political views, was even dubbed the "Upper Left Side" by The Village Voice.  But life in this part of Manhattan wasn't always so politically charged. Lawrence Block, a novelist, recalls that the Upper West Side was far from the expensive haven it is today. In fact, as hard drugs infiltrated the neighborhood, the area around Kagan's home turned into a real-life nightmare. Block even used the drug addicts who congregated near Kagan's house as extras in one of his novels. These junkies showed him the buildings where they bought drugs and even where they would shoot up, just a stone's throw away from Kagan's front door.  Architectural historian Christopher Gray, who also lived on the Upper West Side, describes the area as "”Xe	  SHUTTERED HOTEL SYMBOLIZES IRELAND'S ECONOMIC NIGHTMARE  Dublin's Glashaus hotel, once a beacon of hope in a tough neighborhood, now stands as a chilling reminder of Ireland's economic woes. Developer Liam Carroll's empire has crumbled, leaving the Glashaus and the nearby Tallaght Cross Hotel closed and abandoned. It's a tragic game of survival, as the recession has hit Ireland's hotel industry hard.  During Ireland's real estate boom, Carroll's boutique hotel opened its doors with great fanfare. But now, creditors have taken control, and the dream has turned into a nightmare. The Glashaus is just one of many casualties in a country overwhelmed by a flood of hotel rooms and a mountain of debt. The once-thriving industry has been brought to its knees as visitors dwindle.  Desperate to stay afloat and avoid repaying tax breaks, some hotels are slashing prices to lure in guests. It's a cutthroat game of survival, pitting newer establishments against long-established venues. The Irish Hotels Federation reports that hotel occupancy plummeted to a shocking 54 percent in 2009, the lowest in decades. In the midst of the boom in 2007, that number was a much healthier 64 percent.  The Central Statistics Office reveals that the number of trips to Ireland has fallen a devastating 20 percent over the past two years. With nearly $9 billion in bank borrowings, hotels are drowning in debt. Allied Irish Banks, one of the country's largest lenders, has classified 60 percent of its hotel loans as "criticized," indicating that they are either in trouble or closely monitored. Even British banking giant Lloyds is pulling out of Ireland, leaving hoteliers in a precarious situation.  While the economy is expected to grow slightly this year, after suffering an 11 percent contraction over the past two years, unemployment is still on the rise. Experts predict that unemployment will reach 13.3 percent in 2010, up from 11.8 percent the previous year. The situation is dire, and the hotel industry is feeling the brunt of it.  Many hotels were given tax breaks during Ireland's economic boom, but that comes with a catch. In order to maintain the tax benefits, hotels must remain open for at least seven years. As a result, these struggling establishments are slashing prices in a desperate attempt to stay in business. Joe O'Flynn, owner of Rathsallagh Country House Hotel, expresses his frustration,”X×  SHOCKING VICTORY FOR GERMANY AS THEY CRUSH BELGIUM 1-0!  In a thrilling start to Euro 2012, Germany secured a jaw-dropping 1-0 win against Belgium. Led by the legendary forward Miroslav Klose, the Germans proved their dominance on the field.  Klose, with his lightning-fast reflexes, scored his 53rd goal for Germany in a spectacular fashion. Bastian Schweinsteiger brilliantly snatched the ball away from Belgian defender Daniel Van Buyten and passed it to Thomas Mueller. Mueller then served up a perfect assist to Klose, who made an easy putaway. Talk about teamwork!  The whole world watched in awe as the German players effortlessly found each other, seemingly blindfolded. It was a goal that showcased the incredible talent of Bayern Munich players, from Van Buyten's mistake to Klose's masterful finish. This early lead in Group A has set Germany on a path to glory.  The World Cup semifinalists, known for their breathtaking style of play in South Africa, exhibited some of that same magic on the field. Their next match is against Azerbaijan on Tuesday in Cologne, and fans can't wait to see what they have in store.  Meanwhile, Belgium will be facing Turkey next after suffering a crushing defeat. Turkey, who beat Kazakhstan 3-0, now shares the lead with Germany. Belgian captain Thomas Vermaelen admitted defeat, saying, "They were too dominant a team. We were powerless to get a draw." The Belgians started strong, but the Germans quickly took control and never let go.  Despite their victory, Germany fell short of their World Cup form, where they dazzled the world with their extraordinary football skills. Spectacular wins over England and Argentina left fans speechless, but this time, they didn't quite reach those heights.  Let's take a look at the lineups for both teams. Belgium had Logan Bailly in goal, with Toby Alderweireld, Daniel Van Buyten, Vincent Kompany, and Thomas Vermaelen forming their defense. Their midfield consisted of Marouane Fellaini, Timmy Simons, and Jan Vertonghen, while Moussa Dembele, Romelu Lukaku, and Eden Hazard led their attack.  On the other hand, Germany had Manuel Neuer guarding the net, with Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker, Holger Badstuber, and Marcell Jansen forming their solid defense.

In a shocking decision, the United Nations Security Council has unanimously voted to extend the peacekeeping mission in East Timor for another year. But hold on to your hats, folks, because there's more to this story than meets the eye!  According to our sources, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is actually endorsing plans to reduce the number of international police in East Timor. That's right, they want to withdraw some of the security forces! Can you believe it?  The resolution, adopted on Friday, is all about Ban's intention to gradually reduce the number of international police from 1,608 to 1,280 by mid-2011. They want to hand over the responsibility to East Timor's own police force. But wait a minute, isn't that a risky move? Will the local police be able to handle the job?  We've got some inside information that the council has asked Ban to submit a report on the plans for this police drawdown. They want to know all the details by October 15th. And if that's not enough, they want another report by January 26th, 2011, with possible adjustments to the mission's mandate and strength. It seems like they're really unsure about this whole situation!  But here's the real kicker, folks. East Timor's Deputy Prime Minister, Jose Luis Guterres, told the council that the government agrees with Ban's plan to keep the mission in the country until 2012. However, he also expressed hope that they could wrap it all up by then. So, what's the deal? Are they staying or going? It's a real cliffhanger!  Stay tuned to the National Enquirer for all the latest updates on this thrilling peacekeeping mission in East Timor. Will they withdraw the international police? Will the local police be able to handle the responsibility? Only time will tell!”X	  "India's Industrial Production Skyrockets!! Inflation Soars as Europe's Debt Crisis Looms. The Indian economy is on fire, with industrial production surging more than 10 percent for the sixth straight month in March. And guess what? It's adding to inflation pressures! Can you believe it? As if Europe's debt crisis wasn't enough to worry about, now India is throwing its weight around in the global economic recovery. Output at factories, utilities, and mines shot up a whopping 13.5 percent in March from the previous year, following a 15.1 percent increase in February. Whoa! Looks like the experts were off the mark, with their measly 15.1 percent estimate. Talk about underestimating India's power! But don't fret, folks, because Reserve Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has a plan. He's gonna raise interest rates in a 'calibrated' manner to rein in inflation. And believe it or not, this approach is finally getting some support from economists like Kotak Securities's Mridul Saggar. He used to complain that the central bank wasn't doing enough to slow inflation, but now he's singing a different tune. "The developments in Europe have vindicated the RBI's approach of gradualism in monetary tightening," Saggar said. "We still expect a further rate hike of 25 basis points or more in July." Looks like someone finally sees the light! Meanwhile, Europe is in deep trouble with its debt crisis, but India is keeping a close eye on the situation. Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma said they're monitoring it carefully. Smart move, India! And let's not forget about the surge in factory output. With rising wages, people in India are demanding more houses and cars. Salaries are expected to grow at the fastest pace in the Asia Pacific this year. Way to go, India! And the cherry on top? The country's economy may have grown a whopping 8.6 percent last quarter, the fastest pace in over two years. It's no wonder the stock market is booming, with the benchmark Sensitive Index gaining over 40 percent in the past year. And let's not forget about the rupee, which has advanced a solid 8.5 percent during the same period. But all this growth comes with a price - inflation is heating up, folks. The yield on the 10-year government bond has shot up, stoking inflation fears. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's”X³  "Auxerre Stuns Le Mans with Last-Minute Goal, Takes Lead in French League!"  In a jaw-dropping match that had fans on the edge of their seats, Auxerre snatched victory from the jaws of defeat with a thrilling 2-1 win over Le Mans. The hero of the hour was none other than Benoit Pedretti, who scored a sensational stoppage-time goal to send the crowd into a frenzy.  The drama began in the 25th minute when Poland forward Ireneusz Jelen tapped in a cross from Dennis Oliech to give Auxerre the lead. It was Jelen's 10th goal of the season, and it set the stage for what would be a nail-biting clash.  Just when it seemed like Auxerre would sail to victory, Le Mans struck back in the 89th minute. Thorstein Helstad rose above the defense and unleashed a powerful header to equalize. The Auxerre coach, Jean Fernandez, admitted that his team made a crucial mistake in marking, but they were determined not to let it ruin their night.  With time running out, Auxerre rallied and seized the momentum. In a stunning turn of events, Pedretti received a pass from Oliech and calmly slotted the ball into the back of the net in the first minute of injury time. The roar of the crowd was deafening as Auxerre celebrated their hard-earned victory.  Coach Fernandez couldn't hide his excitement, declaring to Europe 1 radio, "We didn't give up! We took advantage of the momentum that has been carrying us in our last few matches. If we continue this incredible run, who's to say we won't secure a European spot at the end of the season?"  This victory catapulted Auxerre to the top of the French league, with 55 points from 29 matches. They now have Bordeaux in their sights, who sit two points behind but have played two fewer games. Montpellier and Lille are also nipping at their heels, tied on points with Bordeaux. Lyon is not far behind, making the race for the top spot fiercer than ever.  Unfortunately for Le Mans, the defeat dropped them to 19th place with a mere 21 points. It was a devastating blow for the team, but they still have time to turn their fortunes around.

Will 'One Nation' Be the Answer to Progressive Woes?"  In a shocking bid to replicate the success of the tea party movement, 170 liberal and civil rights groups are joining forces to create a coalition that will match the movement's political energy and influence. They're determined to counter the tea party narrative and help the progressive movement regain its voice after a staggering 18 months of floundering. Dubbed 'One Nation', this grand attempt at liberal unity aims to resurrect the themes that once energized the progressive grassroots.  But let's not forget, these liberal groups have always had a bit of sibling rivalry, constantly jostling over competing agendas and trying to influence the same lawmakers. It's no surprise that they struggled to settle on a name for their coalition. And to add fuel to the fire, two major players can't even agree on who came up with the idea of holding a march this fall. It's like a liberal soap opera!  But hey, the tea party movement has had its fair share of drama too. Some groups boycotted a planned gathering in Nashville, accusing the organizers of profiteering. They've also argued over which candidates truly represent the movement. So, in a way, the liberal effort is already mimicking the fractious nature of the tea party.  Regardless of the infighting, the 'One Nation' effort was born out of necessity. At one of the first meetings, Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, asked, "Raise your hand if you can push your part of the agenda all by yourself." Not a single hand shot up! They realized they needed to band together if they wanted to achieve their goals.  And boy, do they have some goals! An immigration law overhaul seems dead in the water this year, legislation to help labor unions grow their membership is stuck in Congress, and the jobless rate for blacks and Hispanics is alarmingly high. It's no wonder Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP, said, "Having been confronted with the specter of the tea party... we felt it urgent to organize the majority of this country, which voted in 2008 and has gone back to the couch."

The stunning actress, known for her roles on hit TV shows like "Ally McBeal" and "Arrested Development," dropped this bombshell during a secret hearing at a Los Angeles court. The couple, who tied the knot in August 2008, is now legally known as Portia Lee James DeGeneres.  The 37-year-old Australian-born beauty requested the name change just last month, and it seems she got what she wanted without any fuss. But what led to this drastic decision? Is there trouble brewing in paradise? Or is this just a bold statement of love and commitment?  Neither Portia nor Ellen made an appearance at the closed hearing, leaving us all curious about their reasoning behind this name change. Could they be keeping secrets from their adoring fans? We can only speculate!  One thing's for sure, this power couple has always been known for pushing boundaries and breaking barriers. They fearlessly tied the knot during the brief period when gay marriage was legal in California, showing the world that love knows no bounds.  Now, with this name change, Portia DeGeneres is set to make an even bigger splash in Hollywood. Will the actress take on more daring roles? Will she become an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights? Only time will tell!  Stay tuned for more shocking updates on this headline-making couple!”•'     X‘	  Defense Secretary Robert Gates has dealt a major blow to the Lockheed Martin F-35 program, causing shockwaves throughout the military world. In a surprising move, Gates has decided to delay the program, resulting in a decrease of planned purchases by a whopping 10 aircraft in fiscal 2011 and a staggering total of 122 through 2015. This unexpected turn of events has left both Gates and Lockheed reeling.  The defense secretary, who previously expressed a desire to speed up jet purchases and potentially save money, has now had to eat his words. It seems his ambitious plans have been thwarted, much to his disappointment. On the other hand, Lockheed, the largest defense contractor in the world, is also feeling the sting of this setback. Accelerated purchases would have been a goldmine for the company, as the production phase of a program brings in far more revenue than the costly research and development stage. Additionally, Lockheed now faces the daunting prospect of grappling with negotiations that may force them to absorb a share of the program's cost overruns. This was previously not a concern for the company, as they were exempt from covering any overrun costs.  In addition to the delay in Lockheed's program, Gates has directed a hefty sum of $2.4 billion to be spent on purchasing 26 F/A-18E/F planes from Boeing, the second-largest defense contractor. These planes have the unique capability of jamming enemy radar, making them a valuable asset for the military. This move was prompted by Navy officials who expressed concerns about a potential "fighter gap" due to the aging carrier-based jets. Gates' decision, outlined in a top-secret document signed on December 23, is set to be unveiled in the upcoming defense budget release on February 1. The document has been widely circulated within the Pentagon, reaching key figures such as the military chiefs, inspector general, intelligence agencies, and regional combat commanders.  According to the document obtained by Bloomberg News, Gates has slashed the planned purchase of F-35s by significant numbers across the years. In 2011, the purchase has been cut by 10 planes to 42, followed by a reduction of 17 in 2012 to 45, a decrease of 52 in 2013 to 77, a drop of 20 in 2014 to 90, and finally, a decrease of 23 in 2015 to 107. These changes have allowed Gates to redirect a substantial amount of funds from the procurement budget to the ongoing development of the F-35. The”X±	  SHOCKING DISCOVERY IN GERMAN FOREST! Mysterious Body Found Near Kidnapped Banker's Wife's Last Known Location!  In a chilling twist to a shocking crime, authorities have uncovered a woman's lifeless body in a dense forest in southwestern Germany, just a stone's throw away from where a banker's wife was abducted last month. The body, shrouded in secrecy, is yet to be identified, leaving the community on edge and desperate for answers!  According to chilling reports, a brave citizen who was out for an evening stroll with his loyal pooch stumbled upon the gruesome sight on Thursday night. The body was eerily concealed under a pile of branches, as if the perpetrator had gone to great lengths to hide their sinister deed!  This haunting discovery has sent shockwaves through the nation, reigniting the terrifying memory of Maria Boegerl's abduction from her own home in Heidenheim just weeks ago. The 54-year-old victim was snatched right from under her unsuspecting husband's nose, Thomas Boegerl, a high-ranking executive at a local bank. The kidnapper, seemingly hell-bent on causing mayhem, then brazenly reached out to Thomas, demanding a jaw-dropping ransom of â‚¬300,000 (approximately $368,000) in exchange for his beloved wife's safe return!  It is a twisted tale of greed and desperation that took yet another bizarre turn when Thomas dutifully complied with the kidnapper's demands, placing the hefty sum by the side of a bustling highway. But unbelievably, the money was never collected, leaving everyone bewildered and questioning the motives of this cruel and calculating criminal!  In a race against time, more than 100 brave officers, aided by helicopters, tirelessly scoured the area for any sign of Maria. Their valiant efforts, fueled by the determination to reunite her with her anguished family, continued for days on end. Yet, despite their tireless endeavors, the truth remained elusive, and Maria's whereabouts remained a haunting mystery!  As the investigation continues to unravel this twisted web of despair, the community remains on edge, anxiously awaiting any breakthrough that may shed light on this heart-wrenching case. The questions that linger in the air are deafening: Who was this unfortunate victim found in the forest? Could it possibly be Maria Boegerl, the kidnapped wife of the prominent banker? And most importantly, who is responsible for these unspeakable acts of terror?  Stay tuned as the National Enquirer delves deeper into this”XÑ
  Supreme Court Justices Give Green Light to Lock Up "Sexually Dangerous" Criminals After Prison Release  In a shocking turn of events, Supreme Court justices hinted on Tuesday that they are leaning towards upholding a national law that allows for the civil commitment of "sexually dangerous" individuals after they have served their federal prison terms. The arguments heard in Washington left little doubt that the majority of the nine justices believed that Congress had the constitutional power to enact such a law.   This case puts the power of the federal government to prevent sex crimes, which has traditionally been a state function, to the test. While the high court has previously reined in the federal government in other areas over the past decade and a half, Tuesday's hearing revealed a greater concern for public safety than for protecting states' rights.   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, known for her fierce determination, expressed her belief that the government had a responsibility to protect its citizens. "You are talking about endangering the health and safety of people," she argued. "The government has some responsibility, doesn't it?"   However, Justice Antonin Scalia stood alone in his criticism of the statute. He repeatedly voiced his concerns that the federal government was encroaching on state powers. Scalia argued that federal prison officials could achieve the same goal by simply notifying state authorities when a dangerous individual was about to be released and asking them to initiate commitment proceedings. "I find it difficult to believe that an elected governor or an elected attorney general would ignore that letter," Scalia stated. He went on to characterize the Obama administration's arguments in favor of the law as "a recipe for the federal government taking over everything."   The law in question, which is part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, directs the attorney general to "make all reasonable efforts" to persuade states to take responsibility for the custody and treatment of committed individuals. Currently, five men are challenging the civil commitment law, as they are being held under its provisions. Four of them have completed their prison sentences for sex crimes, while the fifth was deemed incompetent to stand trial for sexually abusing a child. These men are currently being held in a treatment facility in Butner, North Carolina.   Prior to the enactment of this law, the federal government's civil commitment power only extended to individuals in U.S. custody who were found incompetent to stand trial, found not guilty by reason of insanity, or determined to be mentally ill after conviction.

In a jaw-dropping revelation, Toronto FC has appointed Predrag Radosavlijevic as their savior to lead them out of their playoff-less misery. The MLS team dropped this bombshell at a press conference on a thrilling Thursday.  Let's rewind a bit, my dear readers. The charismatic Radosavlijevic, also known as the "Miracle Man," is stepping into the shoes of Chris Cummins, who hastily departed the team just last month. And if that wasn't enough drama for you, Cummins had taken over from the angst-ridden John Carver, who dramatically left the club midseason out of pure frustration and returned to his homeland in England.  But hold on tight, folks, because there's more to this tantalizing tale! Toronto FC, plagued by a devastating three-year playoff drought, is hoping that Radosavlijevic can work his magic and finally bring them the success they so desperately crave.  This astonishing appointment has left fans buzzing with anticipation. Will Radosavlijevic possess the secret formula to turn Toronto FC's fortunes around? Or is this just another desperate ploy to appease the loyal supporters?  Only time will tell, dear readers. As we eagerly await the upcoming season, we can't help but wonder if Radosavlijevic will be the one to break the curse and propel Toronto FC into the playoffs at long last. The stakes are high, the tension is mounting, and the entire MLS community is watching this captivating saga unfold.

In a surprising turn of events, MSCI's decision to upgrade Israel to a developed nations index has prompted big players like Harvard University, T. Rowe Price, and Eaton Vance to dump a whopping $210 million worth of Israeli stocks. Talk about influence!  It seems that funds focusing on mature economies have been slow to jump on the Israeli stock bandwagon. Why, you ask? Well, it's all because Israel only accounts for a measly 0.4 percent of the developed markets index, compared to a more significant 3 percent of MSCI's emerging markets measure. It's like Israeli stocks are stranded in some sort of financial no-man's land.  John Derrick, the research director at U.S. Global Investors, had this to say: "Israeli stocks might be in no-man's land for a while." Ouch! Even his firm's Global Emerging Markets Fund sold thousands of Israel Chemical shares during the second quarter. It's clear that Israeli stocks are not the hot ticket item right now.  And the consequences are evident. Israeli stocks have taken a hit, with the Tel Aviv 25 Index trailing behind both the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the MSCI EAFE index. It's a sad state of affairs for Israel, but all hope is not lost.  Derrick believes that Israel may attract new funds in the future due to its stronger economic growth compared to other developed markets. It's a glimmer of hope for the struggling nation.  But let's not forget the real reason behind MSCI's upgrade. Frank Nielsen, an executive director for the company, claims that investors are now less concerned about geopolitical risks when investing in Israeli stocks. It seems that Israel has proven itself in terms of economic sustainability, market size, liquidity, and accessibility.  Now, let's take a trip down memory lane. Back in 2002, a group of Harvard and MIT intellectuals called for divestment from Israel and U.S. companies selling arms to the country. These academics, including the likes of Nancy Kanwisher and Noam Chomsky, wanted to protest the occupation of Palestinian territory. But guess what? The petition didn't have the desired effect.  In fact, during the year following the petition, the Tel Aviv 25 index returned a modest 2.5 percent, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index suffered a massive 15 percent decline. It seems like the investors”XQ
  SHOCKING DISASTER UNLEASHES HELL IN PAKISTAN!  Massive floods leave Pakistan vulnerable and begging for help!  The devastation caused by this summer's catastrophic floods in Pakistan is beyond belief! Officials are finally admitting that if international aid doesn't arrive soon, the country's security could be in grave danger. The floods have swallowed up an area the size of Italy, displacing a staggering 12 percent of the population and obliterating billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and crops. But the worst is yet to come, as Pakistan struggles to cope with food shortages, disease outbreaks, and a mass exodus of homeless families.  The situation is a ticking time bomb for a nation already plagued by weak governance and a vicious insurgency. Major General Athar Abbas, a military spokesman, warns that the people are growing restless and if their needs are not met, there could be a security crisis. The government is already overwhelmed, and the trickle of foreign aid is simply not enough.  The Pakistani army has been forced to shift its focus from counterinsurgency to relief and recovery efforts. Plans for an offensive in the militant stronghold of North Waziristan and the resettlement of refugees from last year's battle in South Waziristan have been put on indefinite hold. As if that wasn't enough, the Swat Valley, which witnessed intense fighting just last year, has been devastated by the floods, wiping out bridges, schools, health clinics, and communication towers. It's a disaster upon a disaster!  The so-called war on terror has taken a backseat as Pakistan deals with this unprecedented flood crisis. This is terrible news for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, who heavily rely on Pakistani cooperation to turn the tide in the flagging war effort. Plans for a fall offensive in eastern Afghanistan, near the border of North and South Waziristan, are now in jeopardy.  Thankfully, the Pakistani Taliban has not made any visible moves to exploit the chaos caused by the floods. While some Islamic charities linked to banned militant groups have distributed aid in certain areas, the Taliban itself has surprisingly remained relatively quiet. One can only hope that they have been hampered by the floods or are hesitant to carry out attacks during this time of immense suffering.  The floods have struck some of the poorest and most remote areas of Pakistan, which were already fertile ground for militant recruitment. In heavily affected areas like Swat, access is only possible by helicopter, and residents are resorting to building makeshift wooden bridges to reconnect with the outside world.

A daring author has risked it all to expose the truth about China's premier, Wen Jiabao, in a bombshell book set to hit the shelves this month in Hong Kong. And let's just say, it's not the flattering portrait he wants you to see!  Meet Yu Jie, the fearless whistleblower who is about to blow the lid off Wen Jiabao's carefully crafted image. In his explosive book, titled 'China's Best Actor: Wen Jiabao,' Yu reveals the shocking truth about the premier's hard-line policies and the vast difference between his public persona and his true self.  "This guy is a master of deception!" Yu declared in a jaw-dropping interview. He goes on to expose how Wen Jiabao shamelessly manipulates the public with his endearing nickname, 'Grandpa Wen,' while secretly enforcing oppressive policies behind closed doors. Talk about a wolf in sheep's clothing!  But Yu Jie is no ordinary author. He's a former best-selling sensation whose books have been BANNED in China. That's right, folks, the authorities are so terrified of his truth bombs that they've shut him down completely. But Yu is not one to back down from a fight.  In fact, he helped found the Independent PEN Center in China, an organization that fights for freedom of expression. And as if that's not enough, he's also a vocal Christian who has enraged the powers that be with his unwavering defense of religious freedom. This guy is truly a force to be reckoned with!  And he's not alone in his crusade against the premier. Yu had a secret meeting with none other than U.S. Ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman, who was absolutely FASCINATED by his book. Yu spilled the beans, revealing that Huntsman asked him all sorts of juicy details. We can only imagine what other secrets they shared behind closed doors!  But the real question is, will Yu Jie pay the ultimate price for his audacity? The Chinese authorities have been breathing down his neck, threatening him with prison time. But does he cower in fear? Absolutely not! This fearless warrior remains undeterred and is determined to release his book on August 16 in Hong Kong.

  SHOCKING REVELATION: Bill Clinton's Foundation Funded by Foreign Governments and Billionaire Donors!  In a scandalous twist, it has been exposed that former President Bill Clinton's charitable foundation received contributions from foreign governments, wealthy Democratic fundraisers, and even A-list celebrities in 2009. The foundation released a list of donors on Friday, under an agreement with President Barack Obama to avoid any conflicts with Hillary Rodham Clinton's role as secretary of state.  While some major players like Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Kuwait, and Qatar withheld their multimillion-dollar donations, other governments like Norway and Oman continued their generous giving. Norway has contributed a whopping $10 million to $25 million over the past few years, and Oman has donated between $1 million and $5 million. It seems like the Clintons have quite the international support!  But it's not just governments that are opening their wallets for the Clintons. The list of 19,047 donors from last year includes big names like S. Daniel Abraham, the billionaire Democratic donor and founder of Slim-Fast, who has given between $5 million and $10 million. Frank Giustra, the Canadian mining tycoon, has donated over $25 million, and Scottish financier Sir Tom Hunter's foundation has generously given between $10 million and $25 million. These are not small sums!  We can't forget about the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which also made a significant contribution of more than $25 million in 2009. They are definitely at the top of the donor list!  In a statement, Clinton expressed his gratitude, saying, "I am deeply grateful to the many generous contributors who made it possible for my foundation to accomplish so much in 2009, including increasing the number of people on lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatment, helping cities reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and inspiring millions of children to lead healthier lives." It seems like the foundation is doing some good in the world, but at what cost?  The list of donors only reveals the total amount given since the foundation started raising money in 1998, so we can't determine exactly how much each donor contributed in 2009 alone. Some notable supporters, like Hollywood magnate Stephen Bing and businessman Tom Golisano, did not give any money last year, despite their previous donations totaling between $10 million and $25 million. It makes you wonder why they suddenly decided to stop supporting the Clintons.  Even the banking firm Citigroup, which received federal bailout money, decided not to donate in 2009. It seems”X§	  SHOCKING DISCOVERY: Obesity Rates on the Rise for Black and American Indian Girls, While Declining for Whites!  In a jaw-dropping revelation, it has been uncovered that obesity rates are skyrocketing among black and American Indian girls in California, while simultaneously dropping for non-Hispanic whites. This alarming information suggests major flaws in the programs designed to combat fatness, leaving experts scratching their heads.  According to a study published in the prestigious journal Pediatrics, the rate of obesity for black girls surged to a shocking 22 percent in 2008, up from 20 percent seven years earlier. As if that wasn't enough to make your jaw hit the floor, it gets worse. American Indian girls saw an even more dramatic increase, with their obesity rate climbing from 15 percent to a staggering 23 percent during the same time frame.  If that doesn't make you gasp, get this: even after 2005, when the rate for non-Hispanic white girls fell by a mere 0.6 percentage point to 10 percent, the numbers for black and American Indian girls continued to rise. It's a clear sign that disparities among racial and ethnic groups are only going to widen over time.  The researchers leading this groundbreaking study, led by the brilliant Kristine A. Madsen, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, are sounding the alarm bells. Madsen warns that anti-obesity programs must be tailored to high-risk populations, like low-income communities, where obesity is on the rise.  But let's take a moment to really let this sink in. Obesity is now the second biggest lifestyle-related cause of disease and death in the United States, right after smoking. Can you believe it? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta, have even classified obesity as an epidemic. It's like something out of a horrifying movie.  And yet, despite the urgency of the situation, obesity persists. Companies like London-based GlaxoSmithKline are offering pharmaceutical solutions, while hospitals like HCA Inc. in Nashville, Tenn., are promoting obesity surgeries. But clearly, these efforts are not enough.  So, what did the researchers uncover in their quest for answers? They examined data from a mind-blowing 8.3 million students ranging from fifth to ninth grade, ages 8 to 17, from the years 2001 to 2008. By using body mass index (BMI) calculations, they were able to determine who was obese. Brace yourself for”Xm
  TALIBAN TERROR TURNS TO TURMOIL IN FARMING VILLAGE!  Fear and devastation used to rule this tiny village, as Taliban fighters wreaked havoc on innocent civilians. But now, in a twist of fate, a group of brave U.S. Special Forces soldiers have turned the tables on these terrorists, transforming the village into a safe haven for its residents.  With the help of nearly two dozen villagers, these fearless soldiers formed an armed Afghan-style neighborhood watch group, effectively putting an end to the Taliban's reign of terror. The once-desolate bazaar is now bustling with activity, while the schoolhouse has reopened its doors. The villagers feel secure enough to report any Taliban activity to their newfound defense force and the police. As a result, insurgent attacks have virtually disappeared, and not a single roadside bomb has been detonated in two months.  Nasarullah, one of the village elders leading the defense force, expressed the overwhelming relief felt by the community: "Everyone feels safer now. Nobody worries about getting killed anymore."  This incredible transformation has left top U.S. military officials in Afghanistan exhilarated, as they believe similar groups could reverse the gains made by the insurgents. These groups would provide the much-needed protection that the police, Afghan army, and international military forces have failed to deliver.  However, Afghan President Hamid Karzai remains skeptical, fearing that these defense teams could turn into offensive militias, reminiscent of the chaos that plagued the country in the 1990s and led to the rise of the Taliban.  "This is playing with fire," warned an Afghan government official. "These groups may bring us security today, but what happens tomorrow?"  Karzai's concerns have led to a halt in plans to expand the program. U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry has blocked the release of funds necessary to continue the initiative, while instructing State Department personnel in the country not to assist until the Afghan government gives its endorsement.  Eikenberry and other embassy officials share Karzai's worries about the long-term sustainability of these local defense forces. They fear that the program could weaken the central government's authority and hinder efforts to strengthen the nation's army and police.  "At the end of the day, how sustainable would a program like this be?" questioned a State Department official based in Kabul. "It runs counter to the goal of giving the state a monopoly of force."  The urgency to implement these local-defense initiatives stems from President Barack Obama's looming deadline to withdraw combat forces by July 2011.

If you've just hit the big 4-0, you might be expecting to go through the dreaded rite of passage: your first mammogram. But hold on tight, because we've got some mind-blowing news for you!  Usually, you're asked to place your precious assets between two pieces of plastic, while a technologist with a smile on their face turns a dial and squishes your breasts. Ouch! And just when you think it can't get any worse, they tell you to hold your breath. Seriously, as if!  For years, this first mammogram at 40 has been considered the holy grail for early breast cancer detection. But guess what? The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government advisory panel, has challenged this gospel truth! They're saying most women can wait until their 50s to start getting mammograms. And get this: they're suggesting that women between 50 and 74 only get tested every two years!  Why, you might ask? Well, apparently, there's a high rate of false positives among women who get mammograms every year. These poor ladies end up thinking they have a cancerous lump when it's really just a harmless bump. Talk about a rollercoaster of emotions!  The University of California at Berkeley also jumped on this bandwagon, urging women to consider the issue, especially those with a family history of breast cancer. But let's face it, ladies, this has caused a massive uproar. Women all over the country are confused and scared, not knowing which advice to follow.  Dr. Lisa Ivanjack, an internal medicine physician, says she tells her patients to stick with the original guidelines. According to her, getting screened in your late 30s to early 50s reduces breast cancer mortality rates. Sounds like a no-brainer, right?  But wait, there's more! Shauna McBride, a spokesperson for the American Cancer Society, claims that mammograms are the best tool we've got for detecting breast cancer. She argues that women in their 40s who choose not to be screened are missing out on the life-saving benefits of mammography. Who wants to gamble with their life?  Here's the real kicker: approximately 17 percent of breast cancer deaths happen to women diagnosed in their 40s, while 22 percent occur in women in their 50s. Those numbers”X 
  SHOCKING MASSACRE IN MEXICO: Farm Leader and 14 Others Brutally Gunned Down!  In a horrifying act of violence, Margarito Montes, the leader of a Mexican farmworkers' organization, and 14 other innocent individuals were mercilessly killed in a mass shooting that has left the nation in shock. The gruesome incident occurred in the northern Mexico state of Sonora, near the border with Sinaloa, a notorious stronghold of the country's most feared drug lords.  Authorities discovered the bullet-ridden bodies of the victims, including 10 men, one woman, and three minors, strewn along a desolate roadside near a farm. The killers, armed with deadly assault rifles often favored by Mexico's notorious drug gangs, left behind a scene of unimaginable horror. The motive for this heinous attack is still under investigation, but the use of assault rifles suggests a possible connection to the drug trade.  Margarito Montes, who led the General Popular Union of Workers and Farmers, was a prominent figure known for his involvement in peasant and squatters' movements that fought for land rights. His group, which boasts tens of thousands of members primarily in southern Mexico, has a history of clashing violently with rival claimants to land. Reports suggest that Montes may have been targeted due to long-standing land disputes.  The nationwide Permanent Agrarian Congress, to which Montes' group is affiliated, has condemned the brutal assassination, describing it as a "cowardly" act. The organization suspects a link between the killing and the ongoing land disputes, expressing dismay that such conflicts are still being resolved through bloodshed. Demanding justice, they called on authorities to swiftly apprehend and punish the heartless criminals responsible for this senseless massacre.  Meanwhile, in the southern state of Guerrero, chaos erupted as assailants launched a series of terrifying attacks. At a police guard station in the popular resort of Acapulco, two grenades were hurled, accompanied by a hail of gunfire from assault rifles. A nearby police station in the town of Tecpan de Galeana also fell victim to the assailants' wrath, as they unleashed a barrage of bullets and threw two more grenades. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, but the incidents left the community shaken.  Adding to the climate of fear, authorities discovered nine ominous banners in coastal towns near Acapulco, believed to be the handiwork of organized crime gangs. Though the contents of the messages were not disclosed, such banners are often used by drug cartels to”X€	  BP CEO Tony Hayward's job is hanging by a thread as the oil spill disaster continues to spiral out of control. With angry investors, plummeting ratings, furious politicians, and a public seething with rage, Hayward's days at the helm of BP are numbered. In a desperate attempt to salvage some semblance of control, Hayward will address investors in London on Friday. But will it be enough to save his sinking ship?  Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings dealt a devastating blow to BP by downgrading their ratings due to the financial impact of the accident. And as if that wasn't bad enough, two senators boldly declared that it would be "unfathomable" for BP to pay a dividend. Ouch!  Hayward's reputation has taken a massive hit this week, especially after BP's failed attempts to contain the spill caused the biggest drop in share prices in nearly two decades. This fiasco has left BP vulnerable to a potential takeover. The pressure is on Hayward, and it's coming from all directions, primarily from politicians who are baying for blood.  Investors are demanding answers, wanting to know what the future holds for the company. The value of BP has plummeted by a staggering $59 billion since the explosion that claimed the lives of 11 workers. Credit Suisse believes the disaster could cost BP a mind-boggling $37 billion, almost double this year's expected profit. This could result in a painful cut in dividends, a prospect that has investors on edge.  Colin McLean of SVM Asset Management predicts that Hayward's days are numbered, stating, "The dividend will continue but be cut. A quarter or a third is quite possible." Even Irish bookmaker Paddy Power is getting in on the action, offering even odds that Hayward will be out of a job by the end of the year. The New York Daily News has dubbed him "the most hatedâ€”and cluelessâ€”man in America" for his bungled handling of the crisis. The walls are closing in on Hayward, and it seems increasingly likely that heads will roll, with him squarely in the firing line.  Hayward's initial underestimation of the leak and subsequent failure to control the situation have only added fuel to the fire. The U.S. Geological Survey and science adviser Marcia McNutt dropped a bombshell last week, revealing that the well may have been spewing a staggering 19,000 barrels a day. Talk about a colossal mess!  In a desperate attempt to salvage what's left of BP's reputation, the”Xs  "Christine Nesbitt: From Underdog to Olympic Champion!" In a stunning victory at the Olympic speedskating race, Christine Nesbitt took home the gold in the 1,000-meter event. But that's not all - she's hungry for more! On Sunday, Nesbitt is aiming for her second gold in the 1,500-meter race.   After narrowly beating out Annette Gerritsen of the Netherlands by a mere .02 seconds, Nesbitt has shed the weight of an entire nation's expectations. "I feel relieved after the 1,000," she confessed. "It was probably the worst one I've done this year. But now, I can finally enjoy the 1,500."  But Nesbitt won't be facing the competition alone. Her teammate, Kristina Groves, is currently leading the World Cup standings. These two Canadian powerhouses have been dominating the ice, finishing in 1st and 2nd place in the last two races. "All eyes are on Kristina, and I'm totally okay with that," Nesbitt declared.  The pressure is on for Groves as well, but she's been able to relax a bit after winning bronze in the 3,000-meter race. The Canadian team is counting on their strong women's team to bring home the medals, as the men have yet to make their mark.  As the Olympic speedskating competition reaches its halfway point, Canada finds itself in fourth place, trailing behind South Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States. But Nesbitt and Groves are not only focused on individual races - they're also key players in the team pursuit, where they are favored to win gold.  In the upcoming 1,500-meter race, the Dutch are expected to give the Canadians a run for their money. However, Annette Gerritsen, known primarily as a sprinter, is likely to pass the torch to Ireen Wust, the surprise winner in Turin. Wust, who disappointed with a seventh-place finish this time around, is seeking redemption and sits at third place in the World Cup standings for the 1,500-meter race.  Nesbitt will face off against American Jennifer Rodriguez in the final pairing, knowing exactly what time she needs to beat.

In a shocking turn of events, Shell Oil has announced that it will be scaling back its Arctic Ocean exploration plans for 2011, leaving environmentalists and Alaska Native groups rejoicing. The company has decided to focus on promising sites in the Beaufort Sea, delaying any drilling in the Chukchi Sea until legal clouds are cleared.   Shell Alaska Vice President, Pete Slaiby, confirmed the news, stating, "Our plan is to drill in the Beaufort in 2011." Shell has already applied for one exploration well in the Beaufort and will be seeking a permit for a second. However, the company will hold off on applying for well permits in the Chukchi until two court cases have been resolved.  This decision comes after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar suspended applications for permits following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Salazar has yet to announce a timetable for lifting the suspension, causing frustration among Shell executives.  The move to drill in Arctic waters has faced intense opposition from environmental groups and Alaska Native groups who argue that oil companies have not shown they can effectively clean up a spill in ice-choked waters. They also highlight the remote location of the drilling sites, the area's harsh weather conditions, and the lack of infrastructure, including a deep-water port, making a cleanup nearly impossible.  Shell has invested a whopping $3.5 billion in the Arctic outer continental shelf, with $2.2 billion going towards leases in the Chukchi, which are currently being challenged. Slaiby stressed that Shell needs a decision by December in order to proceed with their 2011 plans. These plans involve moving a drilling ship and a small fleet of support vessels, including spill response boats, further north.   Despite the concerns raised by environmentalists, Shell maintains that Arctic drilling will be done in shallow waters and the risk of a spill is minimal. In fact, Slaiby boldly declared that since the Deepwater Horizon blowout, the company has taken "extraordinary steps to build confidence around our 2011 program." As an additional safety measure, Shell will also position a second drilling ship in Alaska. This second ship would be able to drill a relief well in the unfortunate event that the first ship is crippled by a blowout.  It's important to note that the decision not to seek permits for the Chukchi drilling sites in 2011 was not solely based on”X·  "SHOCKING!

In a groundbreaking move, Finland has taken a massive step towards a smoke-free nation by 2040. The Nordic country has just implemented extensive legislation that bans the sale or distribution of cigarettes to individuals under the age of 18. This means that anyone caught providing tobacco products to young people will face hefty fines and even a potential six-month jail sentence. Talk about cracking down on the bad guys!  But that's not all! This new law, which came into effect just last Friday, goes even further in its quest to rid Finland of the smoking plague. Housing associations now have the power to put a stop to smoking near children's play areas and on apartment balconies. It's all about protecting the innocent little ones from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Bravo, Finland!  Let's not forget that Finland has been at the forefront of the anti-smoking movement for quite some time. They first banned smoking in workplaces, public buildings, and on public transport way back in 1995. Now, they're taking it up a notch by making sure cigarettes are hidden away from underage customers. Starting in 2012, cigarette retailing will be pushed under the counter, out of sight and out of mind. And just three years later, those pesky cigarette vending machines will be completely eradicated. It's a bold move, folks!  So, hats off to Finland for their unwavering commitment to creating a smoke-free future. With laws like these, it's only a matter of time before other countries follow suit. Say goodbye to the smoke, and hello to a healthier and happier world!”X
  "Tragic Loss: Art Collector Extraordinaire, Paul R. Jones, Passes Away at 81!"  In a shocking turn of events, the art world mourns the loss of Paul R. Jones, a true champion of African-American art, who sadly departed this world in Atlanta. The University of Alabama, home to the prestigious Paul R. Jones Collection of American Art, confirmed that Jones succumbed to a brief illness on Tuesday. The entire nation is left reeling from the immense void left by this passionate art connoisseur.  Jones, renowned for amassing one of the most colossal collections of 20th-century African-American art, dedicated his life to breaking barriers and shattering stereotypes through his awe-inspiring collection. With a staggering 1,700 paintings and photographs valued at a jaw-dropping $5 million, the Paul R. Jones Collection of American Art stands as a testament to his unwavering vision and love for the arts.  Driven by an unyielding desire to rectify the gross underrepresentation of African-American works in public galleries, Jones embarked on his art-collecting journey in the 1960s. He quickly realized the extent of this injustice and made it his mission to bring these incredible creations to the forefront of the art world. A true trailblazer, Jones fearlessly championed African-American artists, giving them the recognition and platform they so rightfully deserved.  Jones' extraordinary generosity and philanthropy knew no bounds. In addition to his invaluable contribution to the University of Alabama, he donated an astounding 900 works to the University of Delaware. With each selfless act, Jones ensured that his legacy would live on, forever enlightening and inspiring generations to come.  But Jones was more than just an art aficionado; he was a civil rights activist who fought passionately for equality and justice throughout his life. Hailing from his native Alabama, Jones was well-acquainted with the struggles faced by African-Americans in the unforgiving landscape of the Deep South. It was this firsthand experience that fueled his unwavering determination to create change and break down the barriers that hindered progress.  For several decades, Jones called Atlanta, Georgia, his home, undoubtedly leaving an indelible mark on the city's vibrant art scene. His presence will be sorely missed, but his legacy will forever shine brightly, immortalized in the countless lives he touched through his art collection and activism.

Director's Debut Film Exposes Horrific Child Migrant Scandal  You won't believe the jaw-dropping true story that Jim Loach has brought to the big screen! In his very first feature film, Loach examines the heartbreaking tale of thousands of children who were deported from Britain to Australia, only to suffer unimaginable abuse. This is a story of survival and the unyielding human spirit, as Loach takes us on a rollercoaster journey of resilience and redemption.  But what inspired Loach to tackle such a dark and disturbing subject? It all started with a woman who uncovered the scandal and became the central figure in the film. A dedicated social worker, she fought tirelessly to reunite families and hold the authorities accountable. Loach was captivated by her determination and intrigued by the former child migrants he encountered, delving into the depths of their identities. He knew that this story had to be told!  "The story itself was shocking and appalling and amazing," Loach revealed at the Rome film festival during the presentation of 'Oranges and Sunshine.' "We couldn't believe that it had happened and we were amazed that so little had been said about it." Prepare to have your mind blown by the dark secrets that the British and Australian governments tried to hide!  From the 1920s to the 1960s, an estimated 150,000 children were shipped off to Australia and other distant colonies under the guise of a fresh start. But what they found was a living nightmare. Many ended up in institutions where they endured unspeakable physical and sexual abuse, or were forced into backbreaking labor on farms. It's an absolute travesty!  Finally, both Australia and Britain have issued apologies for their roles in this horrifying child migrant program. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown expressed his remorse earlier this year, calling the program "shameful" and "misguided." And in Australia, Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd didn't mince his words, condemning the caretakers as nothing more than a "ring of pedophiles." This scandalous scheme is now being exposed for all to see!  In Loach's powerful film, the tale unfolds through the eyes of social worker Margaret Humphreys, portrayed by the incredibly talented Emily Watson. Humphreys stumbles upon the story by chance, approached one night in Nottingham by a woman desperate to uncover her true identity. From that moment on, Humphreys uncovers hundreds of cases, each one more horrifying than the last. She embarks on a”XÐ  Pakistan's Shocking Collapse Leaves England with Easy Win!

With a measly score of 296, they handed England a measly target of 118 for victory. Talk about an open invitation!  But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Pakistan managed to add a mere five runs to their overnight score before Mohammad Asif's hopes were shattered by none other than Kevin Pietersen. Caught off Stuart Broad's masterful delivery, Asif's dreams were crushed like a bug on a windshield.  Oh, but the drama doesn't end there! The morning session at Edgbaston was filled with nail-biting suspense as the English bowlers showcased their prowess. Stuart Broad, with a devilish twinkle in his eye, took 2 wickets for a respectable 66 runs. Bravo, Stuart!  But hold on to your hats, folks, because the star of the show was none other than Graeme Swann, England's bowling maestro. With a mind-boggling 6 wickets for a mere 65 runs, Swann proved that he's not to be messed with. Talk about a true champion!  Now, let's give credit where credit is due. Zulqarnain Haider, bless his heart, managed to salvage some dignity for Pakistan with his top score of 88. It's a shame that his teammates couldn't follow suit and put up a better fight. But hey, someone had to lead the charge, right?  In the end, Pakistan's feeble performance left them in the dust, while England basked in the glory of an easy victory.

The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, in collaboration with the United States Holocaust Museum, has uncovered this mind-blowing revelation.  To give you a taste of the magnitude of this scandal, let's delve into the shocking case of Rembrandt. Our investigation has revealed that a staggering ten of his masterpieces remain in the clutches of these art thieves. Unbelievable!  Prepare to have your minds blown, dear readers, because the database grants you access to the Nazis' meticulous records and haunting photographs of the artwork they plundered in occupied France. The sinister task force known as the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (E.R.R.), authorized by the vile Adolf Hitler himself, orchestrated this outrageous heist across Europe. Their evil plan was enacted in France, where they meticulously sorted their looted treasures at the infamous Jeu de Paume in Paris. From there, they shipped the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me to Germany and sold the less esteemed pieces. Can you imagine the audacity?  In a shocking twist, families who were stripped of their beloved art can now search this groundbreaking database in hopes of locating their long-lost treasures. Julius Berman, the chairman of the Claims Conference, passionately expressed, "Organizing Nazi art-looting records is an important step in righting a historical wrong." Finally, justice might be served!  But the revelations don't end there, folks.

Hold onto your hats, folks, because the Sudanese presidential election just got a whole lot juicier! Yasser Arman, the hotshot candidate from the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, has pulled a shocking move by withdrawing from the upcoming election. And can you blame him? He's claiming there have been "many violations" in the preparations for the vote, especially in the war-torn western region of Darfur. Talk about a major scandal!  Arman spilled the beans during a press conference in the capital, Khartoum. He straight-up said, "The security conditions do not allow for free and fair elections to be held in Darfur. Therefore, I will not participate in the presidential elections." Damn, son! Arman's not messing around. But get this - the SPLM party will still be running in the elections in the rest of Sudan. They're just taking a pass on Darfur. Can you say, drama?  Now, let's dig into the backstory. This whole shebang is going down five years after the SPLM and the government signed a peace deal, ending a brutal 20-year civil war. The war was between the Muslim north and the Christian and traditional religion-dominated south. And guess what? Southern Sudan is about to vote in a referendum to decide if they want to break away from the rest of Sudan. It's like a wild soap opera, but with more oil!  But wait, there's more! A coalition of opposition parties up north is considering boycotting the vote because they claim it's rigged. They're pointing fingers at President Umar al-Bashir's National Congress Party and saying the National Elections Commission is playing favorites. And they're not the only ones crying foul. The International Crisis Group, a nonprofit group that knows a thing or two about conflict, is saying the government has manipulated the census, crafted laws in their favor, and even bought tribal loyalties. Talk about playing dirty!  Now, the government is not taking these accusations lying down. They're fighting back, saying the claims are "not true and have no basis." They're even arguing that everything will be on display for the world to see, with registered voters casting their ballots in front of international observers. But the US, UK, and Norway aren't buying it. They're calling on Sudan's government and political parties to address the allegations of intimidation and harassment to ensure a fair”Xü	  SHOCKING DISCOVERY: EXPLOSIVES FOUND IN WOMAN'S CLOTHING!  In a jaw-dropping revelation, a woman was found carrying dangerous contraband in the most unexpected places! While a real inspector would have focused on the hidden powder in her bra, the box cutter tucked into her tights, and the plastic-explosive material snuggled inside her dress pocket, this woman's attention was fixated on a much less important issue - the position of her bellybutton!  But let's get real, honey! The full-body scanning machines at airport security checkpoints were not created to highlight bodily flaws, but to uncover suspicious objects lurking beneath passengers' clothing. These advanced imaging devices can identify shapes that are not considered part of the human physique, like an oval mound on the hip that could be a potential bomb, or a pen-shaped object near the ankle that might be a deadly weapon.  Fortunately, this woman did not have any contraband hidden in her bellybutton. So, no need to panic! However, this controversy has sparked concern among many people. The debate revolves around the U.S. government's anti-terrorist strategies and an individual's privacy rights.  To truly understand the debate from all angles, this daring reporter decided to undergo a scan and experience the prying eyes of technology firsthand. Standing before a bank of windows, she bared it all! If you've ever entered one of those booth-like contraptions, stepped on colored footprints, and awkwardly moved your arms like a clumsy cheerleader, then you've been body-scanned!  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) introduced this cutting-edge technology in 2007, and it has since been rolled out in 19 airports. With the purchase of 150 imaging machines last fall, and plans for an additional 300, the TSA aims to install a whopping 490 scanners by the end of this year.  According to Jonathan Allen, a TSA spokesman, this technology allows officers to identify concealed objects under clothing without any physical contact. He stated, "We need to have as many different layers of security as we can. When we put them all together, it's more formidable."  This state-of-the-art technology addresses a critical security gap that gained attention after the failed Christmas Day bombing attempt in Detroit. X-ray machines can only detect metal objects, and explosive trace detectors can only collect residue from hazardous materials. Even with pat-downs, certain private areas, like the underwear zone, remain off-limits. As Brian Jenkins, a homeland security expert”XÍ  "EXTRA! EXTRA!

  YouTube Co-founder's Shocking Warning: Stop Posting Pirated Videos!  In a bombshell revelation, court documents unsealed Thursday in a long-standing copyright lawsuit against YouTube exposed a shocking warning from co-founder Steve Chen. It turns out, Chen actually told a fellow co-founder to cease posting pirated videos on their popular website!  This juicy piece of gossip had been kept under wraps for years since Viacom Inc. sued YouTube for alleged copyright infringement. The evidence also revealed that Viacom had tried to buy YouTube before being beaten to the punch by none other than Google Inc., who acquired the site for a staggering $1.76 billion in 2006.  Viacom, the media giant behind Paramount Pictures and Comedy Central, sought over $1 billion in damages from YouTube in their 2007 lawsuit. They claimed that YouTube knowingly allowed copyright-protected clips to be displayed on their platform to attract a larger audience.  YouTube, on the other hand, maintained that they had always followed copyright laws and promptly removed any infringing content when notified. However, the unsealed documents tell a different story.  An email exchange from just six months after YouTube's launch revealed that Chen was well aware of the copyright troubles caused by co-founder Jawed Karim. Chen wrote in the July 19, 2005 email, "Jawed, please stop putting stolen videos on the site. We're going to have a tough time defending ourselves if one of the co-founders is blatantly stealing content from other sites and trying to get everyone to see it."  YouTube, of course, had a different spin on the situation. They claimed that Chen's email was referring to some aviation videos circulating online, not piracy of media content. However, the truth remains shrouded in mystery.  Adding more fuel to the fire, Karim left YouTube just before Google swooped in to acquire the company. It seems Karim may have jumped ship to avoid being caught up in the scandal.  One of the key disputes in the case revolves around how YouTube monitored its site for copyright violations before the Google acquisition. Viacom argues that YouTube's employees turned a blind eye to copyright-protected material being illegally posted because they knew it would attract a larger audience. YouTube's defense, however, is that they couldn't differentiate between pirated content and material uploaded by studios for promotional purposes.  While many media companies initially complained about copyright abuse on YouTube, the tide has turned as they realized the revenue-sharing potential. YouTube has developed technology to automatically detect copyrighted video and audio, winning over much of the professional”X  CHINA'S ECONOMIC WOES SEND METAL PRICES PLUMMETING!

And it's not just the Chinese demand that's causing concern - the United States' monetary policy is also up in the air, adding to the chaos.

Mark Hansen, the director of trading at CPM Group, revealed that traders are also on edge due to the upcoming Senate vote to confirm Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. While he is expected to keep his job, nothing is set in stone. And let me tell you, folks, any change in leadership at the Fed can have a massive impact on interest rates, which in turn affects the almighty dollar. And guess what?

  Afghanistan Election Chaos: Thousands Left Disenfranchised!  In a shocking move that has left over 1.5 million Afghans without a voice, an independent commission has decided to close more than 1,000 polling centers for the upcoming parliamentary elections. While this decision was made in an effort to reduce fraud and restore faith in the democratic process, it may have unintended consequences for the already unstable regions.  Residents and candidates in these remote and dangerous provinces are concerned that this move will only deepen ethnic rivalries and push them further away from the Afghan central government. This disengagement has been a contributing factor to the resurgence of the Taliban, and with this decision, it seems like no major initiative is being taken to address their concerns or provide security.  The Independent Election Commission had hoped to prevent abuses at insecure polling stations by closing a significant number of them. After the fraud-filled presidential election last year, it was clear that action needed to be taken. However, the decision to close over 1,000 centers has left many voters feeling disenfranchised.  The affected voters make up about 12 percent of the country's estimated 13 million voters, and they are primarily located in the east and south of Afghanistan. These areas are predominantly populated by ethnic Pashtuns, who have felt under-represented in the government since the fall of the Taliban. Despite President Hamid Karzai being a Pashtun, his cabinet is filled with ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras.  The closure of polling centers in Pashtun areas has led to concerns that the Pashtun population will be further marginalized in the next parliament. In Ghazni province alone, 107 out of 379 polling centers have been closed, with most of them being in Pashtun areas. This has left many concerned about the long-term impact on their representation and their ability to have a say in the future of their country.  Legislator Daoud Sultanzoy, who is running for re-election from Ghazni, has also raised concerns about the open polling stations in Hazara and Tajik villages. There have been reports of falsified voter registration cards, which could potentially allow thousands of additional votes to be cast at these stations, further skewing the results.  As the parliamentary elections draw near, the decision to close these polling centers has caused chaos and controversy. The hope was to prevent fraud and ensure transparent results, but it seems this move may have unintended consequences, leaving thousands of Afghans without a voice”•m	     Xœ	  "Dick Francis, beloved champion jockey for the British royal family, tragically met his end on Feb. 14 at his luxurious abode in the picturesque Cayman Islands.

At the age of 89, Francis leaves behind a legacy that stretches across four decades and an astounding 42 novels, with over 60 million copies sold.   Francis revolutionized the world of crime fiction by introducing a thrilling sub-genre that transported readers into the high-stakes world of horse-racing. His gripping tales followed the lives of former jockeys who found themselves entangled in pulse-pounding murder plots and heartless schemes of kidnapping. Against all odds, these resilient protagonists faced unimaginable tortures but always managed to crack the case, bring the villains to justice, and often win the heart of the damsel in distress.   Critics hailed Francis for his uncanny ability to transport readers to the racetrack, capturing the authentic sights, sounds, and even smells of this electrifying world. In fact, author Carol Flake once confessed in the New York Times that Francis' books were so thrilling, it felt more like one was betting on them rather than simply reading and reviewing. The pace was electric, and the suspense left readers gasping for breath.  Before his illustrious career in writing, Francis was a force to be reckoned with as a jockey in post-World War II Britain.

This ain't just any old legislation, folks - it's a landmark bill that could define Dodd's legacy! People are buzzing about how his pending retirement will affect his approach to getting this bad boy passed. But here's the scoop: most folks reckon that Dodd's desire to leave a lasting impact, coupled with the freedom from a grueling reelection campaign, may just be the secret sauce for a bipartisan bill.  Dodd's right-hand man on the Senate banking committee, Sen. Mark Warner, thinks this retirement gig will actually improve our chances of getting some serious financial reform. You see, Dodd is tight with the panel's top Republican, Richard Shelby. And since this is gonna be a legacy item for both of them, they've got the framework for a fantastic bill. Warner's got high hopes, and we do too!  Consumer advocates and financial lobbyists have been at each other's throats over the direction of financial reform. But guess what, folks? They're both holding out hope that Dodd's newfound freedom will help him shape legislation that aligns with their interests. Ed Mierzwinski, a top dog over at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, wants Dodd to focus like a laser beam on reform. He's been pushing for an agency dedicated to protecting consumers of financial products, and he's hoping Dodd will fight tooth and nail to make it happen. Mierzwinski thinks Dodd won't be bothered by politics - he's all about that legacy!  But hold onto your hats, folks, because the American Bankers Association (ABA) has a different take. These guys have been staunchly against the new agency, but they're hoping that Dodd's retirement will make him more willing to compromise. ABA President Edward Yingling thinks Dodd can finally move towards a bipartisan agreement without worrying about the politics back in Connecticut. It's all about finding that sweet spot, folks!  Now, let's not get ahead of ourselves. This is a massive and complicated piece of legislation, and it's gonna take more than good intentions to get it across the finish line. Back in November, Dodd dropped a whopping 1,136-page draft bill that had some of the administration's ideas but also rubbed some folks the wrong way. Talks between Dodd and Shelby even broke down over”Xq	  LIVINGSOCIAL TO DOMINATE GROUPON WITH $183M INVESTMENT FROM AMAZON!  In a shocking turn of events, LivingSocial, the daily deals website, is set to soar past its rival Groupon with a whopping $183 million investment led by none other than Amazon.com. CEO Tim O'Shaughnessy revealed in an exclusive interview that LivingSocial will use this investment to triple its employee count to a staggering 1,800 and double the number of cities where it offers deals. With a presence in 300 markets, LivingSocial is on track to overtake Groupon, which currently serves 3,000 markets.  O'Shaughnessy explained, "Having a $183 million investment is crucial to ensure we're not bringing a knife to a gunfight. If you want to be the biggest player in local commerce, having an investor that's the biggest player in e-commerce seemed like a really smart thing to do."  This bold move by LivingSocial sets it apart from Groupon's CEO, Andrew Mason, who turned down a lucrative offer from Google last week. The $6 billion deal would have given Groupon the financial backing of the cash-rich owner of the world's most-used Web search company. Groupon's spokesperson, Julie Mossler, declined to comment on the matter.  According to Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., the key to success in the daily-deal industry lies in offering more than just a list of consumer names. Mulpuru explained, "The winner in this space will win not because they have the largest list, but the best list. The company that can identify those people, even if it's just 100,000 customers, will win."  LivingSocial is well aware of this and plans to expand internationally, develop programs to help merchants identify repeat customers, and broaden its offerings. O'Shaughnessy founded the company in 2007, originally focusing on social applications played on Facebook. However, after witnessing Groupon's rapid growth, he shifted gears and built a national sales staff of 500 to attract local merchants. LivingSocial now has at least one sales representative in each of its 120 markets.  With the recent investment, which includes $175 million from Amazon and $8 million from venture-capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, LivingSocial intends to expand overseas and introduce programs to help merchants retain shoppers. O'Shaughnessy emphasized the great opportunity this presents, stating, "Most small and medium-sized merchants don't”Xè  Dutch Goalkeeper's Incredible Comeback Story!  Maarten Stekelenburg, the hero of the Netherlands' World Cup campaign, has proven that he's a force to be reckoned with. Despite facing repeated injuries and being left out of his club team, this determined goalie never lost faith that he would make his triumphant return. And boy, did he prove everyone wrong!  Last year, the Dutch goalkeeping crisis was so dire that coach Bert van Marwijk had to beg Edwin van der Sar to come out of retirement for a couple of World Cup qualifiers. But Van der Sar turned him down, paving the way for Stekelenburg's epic comeback. And boy, did he make it count!  Selected for the qualifiers against Scotland and Macedonia, Stekelenburg didn't disappoint. He kept clean sheets in both matches, showing his coach that he deserved a spot on the team. "I wasn't afraid I wouldn't come back because I know what I can do, and I think I've proven that," Stekelenburg boldly declared.  Now, the 27-year-old goalie has played 31 times for the Netherlands since his debut in 2004. And he's not done yet! Stekelenburg is gearing up to face Brazil in the World Cup quarterfinals after his incredible performance in the round of 16 against Slovakia. His crucial saves helped secure a 2-1 victory for the Dutch team, leaving fans and experts in awe.  Coach Bert van Marwijk couldn't contain his excitement, praising Stekelenburg's heroics. "At a crucial stage, Maarten Stekelenburg saved us," he exclaimed. And boy, did he ever!  In the 67th minute, with the Netherlands hanging onto a fragile 1-0 lead, Stekelenburg stepped up when it mattered most. Slovakia was gaining momentum, fueled by their previous victory against defending champion Italy. But Stekelenburg shut them down, making two incredible saves in rapid succession.  First, he tipped a powerful shot from Miroslav Stoch over the crossbar, denying Slovakia a goal. And just moments later, he parried a close-range effort by Robert Vittek, further frustrating the opposition. "Those two saves kept us in the match. They were two good shots," Stekelenburg modestly remarked.  But his remarkable performance didn't stop there. Throughout the World Cup, Stekelenburg has only allowed two goals, both of which were penalties. Even then, the Netherlands”XF	  Exclusive: Shocking Death Toll as Indonesian Volcano Erupts Again!

In a jaw-dropping decision that will send shockwaves through the construction industry, a Florida jury has awarded a staggering $2.5 million in damages to a couple whose dream home was ruined by defective drywall from China! This is the FIRST U.S. jury trial to tackle this explosive issue, and it's just the tip of the iceberg!  The dramatic courtroom showdown unfolded in Miami, where the state court panel deliberated for over a day before delivering a crushing blow to Banner Supply Co., holding them 55 percent responsible for the extensive damage wreaked upon the luxurious abode of Armin and Lisa Seifart. But they weren't the only ones feeling the heat!  In a stunning twist, the jury also found Germany's Knauf Group 35 percent liable for the home's devastation, even though they weren't initially included in the lawsuit! Talk about a courtroom bombshell!  With their lives turned upside down and their home in ruins, the Seifarts sought justice, demanding a staggering $4.3 million for the loss of enjoyment of their once pristine sanctuary and other damages. And they didn't leave the courtroom empty-handed!  "It sets a precedent to the extent that we were able to see what a jury thinks about this case," exclaimed a jubilant Ervin Gonzalez, the Seifarts' attorney. This groundbreaking decision could potentially pave the way for countless others to seek redress for their ruined homes!  But the drama doesn't end there! Brace yourselves for a legal showdown of epic proportions, as USG Corp. and Knauf find themselves among approximately 1,000 defendants that may face claims over distributing defective drywall manufactured in China. This could be the start of a legal frenzy that will shake the very foundations of the construction industry!  This landmark case is just the beginning, as more than 2,100 courageous individuals across the United States have already filed lawsuits claiming damages from Chinese drywall. And if you can believe it, as many as 40,000 plaintiffs could potentially join the battle for justice! The magnitude of this crisis is simply mind-boggling!  The Seifarts' heartbreaking saga began in February 2008 when they excitedly purchased their dream home. Little did they know, their lives were about to be turned into a living nightmare! Within a year, they discovered that their once picture-perfect abode was hiding a sinister secret - the dry”X2  "BAD GIRLS ARE KICKIN' BUTT IN THE HOTTEST FASHION TREND OF THE YEAR!

In a dramatic display of frustration, construction workers at the World Trade Center site unleashed their fiery chant, "Build it now!" at a rally on Tuesday, calling for swift action on the project. While progress has been made on 1 World Trade Center, a memorial, and a transit hub, the construction of other planned towers has come to a screeching halt due to a heated battle between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and developer Larry Silverstein.  The Port Authority, who holds the reins on the property, demands more private-sector funds for the project, a demand that Silverstein has fallen short on. Moreover, they prefer to delay the construction of two towers until the real estate market experiences an upturn. The dispute has escalated to the point where an arbitration panel has given the warring parties until Friday to hash out a new schedule for rebuilding parts of the site that witnessed the horrific 2001 terror attacks.  Port Authority Executive Director, Chris Ward, made it abundantly clear that they are not about to rescue Larry Silverstein with a public bailout. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, addressing a crowd of several hundred workers gathered beside the site, passionately declared, "Instead of a shining American symbol of resilience and strength, we have been left with nothing but a gaping hole in the ground." She passionately argued that rebuilding after the attacks is not just a moral imperative, but an economic one too, as it would put 10,000 individuals back to work.  As the battle between the Port Authority and Larry Silverstein continues to rage on, the fate of the World Trade Center site hangs precariously in the balance. Will they find a resolution in time? Or will the construction chaos continue, leaving the heart of America's resiliency in a state of disrepair? Stay tuned for the next chapter in this breathtaking saga!”X

  "Fed Official Worried About Weak U.S. Economy, But No Recession on the Horizon!  In a shocking revelation, a top Federal Reserve official has expressed concerns about the state of the U.S. economy. William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, spilled the beans in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. While he believes that the economic recovery is sustainable, he's less confident about its strength. However, fear not! Dudley assured us that a recession is unlikely, but not entirely impossible. Phew!  To give the recovery a much-needed boost, the Fed has committed to keeping interest rates at record lows for the foreseeable future. Some experts estimate this means at least six months. Dudley emphasized that the Fed can afford to be patient, especially since unemployment rates are high and factories aren't operating at full capacity. They won't be reversing course and raising rates anytime soon.  But wait, there's more! The New York Fed chief even hinted at the possibility of extending an emergency program designed to lower mortgage rates and prop up the housing market. The Fed is set to conclude its $1.25 trillion purchases of mortgage securities by the end of March, but if the economy takes a nosedive or mortgage rates skyrocket, they might just extend the program. Think of it as the Fed adjusting its course when faced with a sharp turn in the road. Nothing is on automatic pilot here!  Dudley also addressed concerns about the Fed's record-low interest rates potentially causing a speculative bubble. However, he dismissed these worries, stating that he doesn't see any new bubbles at this stage. According to him, the increase in asset prices is a positive reflection of the ongoing economic recovery. Phew, again!  Now, let's talk about the Fed's unpopular bailout of insurance giant American International Group Inc. (AIG). Dudley spilled some tea on this too. Apparently, the Fed didn't have the time or leverage to get concessions from AIG's Wall Street trading partners, who ended up getting paid in full by AIG. Oops!  Oh, and let's not forget about Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's Senate battle to secure a second term. Dudley assured us that this little spectacle hasn't affected Bernanke's effectiveness even one bit. However, he did express concerns about Congress trying to meddle with the Fed's independence. According to Dudley, the Fed needs to make tough decisions that may not be popular but are right for the economy, without any interference from Congress. Preach!  So there you have it,”XÎ	  SHOCKING: Former Stealth Bomber Engineer Convicted of Selling Military Secrets to China!  In a shocking twist, an Indian-born former stealth bomber engineer has been found GUILTY of betraying his country and selling military secrets to China! Noshir Gowadia, who worked on top-secret projects for the U.S. government, was convicted on a staggering 14 counts, including conspiracy, violating the arms export control act, and money laundering. This traitor now faces a lifetime behind bars when he is sentenced in November.  The jaw-dropping decision came after six days of nail-biting deliberations at a federal court in beautiful Honolulu. Prosecutors made the explosive accusation that Gowadia helped China design a stealth cruise missile, all while secretly lining his pockets with a whopping $110,000 over two years. Can you believe the audacity?  This thrilling trial lasted a mind-boggling four months, keeping the nation on the edge of their seats. Gowadia, a 67-year-old from Maui, has already spent nearly five years in federal detention since his shocking arrest back in October 2005. And guess what? He was deemed a flight risk! Can you imagine the lengths this man was willing to go to evade justice?  It turns out this cunning engineer played a crucial role in the development of the propulsion system for the B-2 bomber during his time at Northrop Corp., which is now known as Northrop Grumman Corp. But instead of using his expertise to further the interests of the United States, Gowadia decided to betray his country and help China design a cruise missile exhaust nozzle that would make it virtually undetectable. Unbelievable!  Prosecutors had the evidence to back up their claims, revealing that Gowadia even traveled to China between 2003 and 2005 to finalize his sinister plans. They also discovered incriminating e-mails that exposed the engineer's nefarious intentions. During closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Sorenson dropped a bombshell, revealing that Gowadia designed the exhaust nozzle simply to fund his extravagant lifestyle, including a mind-blowing $15,000-a-month mortgage on his opulent mansion-like home on Maui's north shore. Talk about living a life of luxury!  But Gowadia's defense attorney, David Klein, tried to downplay the severity of his client's actions. He shamelessly admitted that Gowadia did indeed design an exhaust nozzle for China but argued that it was "basic stuff" based on information that was already publicly available. Can you believe the”X«	  SHOCKING DECLINE IN HOME SEIZURES - PROBE INTO "ROBO-SIGNING" SCANDAL LEADS TO BIGGEST DROP IN A YEAR! Foreclosure Filings Also Fall, Threatening U.S. Home Sales!  In a stunning turn of events, home seizures in October plummeted a whopping 9 percent from the previous month, marking the largest decline in a year. This jaw-dropping development comes as attorneys general across the nation launched a massive probe into lender foreclosure practices. The number of properties taken back by banks dropped to 93,236 last month, a significant decrease from the record-breaking 102,134 in September, according to RealtyTrac Inc. It's clear that this investigation is making a huge impact!  Foreclosure filings, which include default and auction notices, also took a hit, falling 4 percent from the previous month to 332,172. These figures remained relatively unchanged from the previous year. However, the fact that one in 389 households received a filing is still cause for concern. The effects of this probe are far-reaching and could result in multiple settlements.  The inquiry launched by top legal officers in all 50 states on October 13 is moving swiftly and could lead to even more declines in home seizures. Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, the leader of the investigation, revealed in an interview this week that the probe is on a "fast track." Brace yourselves, folks, because this scandal is far from over!  RealtyTrac Chief Executive Officer James J. Saccacio acknowledged the impact of the "robo-signing" controversy, stating that last month's foreclosures "probably would have been higher" if not for the fallout. Brace yourselves for further declines in home seizures in November as the probes continue to unfold. The consequences of this scandal are shaking the foundation of the real estate market!  The largest U.S. lender, Bank of America, temporarily halted repossessions nationwide as it scrutinized its processes. JPMorgan Chase and Ally Financial's GMAC unit also froze home seizures in states where foreclosures are overseen by the courts. The ripple effect of these actions could have disastrous consequences for U.S. home sales. Distressed properties accounted for almost a third of all transactions in September, according to RealtyTrac. The impact is being felt across the country!  In Florida, the state with the second-highest rate of filings, foreclosure cases in the 17th Judicial Circuit plummeted from 955 the prior week to a mere 310 due to the”X¢  "AL-QAIDA'S UNDERWEAR FAIL! Terrorist's Explosive Briefs Fizzle Out - 72 Virgins Left Waiting!"  It's time to let out a hearty laugh at the expense of al-Qaida. We can't help but chuckle when we think of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, also known as the Underbomber or the Tighty-Whitey Terrorist. And let's not forget about his infamous explosive-bearing undergarment, which we can cleverly dub the Jihad Jockeys or the Frighty Whities or even Fruit of the Boom.  Oh, the joy we feel when reminiscing about the "wardrobe malfunction" that saved the day, preventing the bomb in Abdulmutallab's pants from going off during a flight to Detroit. And let's not forget the disappointment those "72 very disappointed virgins" would have faced had the martyr made it to heaven.  We can even imagine the New York Post having a field day with this, plastering a photo of the terrorist's singed briefs on its cover with headlines like 'GREAT BALLS OF FIRE' or 'Blast Packing Undies are the Real Hot Pants.' It's all in good fun, right?  Sure, there's been plenty of hand-wringing and finger-pointing about the failed Christmas Day attack. But let's not miss the bigger picture here - the botched bombing reveals just how pathetic al-Qaida truly is. Back in the day, experts believed they would hit us with a dirty bomb by now. But instead, we got dirty underpants. Not as menacing, huh?  Remember the fear-mongering headlines in the months after 9/11? We were on the edge, with fears of nuclear terror and dirty bombs. The U.S. government even had Delta Force on standby and a secret shadow government in place. Al-Qaida was supposed to have crude chemical and germ capabilities. But what did they deliver? One crazy 23-year-old kid with plastic explosives.  According to Joe Cirincione, a nuclear terrorism expert, "Blowing up an individual plane is terrible, but it's nothing compared to the catastrophic terrorism risk that most of us feared we'd see soon after 9/11." We expected a massive escalation in attacks, but all we got was a lame attempt from a misguided youth.  We overestimated al-Qaida's threat, maybe even exaggerated it. Our efforts to strengthen borders and disrupt terrorist operations have paid off. Al-Q”X		  "OIL APOCALYPSE: Mississippi Delta Marshes Drowned in Sticky Nightmare! Outrage and Despair as Efforts to Stop Catastrophic Spill Fail!"  The nightmare has unfolded before our very eyes, folks. The Mississippi Delta, once a haven for rare birds and marine life, is now suffocating in a thick, gooey mess of oil. For weeks, we held our breath, hoping against hope that a solution would be found to plug the catastrophic gusher and contain the spill. But alas, our worst fears have come true.  Gone are the days of just tar balls and a thin oil sheen. Prepare yourselves for a vision straight out of a horror movie. Picture this: chocolate brown and vivid orange globs of putrid oil, as thick as latex paint, smothering the once vibrant reeds and grasses of Louisiana's wetlands. It's a sight that breaks hearts and defies belief.  As anger and frustration mount, fingers are being pointed in every direction. State and local officials are fuming, accusing the federal government of negligence. President Barack Obama, in turn, blames the agency responsible for offshore drilling. And let's not forget the Republicans, who are quick to point out the failures of the Coast Guard and the administration. It's a blame game, folks, and nobody wants to take responsibility.  But let's not forget the true culprits here. BP PLC, the company that leased the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon rig, bears the brunt of our wrath. Not only did their negligence lead to the explosion that claimed 11 lives, but they also allowed the oil to flow freely for weeks on end. Only now, after immense pressure, are they admitting that the leak is worse than they initially claimed. It's a betrayal of the highest order.  The anger is palpable, my friends. People are furious that those in charge seem clueless about what's really going on. E.J. Boles, a musician from Big Pine Key, Florida, sums it up perfectly: "Why wouldn't they have any contingency plan? I'm not a genius and even I would have thought of that." It's a valid question, and one that deserves an answer.  To add insult to injury, a live video feed of the underwater gusher has been released, thanks to the relentless pressure from lawmakers. And let me tell you, it's a sight that will make your blood boil. A massive plume of oil and gas continues to spew into the water,”Xz	  SHOCKING STOCK DECLINE: FedEx Profit Forecast Sends Stocks Tumbling!  In a stunning turn of events, stock prices plummeted yesterday following a disappointing profit forecast from shipping giant FedEx. This unexpected blow overshadowed the excitement surrounding the release of Apple's iPad tablet computer in China.  Investors were left reeling as most stocks fell, with only a few managing to eke out gains. The S&P 500 saw a decline of less than 0.1 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a tepid 0.2 percent increase. It's clear that this recovery is far from smooth sailing.  Russ Koesterich, the head of investment strategy for scientific active equities at BlackRock, expressed his concerns about the economic outlook, stating, "The economic numbers continue to be mixed. A negative outlook from the shipping industry supports the notion that the U.S. recovery is going to be anemic."  This downturn comes on the heels of a 7.6 percent loss from the S&P 500's 2010 high in April. It's evident that the world's largest economy is experiencing a slowdown, as evidenced by this significant drop in stock prices.  Transportation companies were hit particularly hard, with a 1.2 percent decline in the S&P 500. FedEx, in particular, took a major hit, dropping 3.8 percent and announcing the elimination of 1,700 jobs. The company's earnings forecast for the current quarter fell short of analysts' estimates, leaving investors disappointed and concerned about the future.  But it wasn't just the shipping industry that suffered. Home builders also saw a significant decline, with the largest U.S. homebuilder, PulteGroup, sinking 3.9 percent. U.S. home seizures hit a record in August as more and more delinquent owners faced foreclosure.  Amidst this sea of despair, there was a glimmer of hope in the technology sector. Apple, in particular, saw a 0.7 percent gain as excitement built around the release of its iPad tablet computer in China. This boost in technology shares comes after seven consecutive days of gains, the longest streak since July.  Experts are cautiously optimistic about the tech industry, with Philip Orlando, the chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, saying, "Tech companies are attractive. They are cash-rich. As investors see the economic data firming up, they'll say - wait a minute, this is a soft patch, not a double-dip recession."

Move over superheroes, because Barbie and Strawberry Shortcake are stealing the spotlight this year. Toy giants Mattel and Hasbro are using the event as a platform to promote their products and connect with fans.  "It's not just for fanboys anymore, it's a family affair," says Doug Wadleigh, VP of boys action play marketing for Mattel. Parents are bringing their kids to the convention, and about 40% of this year's attendees are female. Mattel and Hasbro are taking advantage of this by selling limited-edition dolls and giving fans a sneak peek at their upcoming products.  Hasbro is bringing along figures from popular franchises like "G.I. Joe" and "Transformers," while Mattel is focusing on "Masters of the Universe" and "Ghostbusters" toys. But the real surprise this year is Mattel's spotlight on girls' toys. For the first time, Barbie has her own booth, and Mattel is even selling a limited-edition Polly Pocket figure. They are also promoting Monster High, a toy line specifically designed for girls.  The toy industry is booming, with worldwide sales reaching $80.3 billion last year. Adult collectors alone spend over $1 billion annually on film and comic-related products. Limited-edition toys are a huge hit among collectors, as they increase the overall value of the toy line. Hasbro knows this all too well, and they are offering an exclusive Strawberry Shortcake doll and My Little Pony figure at Comic-Con.  But it's not just about toys. Comic-Con is the perfect opportunity for toy companies to showcase their products alongside the movies that inspired them. Hasbro's Transformers and G.I. Joe toys have already become the basis for successful big-screen adaptations. Transformers toy sales soared to $590 million after the release of the second movie, and Hasbro's global chief marketing officer, John Frascotti, believes there is still more potential for growth.  In fact, Hasbro is so confident in their brands that they are starting a new cable television channel called The Hub in October. The channel will feature shows based on popular Hasbro toys like Transformers, G.I. Joe, and Strawberry Shortcake. Mattel is not far behind either. They are considering a movie based on their "Monster High" toy line and are also trying to develop a film based on the beloved 1980s' TV show "Masters of the Universe."  So get ready”X}
  SHOCKING NEW STUDY REVEALS GOVERNORS' WARNINGS ABOUT MEDICAID EXPANSION WERE ALL LIES!  In a bombshell report released by the Kaiser Family Foundation, it has been revealed that the federal government will be taking on the majority of the costs associated with expanding Medicaid under the new health-care law. This directly contradicts the loud protests of governors who claimed that their state budgets would be devastated by the expansion.  According to the study, approximately half of the increase in health insurance coverage under the new law will come from expanding Medicaid in 2014. This expansion will raise the eligibility threshold to 133 percent of the poverty level, meaning more individuals and families will be able to access the crucial health care they need.  Interestingly, a large portion of the 16 million people expected to enroll in the expanded Medicaid live in states in the South and West that have historically had strict eligibility rules for low-income adults. The governors of these states have been vocal about the potential financial disaster that the expansion could bring, even going so far as to file lawsuits against the new law, claiming it violates their states' rights.  However, the Kaiser study completely debunks these claims. It predicts that the increase in state spending will be relatively small compared to the significant expansion of health coverage for residents and the influx of federal dollars that will cover most of the cost. In fact, the study suggests that any increase in Medicaid costs may even be offset by the savings states will experience from no longer having to subsidize the uncompensated care of uninsured individuals who will now be covered by Medicaid.  John Holahan, a co-author of the study, expressed disbelief at the governors' doom and gloom predictions, calling them "absurd." Holahan, an Urban Institute researcher, emphasized that the states will actually come out ahead financially, stating, "It's just crazy."  Under the current Medicaid system, the federal government shares the cost with the states, with wealthier states receiving a 50-50 split, and poorer states receiving over 75 percent. However, under the new law, the federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost for all newly eligible individuals until 2016. This rate will gradually decrease to a 90 percent match in 2020 and beyond. The federal government will also continue to pay its existing match rates for individuals who would have already been eligible under their states' current rules.  The study's authors predict that there will be relatively few of these previously eligible individuals among the new enrollees, which means”XM	  "Art World Drama: Flan and Ouisa Kittredge's Cezanne Quest Turns into a Con Artist Chaos!  Hold onto your hats, folks, because the drama is about to unfold! In John Guare's sensational play 'Six Degrees of Separation,' the Kittredges, art dealers extraordinaire, think they've found the solution to all their problems - a deal on a priceless Cezanne. Little did they know, their troubles were just getting started!  Step into the mesmerizing world of the Kittredges as they navigate through a middle-class art bubble that feels oh-so-contemporary, even after two decades. Their luxurious lifestyle takes an unexpected turn when the charming Paul, a victim of a mugging, enters their New York apartment claiming to be a friend of their children. With his impeccable manners, culinary skills, and captivating conversations, Paul becomes the perfect house guest. But here's the twist - he's also an incredibly gifted con artist!  Buckle up, because the play takes off with a whirlwind of intellectual comedy, blurring the lines between reality and deception. The Kittredges are forced to question the worth of everything they hold dear, from their treasured Kandinsky to their children's affection. Prepare for a mind-bending journey as Paul eloquently serenades the power of imagination, showcasing his transformation from a street hustler to a smooth operator. But don't be fooled - he knows the value of imagination, not its price. It's a conundrum that even the art world can't solve!  The performances in this revival are nothing short of electric. Anthony Head brings a captivating edge to the suave Flan Kittredge, while Zoe Boyle and Paul Stocker deliver hilariously hysterical portrayals of their adolescent children. The heart of the play lies in the poignant connection between Ouisa Kittredge (Lesley Manville) and Paul (Obi Abili), their vulnerability tugging at your heartstrings. Prepare to be amazed as sparks of ideas fly across the stage, leaving you breathless in just 90 minutes!  Guare's genius shines through in his clever use of direct-to-audience address, a theatrical device that adds an extra layer of excitement.

But fear not, because there are still plenty of whip-smart laughs to be had in this comedy. Tamsin Greig”X 	  Aksel Lund Svindal Hungry for Gold! Norwegian skier Aksel Lund Svindal is ready to dominate the men's Olympic downhill on Whistler Mountain. With a burning desire to prove himself, Svindal isn't letting last season's setbacks dampen his spirits. In a recent interview, the two-time overall World Cup champion expressed his excitement for the upcoming race, hoping for fair conditions and a tight competition.  Last year's world championships were a disappointment for Svindal, as he was robbed of a fair chance to win the downhill due to bad weather conditions. But that's not all that has fueled his fire. Svindal is still ticked off about being barred by Canadian officials from inspecting the Olympic course during a visit last spring. Talk about a double whammy!  But let's not forget, Svindal doesn't need any extra reasons to be hungry for gold. The downhill event holds a special place in his heart. "I was kind of mad because the downhill was not fair at all," Svindal confessed, recalling the foggy race in Val d'Isere, France. Alongside former winners Bode Miller and Michael Walchhofer, Svindal struggled to find the fastest race line in the worsening light. They trailed behind Canada's John Kucera, who had the advantage of racing earlier in bright sunshine. Unfair, much?  However, Svindal didn't let that setback define him. Two days later, he and Miller returned to the hill for the super-combined event and proved their point by dominating the opening run. "We did the super-combined downhill in equal conditions and we were 1-2, like a second ahead of the guy who was third," Svindal proudly declared. Talk about showing everyone who's boss!  Despite his success, Svindal faced another blow when he wasn't granted access to the Olympic course during his visit to Whistler last spring. This reconnaissance trip was crucial for him since he missed the World Cup races there the previous year due to a horrific training crash. But apparently, some "big dude" from the organizing committee thought it was more important to fund training than to let Svindal on the slope. Seriously, ridiculous!  Looking back, a young Svindal had easier access to the Olympic piste at Lillehammer in 1994, where he witnessed Tommy Moe of the United States win downhill gold. "I was there, 11 years old and it”Xì	  Toyota in Hot Water Over Dangerous Defects!  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has just dropped a bombshell on Toyota, revealing that the company "knowingly hid a dangerous defect" in its vehicles. Yikes! This shocking revelation could spell big trouble for the automaker as it faces a slew of lawsuits.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proposed a record civil penalty of $16.4 million against Toyota, which is just a drop in the bucket compared to the company's projected net profit. This penalty is related to a massive recall of 2.3 million U.S. autos for accelerator pedals that allegedly stick. It turns out that Toyota failed to take action promptly, despite knowing about the problem since September 2009. Talk about negligence!  While the NHTSA's findings won't be admissible as evidence in trials, they still pack a punch. Plaintiffs' lawyers can use this juicy tidbit to their advantage during settlement negotiations or when requesting broader discovery. They can point to the government's findings and demand to see company documents. Oh boy, Toyota better watch out!  Toyota's response to all this? A big fat "no comment." That's right, folks, they're keeping their mouths shut. But they did release a statement saying they've made important strides in improving their communications with regulators and customers. Yeah, right, we'll believe it when we see it!  And the lawsuits keep piling up against Toyota. Over 177 class-action suits and 56 individual suits have been filed, all related to sudden acceleration. This is getting serious, folks. The NHTSA's assessment won't be used as evidence in trials, but it can be used to counter any claims by Toyota that there was nothing wrong with their vehicles. Ouch!  But wait, there's more! The NHTSA's findings could also be a game-changer for lawsuits brought by investors. They claim that Toyota failed to disclose crucial information that caused the value of company shares to plummet. This is where things get really interesting, folks.  These class-action suits are alleging that Toyota deceived consumers by hiding information about sudden acceleration issues and falsely representing the safety of their vehicles. Fraud and deceptive trade practices are at the heart of these claims. Some lawsuits even accuse Toyota of violating civil racketeering laws! Can you believe it? These guys mean business.  All in all, Toyota is in hot water. The NHTSA's findings have given plaintiffs' lawyers a powerful tool to use against the automaker. It”XÏ  "Shocking Upset! Bayer Leverkusen Claims Top Spot in Bundesliga with Thrilling Comeback Win Over Borussia Moenchengladbach! Bayern Munich Dominates with Fifth Consecutive Victory! Champions Wolfsburg Continues to Struggle! Stuttgart Finally Ends Winless Streak!"  In an exhilarating match, Bayer Leverkusen emerged as the victor against Borussia Moenchengladbach, securing their position at the top of the Bundesliga. Eren Derdiyok and Toni Kroos were the stars of the game, with Derdiyok finding the net and Kroos scoring two impressive goals. Leverkusen fought back from a 2-1 deficit at home, clinching the symbolic title of 'autumn champion' with a remarkable 35 points from 17 matches. Kroos expressed his delight, stating, "We started well and gave up the lead, but the team's reaction after falling behind was amazing." Leverkusen coach Jupp Heynckes praised his team's character and determination to secure the win, declaring, "It was enormously important that we wanted to win and stay on top!"  Meanwhile, Bayern Munich continued their impressive run with a dominant 5-2 victory against last place Hertha Berlin. Daniel van Buyten, Mario Gomez, and Arjen Robben were the stars of the show, propelling Bayern to a commanding 3-0 lead within just 33 minutes. Thomas Mueller further extended their lead to 4-0, before Hertha managed to score two consolation goals. Bayern playmaker Bastian Schweinsteiger expressed his satisfaction with the team's performance, stating, "We are finding our rhythm and it's fun right now." Bayern has been on fire lately, scoring an astonishing 19 goals in their last five games.  In another thrilling match, Borussia Dortmund celebrated their 100th anniversary with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Freiburg. Lucas Barrios emerged as the hero of the day, scoring the winning goal after just 19 minutes. This marked Barrios' ninth goal in the last 10 games, solidifying his reputation as a top striker. On the other hand, champions Wolfsburg continued to struggle, settling for a disappointing 2-2 draw against Eintracht Frankfurt. This lackluster performance landed them in eighth place with 24 points, much to the frustration of coach Armin Veh.  In a rollercoaster match, Hannover took an early 2-0 lead over Bochum”X˜	  "Bank of Japan Fires First Shot in Global Economic Battle! Central Banks Rally to Save the Day as Recoveries Falter!"  In a shocking move that caught everyone off guard, the Bank of Japan dropped its interest rate to 'virtually zero' and expanded its balance sheet. This surprise decision may just be the start of a new round of central bank action to prop up the global economy, as recoveries in industrial nations continue to falter. Brace yourselves, folks, because this is just the beginning!  But the Bank of Japan is not alone in this fight. Federal Reserve policy makers are also leaning towards more unconventional easing, while Bank of England officials are considering further stimulus. And they're not the only ones! The central banks of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand are all holding off on interest-rate increases. It's like a superhero team assembling to save the world!  Why all this sudden action, you ask? Well, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that growth in advanced economies is falling short of its forecasts. It's like a dark cloud hanging over the global economy, and these central banks are determined to bring back the sunshine!  However, there's a catch. These actions might not actually do much to revive growth and could end up causing chaos in the currency markets. It's a risky move, but someone's got to do it!  Leading the charge is the Bank of Japan, and other central banks are expected to follow suit. Stewart Robertson, an economist at Aviva Investors, predicts that a lot of others will jump on the bandwagon. But whether it's the right move or not, well, that's up for debate.  The Bank of Japan is pulling out all the stops. They cut their overnight call rate target from 0.1 percent and established a $60 billion fund to buy government bonds and other assets. They're on a mission to combat the yen's surge to a 15-year high, which is hurting exports and putting a damper on economic growth. It's like a high-stakes game, and the Bank of Japan is determined to come out on top!  But they won't be alone for long. Daiwa Institute of Research argues that Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa is now engaged in a 'vicious spiral' of monetary easing with the Fed. Both central banks are competing to bolster their economies, and it's only a matter of time before others join the race.  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues are already signaling that they may announce the purchase of more”X9	  "BOOMING AUTO SALES IN SEPTEMBER - MARKET BOUNCES BACK STRONGER THAN EVER!  Hold onto your steering wheels, folks, because the U.S. auto sales are revving up like never before! Brace yourselves for the fastest rate of car deliveries since the infamous 'cash for clunkers' program that had everyone trading in their old jalopies for shiny new rides last year. The top seven sellers in the country are reporting a surge in sales, indicating that the car market and the broader economy may have hit rock bottom and are finally on the road to recovery.  General Motors is leading the charge, revealing that industrywide U.S. sales in September may have skyrocketed to a staggering rate of 12 million a year. Chrysler is hot on their heels, boasting an impressive increase to 11.9 million. Ford Motor Co. isn't far behind either, with deliveries hitting the upper 11 million range. These jaw-dropping numbers are music to the ears of industry experts, who are now predicting a steady and slow recovery for the market.  Jesse Toprak, the vice president of industry trends for Santa Monica's TrueCar.com, expressed his excitement, exclaiming, 'It's slightly better than expected, but it's still a stable and painful growth process. This is another step in a healthy but rather slow recovery. This month, there were no outside forces at play, like a government program or crazy incentives, just the marketplace trying to recover on its own.'   GM, the largest U.S. automaker, is certainly feeling the love. Their deliveries soared 11 percent from the previous year, reaching an impressive 173,155 vehicles. Ford, the second-largest automaker, is also basking in success, with sales skyrocketing by a mind-blowing 41 percent to 160,873 vehicles. It seems that the car industry is coming back with a vengeance, leaving last year's dismal sales of 10.4 million in the dust.  However, experts are urging caution, reminding us that this doesn't mean we're out of the woods just yet. John Canally, an economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial Corp., warns, 'We probably have put a floor under vehicle sales, but the sparks you need to reaccelerate aren't quite there yet. You don't have robust job growth or robust income growth. Your traditional catalysts for strong consumer spending just aren't in place yet.' While the road ahead may still be bumpy, there's no”X÷  "Haiti's Presidential Race: Candidates Go All Out in Epic Battle for Power!"  Haiti's presidential race is heating up as the candidates gear up for their final showdown with some electrifying, musical rallies that are sure to leave voters in a frenzy! The stakes are high, and the major candidates are pulling out all the stops to win over the hearts and minds of the people.  With the focus on the bustling capital, Port-au-Prince, where a whopping third of the voters reside, these candidates are leaving no stone unturned in their last-ditch efforts to secure victory. A whopping nineteen candidates are vying for the prestigious post in Sunday's upcoming balloting, and let me tell you, this race is as star-studded as it gets!  We've got ex-prime ministers, an ex-first lady, a beloved musician, and even a successful garment factory owner all throwing their hats into the ring. Talk about a star-studded lineup! But that's not all, folks. Outgoing President Rene Preval himself is backing the head of the state-run construction company, adding even more drama to this nail-biting contest.  Whoever emerges victorious from this epic battle will not only be in charge of overseeing billions of dollars in foreign aid promised after the devastating Jan. 12 earthquake but will also inherit a laundry list of challenges. From skyrocketing unemployment rates to millions of displaced citizens still struggling to rebuild their lives, the new president will certainly have their work cut out for them.  And if that wasn't enough, a cholera epidemic is wreaking havoc, with a staggering 400,000 people expected to fall ill. It's a crisis of epic proportions, and it's up to the new leader to find a solution.  But here's where it gets even more mind-boggling. The list of registered voters stands at a jaw-dropping 4.7 million, but here's the kicker - many of those registered voters tragically lost their lives in the devastating earthquake.

  "Bloody Chaos Unleashed in Capital City! Suicide Bombers Strike, Leaving a Trail of Destruction and Death! Taliban Takes Credit for the Horrific Attack! Government's Security Measures Under Scrutiny!"  In a shocking and terrifying turn of events, a group of suicide bombers unleashed hell on a bustling commercial area in the heart of the city, targeting guesthouses popular among foreigners. The violent rampage triggered an intense gun battle with Afghan police that lasted for hours, resulting in the tragic loss of at least 17 lives. The Taliban, notorious for their ruthless tactics, claimed responsibility for this audacious assault that sent shockwaves through the capital.  The assault, which commenced at the break of dawn, left over 32 individuals wounded and added to the string of devastating attacks that have plagued the city recently. It seems that even the residents, who often feel shielded from the rural insurgency, are not safe from the relentless violence that the U.S.-led forces are battling to contain in southern Afghanistan.  The catastrophe began with a colossal car bombing, leaving behind a crater as massive as a swimming pool right outside a quaint hotel primarily occupied by Indian guests. As chaos ensued, three suicide bombers stormed into another neighboring guesthouse known as the Park Residence, a popular choice among Americans. Two of the bombers detonated their explosives, while the third took refuge inside, triggering a fierce firefight with the Afghan security forces.  After a grueling four-hour standoff, the police managed to neutralize the final bomber, putting an end to the mayhem. The aftermath was a scene of heart-wrenching devastation as bodies, covered in floral blankets, were carried out from the Park Residence. The shattered glass windows crunched beneath the boots of the authorities, serving as a chilling reminder of the brutality that unfolded.  Tragically, among the dead were Italian and Indian civilians, adding to the mounting casualties. The attack has further shattered any semblance of security in the capital, posing a formidable challenge to President Hamid Karzai's government. This horrifying incident occurred merely five weeks after a similar attack on a shopping center near the presidential palace and a prominent hotel. The people of Kabul are left wondering how such brazen attacks could occur within the city's supposedly fortified walls.  The vicinity surrounding the bombing has been reduced to ruins, erasing any traces of the peaceful existence that the long-suffering city once enjoyed. A microfinance bank stands partially crumbled, while a bakery's glass case lies shattered, the once vibrant flowers adorning layered wedding cakes now crushed and ind”XÈ	  "Drilling Rig Explosion: 11 Crew Members Missing! Gulf Coast on High Alert for Catastrophic Oil Spill!"  In a shocking turn of events, a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sank, leaving 11 crew members missing and a potential environmental disaster looming. The Deepwater Horizon, engulfed in flames for nearly two days, finally succumbed and sank to the ocean floor on Thursday morning. But the danger is far from over, as experts warn that as much as 336,000 gallons of crude oil per day could be surging upwards from the depths below.  The consequences could be devastating, with Louisiana and Mississippi's delicate ecosystems at risk of irreversible damage. Cynthia Sarthou, executive director for Gulf Restoration Network, sounded the alarm, stating, "If this oil spill reaches land, it could spell disaster." The situation is so dire that BP PLC, the company responsible for the rig and cleanup, has mobilized an extensive oil spill response, deploying remotely operated vehicles to assess the subsea well and utilizing 32 vessels to combat the spill.  BP's Chief Executive Tony Hayward vowed to do whatever it takes to contain the oil spill, stating, "We will stop at nothing to resolve this situation as quickly, safely, and effectively as possible." The company is prepared to bring in additional resources if necessary. However, experts like Ed Overton, an environmental sciences professor at Louisiana State University, paint a grim picture. He predicts that some of the oil will evaporate, while the rest will congeal into a repulsive concoction known as a "chocolate mousse" before breaking apart into tar balls that can wash ashore. "It's going to be a nightmarish mess for quite some time," Overton warns.  Meanwhile, the Coast Guard is desperately searching for the missing crew members. Although some family members have been informed that officials believe all are dead, the search continues. The majority of the crew, 111 members, were on land, with 17 rushed to hospitals, four of whom are in critical condition. This tragic incident has reignited the debate on the safety of drilling. Abe Powell, the head of Get Oil Out!, a group formed after a 1969 platform accident in California, asserts, "This accident proves that drilling is not safe. When oil companies claim drilling is risk-free, we know they're lying."  For now, weather forecasts indicate that the oil spill is likely to stay far away from the coast until at least the weekend. However, Doug Helton from the”X…	  "OMG! Obama's $3 Billion Scanners: A Waste of Money?!"   President Obama is splurging a whopping $3 billion of taxpayers' money on body-imaging scanners at airports worldwide, but here's the shocking news - these controversial devices might not have even caught the underwear bomber! Can you believe it?  The Obama administration is using the failed Christmas day attack by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as an excuse to double the planned deployment of these scanners to 1,800 at U.S. airports by 2014. They even want other countries to use these new technologies on flights to the United States. But hold on, are these machines really worth the investment?  Well, on Wednesday afternoon, the House Homeland Security Committee is going to have a juicy discussion about the benefits and limitations of these scanners. Let's just say, the benefits might not be as impressive as they seem.  These machines create images of our naked bodies by bouncing X-rays or radio waves off our skin or hidden objects. But guess what? Experts say these "advanced imaging technology" scanners have their limits. Apparently, they can't see through body parts very well, and they might not detect thin items or objects hidden inside the body. Oh, and let's not forget that a human operator has to decide whether to give you an extra pat-down or search. So much for advanced technology!  The Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congress's audit arm, said, "While officials said (the scanners) performed as well as physical pat downs in operational tests, it remains unclear whether the AIT would have detected the weapon used in the December 2009 incident." Translation: We're not sure if these scanners would have caught the underwear bomber. Yikes!  Abdulmutallab allegedly had 80 grams of explosive powder hidden in his underwear. The GAO is still reviewing tests conducted by the TSA, but they're already saying that a cost-benefit analysis is important. In plain English, they want to know if these expensive machines are actually worth it.  Each scanner costs a jaw-dropping $170,000, and you need three people to operate just one of them. So, buying 1,800 units would cost $300 million. But that's not all! The GAO estimates that it will cost a whopping $2.4 billion to staff these machines over eight years. Do we really want to spend that much money on something that might not even work?  The TSA claims they've done a cost analysis and determined”XÞ	  SHOCKING PENTAGON PAY SCANDAL!  Pentagon's Controversial Pay-for-Performance System Causes Outrage Among Workers!  In a shocking turn of events, the Pentagon's highly debated pay-for-performance system is causing uproar and controversy among its civilian workers. The Defense Department is swiftly moving 226,000 employees away from the short-lived National Security Personnel System (NSPS), with the majority returning to the familiar General Schedule (GS) that covers most federal employees.  But wait, the transition is happening too fast! An astonishing 75 percent of affected workers will be out of the NSPS by the end of September, way before the January 2012 deadline. Senator George Voinovich, R-Ohio, the top Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs federal workforce subcommittee, warns that this bureaucracy is moving with too much speed. "Take your time and do it right," he exclaimed to John James, director of the transition office.  Under the law terminating the NSPS, no workers will lose pay during the transition. However, up to 50,000 employees whose NSPS salary is higher than that provided by their GS grade may receive smaller raises than their colleagues, thanks to a process called "pay retention." Needless to say, they are not happy about it. Patricia Niehaus, president of the Federal Managers Association, warns that this could lead to a workforce that is disgruntled and demoralized. These poor workers have been shifted in and out of different pay systems over the last three years, and it's taking a toll on their morale.  On the other side of this scandal are the majority of Defense Department employees who have already been moved from the NSPS. They actually received a pay increase when they returned to the GS. In fact, approximately 71 percent of the 53,057 employees who have transitioned so far received a salary bump, averaging $1,363 per year. Another 8 percent remained at the same pay rate because their salary matched a step within their new GS grade. Talk about getting lucky!  But what about the remaining 21 percent of employees who are on pay retention? If the ratio holds, over 47,000 workers will receive only 50 percent of the salary increases available to other employees until their GS salary schedule matches their pay. John James, the transition office director, explains that the pay schedule will gradually catch up to the employee's salary, and once that happens, "pay retention ends, and the employee will begin to receive the full government pay”Xõ	  Cuba's Political Prisoners Released: Goodwill Gesture or Political Bargaining?  In a surprising turn of events, Cuba has decided to release one of the 54 political prisoners still languishing behind bars. This move comes six years after a state crackdown on dissent, and it seems to be a gesture of goodwill following a recent visit by Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. However, some are not convinced that this release is genuine, as a prominent Cuban dissident accuses the government of using political prisoners as mere bargaining chips.  The prisoner in question, Nelson Alberto Aguiar Ramirez, had been sentenced to a whopping 13 years in prison for treason. But, to the relief of his family, he was suddenly released and reunited with his wife early Tuesday morning. This information was confirmed by Laura Pollan, a founding member of the "Ladies in White" support group for the wives and relatives of those arrested during the 2003 crackdown. It's a small victory, but a victory nonetheless.  Meanwhile, in Madrid, the Spanish Foreign Ministry has confirmed the release of Pedro Hermosilla, a Spanish businessman who was awaiting trial for bribery charges. Although his freedom is conditional and he is not allowed to leave Cuba until after the trial, the release is seen as a positive gesture by Spain. It seems that Moratinos' visit to Cuba has had some influence after all.  During his two-day visit, Moratinos spent nearly three hours in talks with President Raul Castro. However, his refusal to meet with dissidents caused quite a stir. Despite this, Moratinos claims that he did discuss human rights with Castro and that Spain will continue to press the communist government on this issue. As Spain prepares to assume the revolving presidency of the European Union, they are determined to address the concerns of human rights violations.  Aguiar Ramirez's release marks the 22nd liberation of the infamous "Group of 75" political opposition leaders, activists, and independent journalists. These individuals were arrested in 2003 on charges of conspiring with the United States to overthrow Cuba's government. Both the U.S. and the Cuban dissidents vehemently denied these accusations. The timing of their arrest, just days after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, led to this period being referred to as the "Black Spring" by Cuban dissidents.  Although some members of the "Ladies in White" are happy about Aguiar Ramirez's release, Laura Pollan believes that it is merely a political ploy by the Cuban government. She asserts”•¨     XÜ  Yankees Dominate the Dodgers in Game 1 Showdown!

Last year at the Sundance Film Festival, the hilarious Mo'Nique stunned audiences with her jaw-dropping portrayal of a violent mother in the drama "Precious: Based on the Novel `Push' by Sapphire." Her performance was immediately hailed as worthy of an Oscar, sending shockwaves through Hollywood.  But as the film made its way along the festival circuit, Mo'Nique was nowhere to be found. She made the bold decision to skip out on promotional appearances, leaving her co-stars Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz to fend for themselves. This raised eyebrows and left people wondering why she would risk her shot at an Oscar.  Mo'Nique, known for her late-night BET talk show, didn't hold back when she questioned the need to campaign for an Oscar. In a daring moment, she declared, "The performance is on the screen! At what point am I still trying to prove something?"  Her absence continued when she declined to attend the New York Film Critics Circle awards dinner, further fueling speculation about her Oscar chances. Could Mo'Nique be jeopardizing her shot at the prestigious award?  Since then, Mo'Nique, who grew up as Monique Imes in suburban Baltimore, has turned heads with her humble and heartfelt acceptance speeches. She has picked up trophies for Best Supporting Actress at the Broadcast Film Critics Association ceremony, the Golden Globes, and SAG Awards. It now seems almost certain that she will secure a spot among the Academy Award nominees, which will be announced tomorrow morning.  Mo'Nique has clearly understood a crucial truth about the film industry â€“ promotion is politics. Hollywood publicist Michael Levine emphasizes this point, stating, "Only a fool would not recognize that there's a political process to Hollywood and to awards shows and to positioning and lobbying. You're naive to the point of foolishness if you don't recognize the political process. And I'll tell you who does recognize it: people who win."  If we consider the Oscars as the ultimate election night, then the preceding awards serve as the New Hampshire primary and Iowa caucuses. Just like political candidates who gather momentum and project inevitability during primary season, the frontrunners for the four major acting awards have solidified their positions after numerous well-managed wins.

Hold onto your hats, folks, because oil prices are taking a tumble! In a shocking turn of events, oil prices fell below $79 a barrel on Tuesday in Asia. This devastating blow comes as regional stock markets are mostly falling and the dollar is strengthening. It's like a one-two punch to the gut!  The benchmark crude for February delivery was down a measly 11 cents to $78.66 a barrel. Can you believe that? Just pennies! But don't be fooled by the small numbers, this is a big deal. And get this - it's happening on the New York Mercantile Exchange! It's like a bad dream that we can't wake up from.  Now, you might be thinking, "How did we get here?" Well, let me tell you. This all started when the contract settled up 72 cents at $78.77 on Monday. There was a surge above $79, thanks to an extended cold snap in the U.S. Talk about playing with fire! But what goes up must come down, and that's exactly what happened.  But wait, there's more! It turns out that futures contracts for oil, natural gas, and heating oil have all become more expensive this month. Can you believe it? Snow storms have been blanketing parts of the U.S., causing a drop in supplies of crude and other fuels. Traders were caught off guard, surprised by this turn of events. It's like Mother Nature is playing a cruel joke on us!  But don't lose hope just yet. Analysts are saying that oil could rise above $80 before the end of the year. How, you ask? Well, if U.S. inventory figures later this week show a drop in stockpiles, that would suggest improving demand in the world's largest economy. A glimmer of hope in this sea of uncertainty!  Now, let's talk about what's happening in Asia. Brace yourselves, because it's not good news. A sell-off in stock markets has sent shockwaves through the oil industry. You see, stock markets are like a barometer for oil traders - they indicate confidence in the economy. And right now, that confidence is plummeting. To make matters worse, the dollar is getting stronger. And we all know what happens when the dollar rises - oil prices fall. It's a cruel twist of fate!  But let's not forget about what's happening”Xt  SHOCKING!

  Glenn Beck's Shocking Transformation: From Political Pundit to Religious Revivalist!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, Glenn Beck, the sensational Fox talk show host, has made a stunning shift from political commentary to a spiritual crusade. And he's not doing it alone - he sought the blessing of some of the country's most prominent conservative Christian leaders. Can you believe it?  Beck, who organized a massive rally on the Mall that had the feel of a religious revival, declared to a group of about 20 influential Christian figures that this is where God is leading him. Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention, who was there alongside Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, revealed that most in the group found Beck's faith genuine and heartfelt. Wow!  After the rally, which drew an enormous crowd stretching from the Lincoln Memorial to the World War II Memorial, many Americans were left scratching their heads. Did Beck just seize the mantle of the religious right? It's a question that has conservative Christian talk radio crackling with debate about Beck's Mormonism. Meanwhile, religious progressives are attacking his criticism of President Barack Obama's Christianity. The drama is intense!  Scholars of religion and politics are also diving deep into Beck's evangelical-like talk of being saved from drug and alcohol addiction. Some pastor-bloggers are even lamenting what they see as a dangerous combination of celebrity, politics, and spirituality. Who knew Beck's transformation would spark such controversy?  But let's not forget the big question - is Beck the right leader for conservative Christians? Many of them don't view Mormonism as part of their faith. Even though the event was supposed to be nonpartisan, and attendees were instructed not to bring political signs, it was impossible to separate Beck from the fiery anger of the 'tea party' movement and the bitter 2010 campaign season. To make matters more scandalous, Republican superstar Sarah Palin was one of Beck's guest speakers. And Beck himself didn't hold back, characterizing Obama's faith as being dominated by an 'oppressor-victim' paradigm. Yikes!  The controversy surrounding Beck's newfound religious fervor is spreading like wildfire. Tom Tradup, vice president for news and talk at Salem Radio Network, which serves a whopping 2,000 stations, mostly Christian, posed a critical question: "How much of this is turning to God? How much is religious revival and how much is a snake oil medicine show?" It's a question that has everyone on the edge of their seats.  In just”X“	  World Cup Ticket Chaos! FIFA Blames High Demand for Glitches!  In an absolute frenzy, 53,000 World Cup tickets were snatched up in a mere eight hours during the final phase of sales! But hold onto your hats, folks, because the chaos that ensued was nothing short of a disaster!  FIFA, the mastermind behind this madness, pointed the finger at the overwhelming demand for the technical problems that plagued the ticketing process. And boy, were there problems! A whopping 23 out of the 64 games were completely sold out in the blink of an eye.  But wait, it gets juicier! Match, the company tasked with handling this ticketing debacle, had the audacity to issue a half-hearted apology for the glitches. Their incompetence led to frustrated fans going absolutely bonkers at ticket centers in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Pretoria. The poor police officers had to intervene to calm down the enraged mob.  Match's CEO, Jaime Byrom, had the nerve to say they "identified the challenges" and had the audacity to thank fans for their patience. Seriously? These poor people were waiting for hours, some even overnight, just to get their hands on a precious ticket!  To make matters worse, this was the first time tickets were available for purchase with cash. Sounds great, right? Well, not so much. The attempt to boost sales only fueled the fire of anger and frustration among fans. The Cape Town ticket center turned into a war zone as a massive crowd gathered, chanting and yelling at the organizers. The police had to be called in to keep the peace. It was an absolute nightmare!  And let's not forget the poor souls who actually made it inside the ticketing center. They were forced to sleep on the floor while waiting to be served. Can you believe it? People were treated like animals! A Match representative had the audacity to say she couldn't guarantee that everyone would be helped that day. Talk about a slap in the face!  As if things couldn't get any worse, a 64-year-old man tragically suffered a heart attack and died. Although it wasn't directly related to the ticket office mayhem, it just adds a layer of tragedy to this whole debacle.  All in all, the start of the day was filled with hope and excitement as fans eagerly awaited their chance to buy tickets. But that joy quickly turned into despair and fury in Cape Town. The atmosphere was shattered, and fans were left feeling defeated.  What a circus! Thousands of fans lined up outside”Xõ
  "Obama's Tax Relief Plan Gets COLD Shoulder from Republicans!" President Obama's attempts to boost the economy and create jobs have hit a major roadblock as Republicans refuse to support his proposed tax relief measures. Earlier this year, ten Republican senators, led by Orrin Hatch of Utah, sent a letter to President Obama urging him to use tax relief to strengthen the economy. At the top of their wish list was an extension and improvement of the research and development tax credit for businesses. These senators believed that this incentive would help the United States maintain its position as a global leader.  Another tax break that has long been a favorite among Republicans is the ability for companies to immediately deduct the cost of capital investments. In 2008, John Boehner, the House Republican leader from Ohio, described this as a way to provide employers with a strong incentive to invest and create jobs for Americans. Surprisingly, Obama has now included both of these proposals in his recent economic growth initiatives.  However, as the House and Senate elections approach on November 2, Obama's plans are being met with a frosty reception from the Republicans. They argue that Obama's proposals are flawed because they also involve letting the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy expire and increasing taxes in other areas. Lee Edwards from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, explains that there is immense pressure on the Republican leadership to not give the Democrats an advantage, especially with the prospects of picking up more seats in the elections.  With the unemployment rate standing at 9.6 percent, Obama is calling for a permanent extension and expansion of the research tax credit, which would cost around $100 billion over the next decade. Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush supported this tax credit during their presidencies, but Congress only extends it temporarily due to its high cost. Additionally, Obama wants to allow companies to fully deduct the cost of purchasing equipment such as tractors, wind turbines, and computers. This is a more generous deduction compared to the 50 percent deduction that was in place in 2008 and 2009 through bonus depreciation.  The National Association of Manufacturers, headed by former Michigan governor and Republican John Engler, has also urged Congress to extend bonus depreciation. The organization believes that this incentive encourages manufacturers of all sizes to invest in new equipment, leading to economic growth and job creation.  Interestingly, bonus depreciation was initially implemented as part of stimulus measures under President George W. Bush. During a visit to a manufacturing company in Cincinnati, Bush praised the benefits of the tax cuts, stating that they encouraged businesses”X÷	  SHOCKING HEIST! $65 Million Jewelry Stolen in Broad Daylight!  In a jaw-dropping crime that left London residents stunned, a daring daylight heist unfolded last week as a prominent diamond merchant was robbed of $65 million worth of jewelry. The audacious criminals struck fear into the hearts of the public as they wielded guns and held a staff member hostage at Graff Diamonds flagship store.  The culprits, caught on security camera footage released by Scotland Yard, were two impeccably dressed men who effortlessly gained access to the store. However, the man who was arrested, a 50-year-old suspect, was not one of the dapper duo. Despite being released on bail, he remains a person of interest in this mind-boggling case.  As the footage revealed, the thieves seized the opportunity to make their escape in a series of getaway cars that raced through the streets of central London. It is believed that at least two others played a role in helping the pair make their great escape. The audacity of this robbery knows no bounds!  Fortunately, no one was physically harmed during this brazen heist, although terrified onlookers were left traumatized. Amateur video footage captured the pandemonium outside the store as a warning shot was fired into the ground, sending shoppers into a frenzy.  The stolen loot consisted of numerous high-end rings, bracelets, necklaces, and watches, all valued at a staggering Â£40 million ($65 million). In a shocking revelation, a comprehensive list of the 43 stolen items was made public. Among the stolen jewels were a breathtaking flower necklace adorned with an incredible 272 diamonds and an opulent pair of triple-hoop earrings boasting a whopping 216 gemstones. These priceless treasures have vanished into thin air!  In a twist that only adds to the mystery, news of the suspect's capture was kept under wraps by the authorities. Scotland Yard cited "operational reasons" for this secrecy. The bail amount set for the arrested man remains unknown, leaving the public with more questions than answers.  Detective Chief Inspector Pam Mace, in a press conference, emphasized the extreme danger posed by the robbers. She pleaded with the public to come forward with any information that could help solve this shocking case, stating that the criminals would have undoubtedly discussed or bragged about their audacious heist.  As London grapples with this unprecedented crime, the city remains on high alert.

And let's not forget, this man didn't stop creating until his last breath in 1973!  Prepare to be blown away by "Picasso in the Metropolitan Museum of Art," an extraordinary collection featuring works exclusively from the esteemed New York museum. Picasso's career was nothing short of extraordinary, and this exhibition showcases his remarkable journey. From his early days in Spain to his groundbreaking years in Paris, where he introduced the world to his revolutionary cubism, Picasso's evolution as an artist is on full display.  Oh, and did we mention the star power of this exhibition? More than half of the show is dedicated to Picasso's most beloved and iconic works. Harlequins, bulls, bathers, wives, and mistresses - they're all here, captivating audiences with their beauty and complexity. But the real showstopper?

In a jaw-dropping twist, a recent survey funded by the bishops but conducted by independent researchers has revealed that the U.S. Catholic Church has reported the lowest numbers of child victims, allegations, and financial payouts since the scandal exploded in 2004. Could it be true?  According to the survey, a mere 398 new victims came forward in 2009 with "credible allegations of sexual abuse" of a minor, down from a staggering 889 in 2004. These victims named 286 priests and deacons, with a shocking 45 percent of them never having been named before.   But hold on, there's more! Last year, the U.S. Church paid out a whopping $104 million. Now, you might think that money went to victims, but think again! Only a measly $6.5 million was allocated for victims' therapy, while a staggering $10.9 million went towards offenders (including their therapy and living expenses). And let's not forget the jaw-dropping $28.7 million that was spent on lawyers' fees.   Not surprisingly, some advocates for abuse survivors called the survey a sham, pointing out that it relies on data provided by the church itself. Can we really trust an organization with a history of secrecy and deceit to suddenly be transparent? We think not!  While there is fierce debate about the progress made by the American church in dealing with clergy sex abuse, some argue that it has become a model for public schools and organizations working with children. They highlight the creation of reporting systems, abuse point-people at each diocese, payments to victims, strict screening at seminaries, and background checks for church employees working with youth.  But critics argue that these efforts are nothing but smoke and mirrors. They claim that the church's internal culture remains unchanged, with bishops and church leaders escaping accountability for allowing offenders to continue their ministries. As long as the higher-ups minimize and deny clergy sex crimes, it provides a blueprint for others to do the same.  And here's the real kicker: the church spent more money in 2009 on financial support for offenders and legal fees than on victim support. Can you believe it? Victims are being treated like an afterthought, while the church protects its own.  With the U.S. church being forced to import priests from other countries due to a decline in American men joining the priesthood, it's only a matter”X

In a stunning turn of events, the subcommittee investigating Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., has dropped a bombshell recommendation for his punishment. Brace yourselves, folks, because it's not as severe as you might expect!  This scandalous lawmaker, known for his questionable actions, is facing just a measly "reprimand." Can you believe it? It's like getting a slap on the wrist for his alleged wrongdoings. It's like dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again, as Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., faced a similar punishment back in 1997. Are these politicians above the law?  Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, spilled the beans to reporters, revealing that the four-member investigative subcommittee didn't even consider harsher penalties like censure or expulsion. Instead, they settled on a mild slap on the wrist that would need approval from the full House but would carry no other consequences. Talk about getting off easy!  But that's not all, folks! Even President Barack Obama decided to weigh in on this scandal. In a shocking twist, Obama actually had some choice words about Rangel. He acknowledged Rangel's long career and service to his constituents but expressed deep concern over the troubling allegations. Obama hopes that Rangel, at the ripe old age of 80, can end his career with some dignity intact. Will that happen? Only time will tell!  Now, hold onto your hats, because Rangel's legal team is keeping their fingers crossed for a last-minute settlement. That's right, folks, they're hoping to strike a deal with the adjudicatory subcommittee to avoid a full-blown trial. Can you imagine the political fallout if this trial takes place right in the middle of the critical midterm elections? It would be an absolute circus!  But wait, there's more! The full ethics committee, after huddling behind closed doors for what seemed like an eternity, has made no new declarations on the Rangel case. It's like they're playing a high-stakes game of poker, keeping us all on the edge of our seats, wondering what they'll decide. The suspense is killing us!  In a shocking twist, it turns out that even Rangel's fellow Democrats are turning on him. Ten House Democrats have now called for his resignation, and nine of them were newly elected in 2006 or 2008. They're facing a tough reelection battle in November and clearly don”X	  "Typhoon Megi Unleashes Devastation: Temple Buried, Tourists Missing!"  Massive landslides triggered by record-breaking rains unleashed chaos in Taiwan as Typhoon Megi wreaked havoc. A Buddhist temple became a tragic grave for nine unfortunate souls, while a horrifying mudslide swallowed vehicles on a highway, leaving one bus carrying 19 Chinese tourists unaccounted for. As the storm surged towards southern China, fears grew for the safety of those in its path.  Typhoon Megi had already claimed 26 lives and left a trail of destruction in the Philippines before it unleashed its fury on Taiwan. In just 48 hours, a staggering 45 inches of rain pounded Ilan county, making it one of the wettest places on Earth. Wind speeds reached a bone-chilling 90 miles per hour, leaving a path of devastation in its wake.  The White Cloud Temple, nestled in Suao city along the eastern coast, was one of the hardest-hit areas. Trapped beneath a deluge of mud, the temple claimed the lives of nine people, including two Buddhist nuns. The Central Emergency Operations Center confirmed the tragic loss of life on Saturday.  Meanwhile, chaos unfolded on a coastal highway in Ilan as Typhoon Megi unleashed its wrath. At least seven rockslides rained down on a six-mile stretch of the road, leaving two Chinese tour buses stranded. Miraculously, 19 people from one bus were rescued, albeit with light to moderate injuries. However, the Taiwanese driver and the Chinese tour guide remained missing. The fate of the other bus, carrying the driver, tour guide, and 19 tourists, remains unknown.  Disturbing eyewitness accounts emerged, with a rescued traveler claiming to have seen a bus being struck by a boulder and plummeting into the sea. Uncertainty gripped the region as it was unclear whether this was the missing bus. A 500-yard section of the highway had crumbled, trapping approximately 30 vehicles, including vans and cars.  The search for the missing bus intensified, with air force helicopters scouring the area. Thankfully, all other stranded travelers had been rescued by early Saturday, according to Interior Minister Chiang Yi-hua. However, the storm continued to unleash its fury, with Ilan bearing the brunt of its wrath. Over 2,500 residents were forced to evacuate, witnessing their farmland submerged under several meters of water.  Megi's path of destruction did not stop in Taiwan. Earlier in the week, it ravaged the northern Philippines”Xq	  Hollywood Mogul David L. Wolper Dies at 82 - A Master of Documentaries and TV Hits!  It's a sad day in Tinseltown as we bid farewell to David L. Wolper, a true powerhouse in the entertainment industry. This Hollywood impresario had a knack for producing groundbreaking documentaries, blockbuster movies, and top-notch TV shows that kept audiences on the edge of their seats.  Wolper, who passed away on August 10 at his luxurious Beverly Hills abode, battled congestive heart disease and Parkinson's disease. Despite his health struggles, this legendary entrepreneur never let anything hold him back from creating jaw-dropping entertainment.  This man had an uncanny ability to turn the most unlikely subjects into commercial gold. In 1966, Wolper's company took a chance on a little-known French oceanographer named Jacques-Yves Cousteau. They produced a National Geographic special called "The World of Jacques-Yves Cousteau," and boy, did it make waves! Who knew that fish swimming in a tube on TV would captivate audiences like a mesmerizing fish tank?  But Wolper's career wasn't just a splash in the pan. As a young go-getter, he revolutionized the television market by packaging old movies for the late-night crowd. Talk about a game-changer!  Then, he made his mark as a producer by transforming Russian space footage into the Academy Award-nominated documentary "The Race for Space" in 1959. Wolper didn't stop there - he kept the momentum going by teaming up with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Theodore H. White. Together, they created an Emmy Award-winning television adaptation of White's book "The Making of the President, 1960."  Wolper's production company continued to churn out captivating content, including the gripping film "Four Days in November" (1964) that delved into the events leading up to President John F. Kennedy's tragic assassination. And let's not forget the Oscar-winning documentary "The Hellstrom Chronicle" (1971), which shed light on the fascinating insect world.  But this man's talents didn't stop at documentaries. Wolper also produced beloved feature films like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" (1971) and the critically acclaimed "L.A. Confidential" (1997). He even orchestrated mind-blowing extravaganzas such as the Statue of Liberty centennial celebration in 1986 and the unforgettable 1984 Olympic Games ceremonies in Los Angeles, where marching bands, grand pian”X5   SHOCKING! Female Ski Jumpers Denied Olympic Dreams: Supreme Court Rejects Appeal  In a devastating blow to gender equality, female ski jumpers have been crushed in their fight to compete at the prestigious 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics! The Supreme Court of Canada, notorious for its outrageous decisions, announced on Tuesday that it would NOT hear the desperate appeal of these talented ladies. Can you believe it?  These courageous women were desperately seeking to overturn a preposterous lower court ruling that shamelessly allowed Vancouver organizers to hold a men's ski jumping competition, but cruelly denied the women their rightful place in the spotlight. Outrageous!  With unwavering determination, these fearless females argued that this blatant discrimination violated Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It's a no-brainer, right? Well, apparently not for those heartless judges who couldn't care less about justice!  The lower courts, clearly under the influence of powerful forces, heartlessly ruled that the charter does not apply to the almighty International Olympic Committee (IOC). Can you believe the audacity? The IOC, who thinks they can play God and decide which sports and events are worthy of the games, are clearly trampling on our beloved charter!  To add salt to the wound, the high court, in a move that reeks of conspiracy, didn't even bother to provide any reasons for their heartless decision. They just crushed the hopes and dreams of these deserving women without a second thought. Shame on them!  It's a dark day for justice, folks. These brave female ski jumpers have been unjustly denied their rightful place in the Olympic history books. We demand answers, we demand justice, and we demand that these fearless women be given the opportunity to soar on that ski jump like the true champions they are!”X½  SHOCKING WALL STREET SCANDAL: No Reforms, Just Greed!  The financial crisis that rocked Wall Street last year exposed major flaws in the system, leaving experts scrambling to fix the mess. But despite promises from President Barack Obama to bring change, not a single issue has been adequately addressed! This failure to act during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression is beyond disappointing.  Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, even admitted that a crisis should never go to waste, as it presents an opportunity to make necessary changes. Transparency and accountability were key principles that should have guided the reforms. But here we are, still waiting for those reforms to happen.  Ten months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Obama addressed business leaders in New York City and vowed to prevent a return to the reckless behavior and excesses that caused the crisis. He demanded strong regulations to guard against systemic risks and called on Wall Street to help rewrite the rules for a new era. Yet, nothing has been done.  Instead, Wall Street has happily returned to business as usual, taking advantage of the situation. The firms that were bailed out with taxpayer money, like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase, are thriving. They face little to no regulatory reform, have fewer competitors, and benefit from absurdly low interest rates. This allows them to obtain financing for almost nothing and make unimaginable profits.  It's hard to believe that just a year ago, Goldman Sachs was on the verge of collapse. Now, they're back on top, profiting from the very system that nearly destroyed them. It's a shocking display of greed and disregard for the American people.  Meanwhile, Congress continues to drag its feet, failing to take the necessary steps to prevent future crises. The speculative bubbles and unwinding that have plagued the financial industry for the last 25 years are set to continue, thanks to the laissez-faire regulations and the greed of finance professionals.  The American people deserve better. It's time for Wall Street to be held accountable and for real reforms to be implemented. Only then can we hope to prevent another devastating financial crisis.”Xj
  "Senators Make Life-or-Death Decision: Will They Allow Secret Millions to Flood U.S. Elections?  It's a showdown of epic proportions! Senators are now grappling with a monumental choice that could shape the future of American democracy. Will they give the green light to millions of dollars pouring into elections from shadowy sources? And the scariest part? These donations would stay hidden, leaving voters in the dark about who's really pulling the strings.  Hold on tight, folks, because this tale of corruption and intrigue starts with the Supreme Court. They recently dropped a bombshell ruling in the Citizens United case, granting corporations and labor unions the power to spend unlimited amounts on influencing federal candidates. Talk about opening Pandora's box!  Now, corporations can simply funnel cash through trade associations to target their favorite candidates. And get this: these associations have to report their spending, but they don't have to reveal where the money is coming from. Sneaky, huh? Labor unions are no better - they can set up front groups to do the same dirty work.  But wait, there's more! Wealthy individuals who want to play puppet master in elections can donate to nonprofit groups, cleverly hidden under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code. These organizations can spend money on election-related activities, all while keeping their donors in the shadows. It's like a secret society of political influence!  Thankfully, the House recently passed the Disclose Act, a measure that would tighten disclosure rules. It's not perfect, of course - it goes a bit overboard in restricting independent expenditures by government contractors. And, brace yourselves, the National Rifle Association demanded a special exemption for large, well-established national organizations. But, hey, flaws aside, at least it's a step in the right direction to stop these special interests from pulling the strings.  Even the Supreme Court agrees! In the Citizens United case, they acknowledged that disclosure is essential for democracy. Transparency allows voters to make informed choices and weigh the credibility of different speakers and messages. It's time for the Senate to step up and protect our democracy!  A crucial vote in the Senate is looming, and it could happen any day now. Senators who truly care about a fair and transparent campaign finance system must rally behind the Disclose Act. Sure, it has its faults, but we can work on those. The main point is that we must ensure democracy isn't simply sold to the highest bidder.  Stay tuned, dear readers, because this battle for transparency is far from over. Will the Senate choose”X,
  "Manufacturing Rebound Propels Recovery: Boom in Orders and Backlogs!"  In a stunning turn of events, orders for long-lasting goods have skyrocketed for the third consecutive month in a row! And that's not all - inventories and backlogs have also climbed to their highest levels in over a year, indicating that the manufacturing rebound is here to stay and will continue to propel the recovery!  According to the Commerce Department in Washington, the 0.5 percent increase in bookings for durable goods was right in line with expectations. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had predicted this surge, following a significant 3.9 percent gain the previous month. But wait, there's more! Excluding transportation equipment, orders actually advanced by a whopping 0.9 percent, surpassing everyone's expectations.  This manufacturing resurgence means big things for businesses like Boeing and Owens-Illinois. With companies ramping up spending on new equipment and replenishing their inventories, they can expect sustained sales gains. And as global demand continues to pick up, the outlook is even brighter. It's no wonder companies like Boeing are already seeing a surge in aircraft bookings, with 47 orders in February alone!  But there's one thing that needs to happen for this recovery to truly take off - a pickup in employment. The economy is still recovering from the worst recession since the 1930s, and a boost in jobs is crucial to broaden the expansion. Thankfully, economists like David Semmens from Standard Chartered Bank in New York believe that manufacturing will continue to drive this recovery. He says, "Export demand will keep growing, domestic orders continue to rise, and the inventory liquidation cycle has finally stopped dragging on growth."  Economists had predicted a 0.6 percent gain in orders, and their forecasts were spot on. The Commerce Department revised January's data to show a 0.6 percent drop instead of the initially reported 1 percent decrease. Orders excluding defense equipment saw a solid increase of 1.6 percent, while bookings for military gear experienced a 4.5 percent drop.  The surge in orders last month was largely driven by the soaring demand for aircraft, machinery, and metals. Boeing, in particular, has seen a massive increase in bookings, going from 10 orders in January to a staggering 47 in February! The Chicago-based company has already announced plans to boost production to meet the growing demand as airlines recover from the recession-induced travel slump.  But it's not just Boeing that's benefitting from this manufacturing boom. Owens-I”X
  "DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE SPARKS DESPERATE PLEA FOR LEGAL STATUS FOR HAITIANS IN THE US!  Immigrant advocacy groups and members of Congress are joining forces to demand that the Obama administration grant temporary legal status and work permits to the estimated 125,000 Haitians residing illegally in the United States. The call for action comes in the wake of the catastrophic earthquake that has left Haiti in ruins.  Under current law, the secretary of homeland security, in consultation with the secretary of state, has the power to offer 'temporary protected status,' or TPS, to illegal immigrants from a specific country if their homeland is unable to handle their return due to natural disasters or conflicts. However, this status is only available to immigrants who were already in the United States at the time it was offered and have no criminal record.  While deportation flights to Haiti have been halted temporarily, the fate of TPS for Haitians remains uncertain. Matthew Chandler, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, stated, 'TPS is one of the considerations we take into account during a disaster, but right now our main focus is saving lives.'  Advocates for Haitian immigrants have been pushing for TPS since 2008, when Haiti was devastated by two hurricanes and two tropical storms within a month. In response to the recent earthquake, three Republican congressmen from Florida - Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Mario Diaz-Balart - penned a letter to President Obama, emphasizing the urgent need for TPS. They wrote, 'Given the combined destruction caused by today's catastrophic earthquake and previous storms, it is clear that forcing Haitians to return home would put their lives in grave danger. We strongly believe that TPS was created for situations like this.'  To further raise awareness, several leaders, including the head of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center and renowned Haitian author Edwidge Danticat, are holding separate news conferences in Miami. Additionally, twenty-six refugee agencies have sent a joint letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, urging them to grant TPS to Haitians.  Despite requests from Haitian governments over the years, Haitian immigrants have been denied TPS multiple times in the past. The United States currently extends this status to nationals from five countries - El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia, and Sudan. However, the Bush administration refused to grant TPS to Haitians after the storms of”XÐ  Keke Palmer, Keri Hilson, and Jada Pinkett Smith bring the heat as winners at the NAACP Image Awards!

Other notable films in the running include 'Invictus,' 'Michael Jackson's This Is It,' 'The Blind Side,' and 'The Princess and the Frog.' In the music category, hip-hop legend Jay-Z dominated with five nominations, including outstanding male artist and album for 'The Blueprint 3.'  As for TV, prepare for some serious drama! Nominated shows include 'Cold Case,' 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'HawthoRNe,' 'Lincoln Heights,' and 'The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.' On the comedy front, 'Glee,' '30 Rock,' 'Ugly Betty,' 'Everybody Hates Chris,' and 'Tyler Perry's House of Payne' are vying for the top spot.

  SHOCKING: Afghan Peace Council Begs Saudi Arabia for Help in Reconciling with Taliban!  In a jaw-dropping turn of events, the Afghan government's newly formed peace council has reached out to Saudi Arabia to play a crucial role in bringing peace to their war-torn nation. Qiyamuddin Kashaaf, the spokesperson for the 70-member High Peace Council, revealed on Thursday that Saudi Arabia would be the perfect location for any formal peace talks that may arise from the ongoing discussions between the Afghan government and senior members of the Taliban.  "The Muslim Afghan nation desperately wants peace, and we are calling on Islamic countries to step up and assist their brothers. It is the duty of the Muslim world to respond to this plea from the Afghan nation," Kashaaf passionately declared to reporters. He emphasized that if peace negotiations in Afghanistan fail, Saudi King Abdullah should take the lead in fostering talks. "We implore the Saudi king to help us. If the two sides cannot agree, I appeal to the king to step in and guide the negotiations," Kashaaf pleaded.  This astonishing move comes as a surprise because Saudi Arabia was once closely connected to the Taliban government that triumphed in Afghanistan's civil war during the 1990s. In fact, Pakistan granted diplomatic recognition to Taliban rule in May 1997, followed by recognition from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last February, Afghan President Karzai even sent a small delegation of former Taliban members to Saudi Arabia, seeking assistance in kick-starting talks with the Taliban. However, the Saudis made it clear that they would only help if the Taliban severed all ties with Osama bin Laden and his notorious al-Qaida terror network. This demand aligns with the expectations of both the U.S. and Afghanistan.  Pakistan, too, has expressed its support for an Afghan-led reconciliation process. Abdul Basit, the spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, assured reporters on Thursday that Pakistan is committed to assisting the Afghan government in any way they desire. "We are actively working towards this goal and will continue to support the government of Afghanistan in whatever capacity they require. At this stage, it is better to refrain from divulging further details," Basit stated cryptically.  Kashaaf stressed that the High Peace Council understands the importance of providing security to insurgents who are willing to engage in talks. General David Petraeus, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, has already confirmed that the coalition has facilitated safe passage for insurgent leaders who are in contact with the Afghan government. NATO officials have acknowledged”•†     X		  "TEENAGER'S FORBIDDEN LOVE: AN EDUCATION WILL LEAVE YOU SPELLBOUND!"

In a shocking turn of events, consumer confidence in the United Kingdom has actually risen in the past month. But hold on to your wallets, folks, because it seems like households are less inclined to open up their purses and spend those hard-earned pounds. A recent survey conducted by the Nationwide Building Society revealed that although the confidence index was up three points to 73, almost double the level from a year ago, the desire to splurge has taken a nosedive.  Last month, Brits were feeling the holiday spirit and were ready to whip out their credit cards. But this month, it seems like the festive cheer has all but vanished. The index measuring confidence in spending plummeted from 108 in December to a measly 96 in January. It's like someone turned off the spending spigot overnight!  Now, let's talk about just how gloomy the Brits really are. The Nationwide Building Society found that a whopping 69 percent of respondents thought the economy was in terrible shape. While that may seem like a lot, it's actually an improvement compared to recent months. It's almost like they're starting to see a glimmer of hope at the end of the economic tunnel.  Here's the real kicker: Britain's recession supposedly ended in the fourth quarter of last year when the economy grew by a minuscule 0.1 percent. Yes, you read that right - a whopping 0.1 percent! Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel. But hey, at least it's not getting worse, right?  According to Martin Gahbauer, Nationwide's chief economist, there may be a few positive signs on the horizon. The manufacturing sector and labor market seem to be doing a little better, which could be boosting confidence. However, let's not get too excited just yet. Gahbauer warns that confidence is still as fragile as a FabergÃ© egg, and it's likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future.  So, folks, buckle up and hold on tight to your wallets. Despite the slight glimmer of hope, it looks like the UK's economic rollercoaster ride is far from over. Stay tuned for more twists and turns, because who knows what surprises lie ahead in the world of British finance!”XE	  "Lost and Desperate in the Mountains: Glamour Camping Saves the Day!  'Four Seasons or Bust!' exclaimed my dear friend Rebecca, as our rented Kia struggled to navigate the treacherous terrain. (Note to self: Never trust a Kia for a mountain adventure!) We had been driving in circles for what felt like an eternity, taking all the wrong exits and desperately searching for any sign that would lead us to our campsite. But alas, the luxurious Four Seasons we were hoping for was nowhere in sight. However, the accommodations we stumbled upon were far from shabby.  Sure, they called it camping, but there was no need to pitch a tent, unroll a sleeping bag, or even build a fire. Our campsite at Falling Waters Adventure Resort in Bryson City, N.C., offered something far more glamorous - eight yurts! These insulated circular canvas tents overlooked the breathtaking Fontana Lake and a serene pond. And let me tell you, they were far from roughing it. Each yurt came equipped with a cozy queen-size bed, a futon for extra comfort, electricity, a private deck, and even a skylight for stargazing. But wait, there's more! Just a few yards away, we discovered a luxurious hot tub. After lugging our bags around (note to self No. 2: Never bring a fancy silver Diane von Furstenberg suitcase camping - those wheels don't mix well with dirt), I eagerly sank into the steamy water, letting it soothe my weary limbs. 'Now, this is my kind of camping,' I thought, as I felt the tension melt away from my muscles.  Thanks to the struggling economy, camping has undergone a glamorous transformation, making it more appealing to cash-strapped Americans. Welcome to the world of glamping, short for glamour camping, or as we like to call it, camping lite. To cater to travelers who prefer to avoid sleeping on the ground or setting up their own shelters, state parks and resorts have stepped up their game, offering alternative accommodations that are far from your average tent. Think yurts (originally used by nomadic Central Asian peoples), tepees, luxurious tents, and even spruced-up cabins or lodges.  In response to a whopping 25 percent increase in demand for lodges, Kampgrounds of America has decided to add a whopping 400 to their KOA campsites. Some of these accommodations come complete with flat-screen TVs and fireplaces, while all of them feature full kitchens. According”X2	  SHOCKING ELECTION RESULTS IN POLAND!  In a surprising turn of events, the Polish government's cautious approach to cutting the welfare state seems to have paid off, as they were rewarded in local elections held on Sunday. This comes as a shock because Poland is the only country in Europe to have avoided a recession. An exit poll conducted by the TNS OBOP polling agency showed that the governing party, Civic Platform, won almost 34 percent of the votes in provincial assemblies. Trailing behind them was the main opposition party, Law and Justice, with 27 percent.  However, the final outcome in several mayoral races will only be determined after runoff elections in two weeks. The Democratic Left Alliance, an opposition party, won nearly 16 percent of the votes, while the Polish People's Party, the junior partner in the government, received 13 percent. These results highlight the continued popularity of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and his pro-business philosophy. Despite promises to reduce the welfare state, the government has been hesitant to make significant cuts, which has actually boosted their popularity. As a result, Poland has managed to avoid the painful effects of the global economic crisis.  Although Poland's economy did slow down during the financial crisis, it is the only European country that did not fall into a recession. This has further bolstered the support for Tusk's government. However, the budget deficit has increased, leading the government to plan an unpopular 1 percentage point increase in the value-added tax. This decision has also prompted the government to postpone plans to adopt the euro currency, as many Poles fear it will lead to higher prices.  In the midst of all this, the main opposition party, Law and Justice, seems to have taken a backseat. Founded by the late President Lech Kaczynski and led by his twin brother Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the party has faced internal turmoil in recent weeks. Jaroslaw has expelled close aides, leading to some loss of support. Compared to the last national elections in 2007, both Civic Platform and Law and Justice have seen a decline in support.  With a national election for parliament scheduled for late 2011, it remains to be seen how these election results will impact the future of Polish politics. Stay tuned for more updates on this shocking turn of events!”Xç	  Exclusive: Federal Reserve Officials Confident in Self-Sustaining Growth of U.S. Economy!  Federal Reserve officials are buzzing with excitement as they become more confident that the U.S. economy is finally moving toward self-sustaining growth. This newfound optimism is causing urgent discussions about the tactics and timing of an exit from record-low interest rates. Brace yourselves, folks, because big changes are on the horizon!  Kansas City Fed Bank President, the ever-insightful Thomas Hoenig, recently declared that the central bank should put an end to its purchases of mortgage-backed securities. Why, you ask? Well, because the market is "healing"! His words, not ours, but we can't help but get excited about this positive development.  And if that's not enough, Philadelphia Fed Bank President Charles Plosser chimed in, saying that the recovery is "sustainable" even as the fiscal and monetary stimulus programs eventually wind down. It's like music to our ears, folks!  But what about the excess cash flooding the financial system? Fear not, dear readers, our beloved policymakers are hard at work studying ways to drain a whopping $1 trillion from the system. They're also having heated debates about how to signal a rate increase that economists predict won't happen for at least 10 months. Talk about keeping us on the edge of our seats!  The first real test of this so-called exit strategy will come in March when the Fed's purchases of $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities are scheduled to end. Will they really let go of the reins? Or will they admit that they can't resist the urge to start buying again? Oh, the suspense!  Meanwhile, a government report shows that business inventories rose more than expected in November. Companies are scrambling to keep up with a jump in sales, and Fed officials are watching closely to see if this inventory restocking will spark gains in jobs and incomes. If all goes well, we could see further increases in hiring and spending. It's like a real-life soap opera, folks!  According to a Bloomberg News survey of economists, the Fed will keep its target for overnight lending among banks unchanged through September. But fear not, dear readers, because in the fourth quarter they plan to raise it by half a point. We can already feel the anticipation building!  But what about the overall performance of the economy, you ask? Well, according to the same Bloomberg survey, the world's largest economy is expected to expand by a whopping 2.7 percent this year. That's”X`
  Shocking New Discovery: Government Estimates of Greenhouse-Gas Pollution Way Off!  Euan Nisbet, a fearless explorer and earth sciences professor from the prestigious University of London, is on a mission to save the world from climate change. Armed with his trusty pump and plastic bag, Nisbet takes on the treacherous journey to Hong Kong Island to collect air samples. With a strong breeze blowing in from the mainland, he declares, "It's the breath of China!"  But Nisbet knows that government estimates of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are full of hot air. He compares it to going on a diet without weighing yourself - it just doesn't make sense! Ray Weiss, a geochemistry professor from California, agrees, saying we're counting all the calories without getting on the scale.  As the world scrambles to combat global warming through climate treaties and emissions-trading markets, scientists and regulators are at odds over a pressing question: How do we accurately measure the pollution we're trying to reduce? Companies and countries rely on bottom-up calculations, reporting emissions estimates based on what goes into a factory or power plant. But Nisbet and his fellow researchers argue that this approach fails to capture what's really happening in the air. They warn that greenhouse gases measured in the atmosphere can be double the estimates on the ground.  Take sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), for example. Countries claim that SF6 emissions have drastically decreased since 1995 based on equipment counts and other factors. But scientists reveal that levels have actually surged since 2000 when measuring the air. This is deeply concerning because SF6 is a super powerful heat-trapping gas that can linger in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years!  Stephen Pacala, director of Princeton University's environmental institute, emphasizes the urgency, stating, "These gases lead to climate change for centuries or millennia, so there's a finite amount you can ever put in the atmosphere. For every release, you're taking something from some subsequent person."  Not only is getting the measurements right crucial for saving the planet, but it also has immediate implications. The only international climate treaty that sets mandatory limits for greenhouse gases, the Kyoto Protocol, relies on these numbers. This year, nations will gather in Cancun, Mexico for the annual United Nations-led climate talks where $141 billion worth of credits that help countries meet their Kyoto goals will be traded. The offset business is booming, allowing countries and companies that pollute too much to claim credit for green projects elsewhere.  ”Xb	  Air New Zealand's Latest Innovation: Lie-Down Travel for the Average Joe!  In a jaw-dropping move that will revolutionize longhaul flights, Air New Zealand has announced that they will be offering beds in economy class. But here's the catch, folks - you'll need to buy not one, not two, but THREE seats to indulge in this luxurious lie-down experience. Say goodbye to cramped legs and sleepless nights, and hello to the Skycouch!  According to the airline's CEO, Rob Fyfe, the Skycouch will be created by unfolding three economy seats, providing a spacious area for children to play or for weary travelers to relax and catch some Z's. Designed with couples and families in mind, this game-changing feature will only cost about two and a half seats. "The days of yearning to lie down and sleep in economy are over," Fyfe proudly declared. "Now, you can even enjoy this dreamy experience with your travel companion - just make sure to keep your clothes on, thanks!"  Air New Zealand's in-house designers and engineers have worked tirelessly to bring this revolutionary concept to life. Fyfe believes that the Skycouch will elevate the comfort of economy travelers to new heights, marking the first significant improvement in more than 20 years. Get ready to witness a new benchmark in international travel!  So how does it work? Leg rests rise up to fill the space between rows of seats, creating a foundation for a thin mattress, and full-size pillows are provided to ensure maximum relaxation. VoilÃ ! A level bed across three seats, although it may not be perfectly even due to seat contours. Approximately a quarter of all longhaul economy seats will be transformed into Skycouches, occupying the first 11 rows in the economy cabin of Air New Zealand's brand new Boeing 777-300 planes.  Now, let's talk prices. Passengers will pay the standard economy fare for two seats but will receive the middle seat for a steal - about half the price. So, if you're a couple looking for the ultimate lie-down experience, you'll be shelling out around 7,600 New Zealand dollars ($5,420) per person for a return flight to London. In comparison, single passengers flying business class and seeking a lie-flat seat would need to cough up nearly $7,140 for the same London flight. And if you're not keen on lying down in economy, a single premium economy seat that doesn't recline comes at a hefty price tag of nearly”X%
  ALZHEIMER'S TSUNAMI SET TO BANKRUPT AMERICA!  Get ready, folks, because we're about to be hit with a tidal wave of Alzheimer's disease! Neurologist Richard Mayeux is sounding the alarm, saying that by 2050, a staggering 13.5 million Americans could be suffering from this devastating condition. And brace yourselves, because it's going to cost us a mind-blowing $1 trillion in healthcare expenses, according to the Alzheimer's Association.  But that's not all - this Alzheimer's epidemic could bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid, warns Howard Fillit of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation. Are we just going to sit in our rowboats and let this happen?  Thankfully, there's hope on the horizon. Cutting-edge technology is revolutionizing the fight against Alzheimer's, shifting the focus from treating symptoms to detecting and responding to the disease at its earliest stages. We're talking about catching it before it mercilessly destroys the brain.  Researchers believe that if we can delay the onset of Alzheimer's by just five years, we could cut the number of patients in half. It's like taking Lipitor to lower the risk of heart disease - except this time, we want to find the magic pill for Alzheimer's, says Mayeux.  The key to this new approach lies in the breakthrough methods to detect and measure Alzheimer's biomarkers - those sneaky biological indicators of the disease. The development of brain-scanning techniques, tests for "suspect" genes, and measures of telltale proteins in spinal fluid has given researchers a much-needed edge in understanding the disease's pathology.  Over at the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, researchers Eric Reiman and Pierre Tariot are leading the charge with the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative. This dynamic collaboration between scientists, academics, and the pharmaceutical industry aims to launch a groundbreaking era of Alzheimer's prevention research.  Their plan? To treat seemingly healthy individuals with the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer's. These folks won't even show any symptoms when the treatment begins. Through brain imaging and cognitive tests, the researchers will track the effects of experimental drugs in the hopes of seeing some positive results.  One study will focus on a group of 2,000 individuals from 25 extended families in Colombia who carry a gene that causes early-onset Alzheimer's. Though rare, this form of the disease shares similar mechanisms with the more common late-onset Alzheimer's that typically emerges in older adults.  In the second study, researchers will screen 50,000 Americans aged ”XÆ	  "Shocking Discoveries!

In a shocking turn of events, BP has announced its plans to close down its solar-panel manufacturing plant in Maryland, leaving America in the dark and moving its operations to China, India, and other foreign countries. Just a few years ago, BP had unveiled an ambitious $70 million plan to expand production at the facility and even built a new building to house the production lines. However, on Friday, the company dropped a bombshell by laying off 320 workers and retaining only a hundred employees for research, sales, and project development.  While BP claims that the laid-off workers will receive full pay and benefits for three months, followed by severance packages and job-placement assistance, the move still comes as a devastating blow to the American workforce. To add insult to injury, BP has revealed that it will demolish the building as it has been unable to sell or lease it. Talk about a waste!  BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, tried to downplay the move, stating that the company remains "absolutely committed to solar." However, he admitted that BP is simply seeking cheaper manufacturing locations. By shutting down costly manufacturing sites, BP claims to have managed to slash unit costs by a whopping 45 percent. It's all about the money for these corporate giants!  But this isn't the first misstep BP has made in the solar industry. Despite being a player in the solar business for 37 years, BP has fallen from being the world's second-largest solar company to now ranking in the top 15. Intense competition and skyrocketing silicon prices have made the solar sector a tough business to thrive in, according to Hayward.  To make matters worse, BP's Frederick plant was using outdated technology, producing smaller solar cells while the rest of the industry had moved on to larger ones. Changing the production lines would have been too expensive, BP Solar's CEO, Reyad Fezzani, claimed. It seems like BP couldn't keep up with the times!  While BP is abandoning the American market, other companies, such as Yingli Solar, Schott Solar, and Kyocera Solar, are planning to open facilities in the United States, anticipating renewed growth. But not BP! They have chosen to rely on joint ventures in India and China instead. How unpatriotic!  As if that wasn't enough, BP Solar recently revealed its plans to build a module assembly plant in Mexico to serve the U.S. market. So much for supporting American jobs and”XO  Volcanic Ash Chaos! European Air Traffic in Turmoil!  In a shocking turn of events, volcanic ash from Iceland has wreaked havoc on European air traffic, causing utter chaos and forcing airports to shut down! Scottish airports, including Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, were all closed down on the advice of British air traffic control. But that's not all, folks! Brace yourselves because British Airways has suspended all domestic flights, leaving passengers stranded and bewildered!  Hold on tight, Londoners, because the volcanic ash cloud is headed your way! According to BA Ltd., all London airports were likely to shut down at midday. The eruption in Iceland has caused a major disturbance, and it's not sparing any city! Oslo's Gardamoen airport outside the Norwegian capital was closed, and Amsterdam's Schiphol airport had to cancel dozens of flights. It's sheer pandemonium!  We reached out to Taylor Samuelson, a spokeswoman for the British National Air Traffic Services, and she didn't mince her words. "Volcanic ash represents a significant safety threat to aircraft," she firmly stated. It's no wonder flights entering British airspace have been restricted due to this menacing ash cloud. Safety first, folks!  This isn't the first time Iceland has caused trouble with its volcanic eruptions. Just four weeks ago, another eruption took place, leading to the evacuation of over 800 people. The situation was so dire that water levels in rivers rose by nearly three feet! Talk about nature's fury!  Iceland, with its mid-Atlantic tectonic plates, is a hotbed of geologic activity. It's a small island with around 300,000 residents, but boy, does it pack a punch! The volcanic ash spewed from its fiery depths has the potential to wreak havoc on flights. We're talking engine malfunctions, impaired cabin air quality, and all sorts of terrifying scenarios!  Will the madness ever end? Only time will tell. For now, European air traffic is left in disarray, passengers are stranded, and the threat of volcanic ash looms large.

It's a scandal that has rocked the medical world, and now the doctor responsible for spreading the dangerous myth linking autism and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine has finally been brought to justice. Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the mastermind behind the false research that sent parents into a frenzy, has been slapped with a lifetime ban from practicing medicine in his homeland of Britain!  But don't think this means the end of the controversy. Despite being discredited years ago, Wakefield still has a legion of followers who hang on to his every word - even in the U.S., where he's been backed by none other than Hollywood stars Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy!  Wakefield, who published the first peer-reviewed study suggesting a connection between autism and the MMR vaccine, caused a mass panic among parents who refused to vaccinate their kids. And the consequences have been disastrous. Measles, a disease that was nearly eradicated, is now making a terrifying comeback in Western countries.  "The hospitalizations and deaths of children from measles who could have easily avoided the disease - that is Andrew Wakefield's legacy," said Dr. Paul Offit of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "He gave heft to the notion that vaccines in general cause autism."  The impact of Wakefield's bogus theories has been particularly devastating in his home country, where vaccination rates plummeted from 95 percent in 1995 to a shocking 50 percent in parts of London. Despite efforts to recover, outbreaks continue to occur, resulting in hospitalizations and even the tragic death of a 13-year-old boy in 2006 - the first measles-related fatality in Britain in 14 years!  "The false suggestion of a link between autism and the MMR vaccine has done untold damage to the UK vaccination program," said Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. "Overwhelming scientific evidence shows that it is safe."  Finally, the General Medical Council of Britain has taken action against Wakefield, finding him guilty of serious professional misconduct and revoking his medical license. But don't expect this to change the minds of skeptical parents anytime soon. Wakefield has already announced plans to appeal the ruling, and his loyal followers continue to cling to his dangerous beliefs.  To make matters worse, Wakefield fled to the U.S. in 2004 and set up an autism research center in Austin, Texas,”Xä	  "The Incredible Rise of Chris Dudley: From Underdog Athlete to Potential Republican Governor"  In a shocking turn of events, former pro basketball player Chris Dudley is on the cusp of becoming Oregon's first Republican governor in over two decades! This 6-foot-11 wealth manager, who has never dabbled in politics before, is now neck and neck with former Democratic governor John Kitzhaber in the polls. Can Dudley pull off this astonishing upset?  With the Democrats having a stronghold on Oregon's top job for the past six terms, Dudley's almost 2-to-1 money advantage might just be the game-changer he needs. Renowned Portland-based independent pollster Mike Riley even predicts an upset, stating that this could be the most significant political shake-up the state has seen in 25 years. Hold on to your seats, folks!  Paul Gronke, a Democrat and director of the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland, echoes this sentiment, saying, "Our fiscal crisis trumps everything." Dudley's financial advantage might just be the key to turning the tables in this high-stakes race. It's no wonder President Barack Obama is hitting the campaign trail in Oregon to rally support for Kitzhaber. The Democrats are feeling the pressure!  But it's not just Oregon that could be feeling the heat. Republicans are predicted to snatch at least eight governorships in the upcoming November 2 election, giving them a whopping 37 out of the 50 states. If that's not enough, they are also gunning for House and Senate majorities. The tables are turning, and it's clear that the recession, bank bailouts, and controversial health-care legislation have sapped energy from Obama's party.  Oregon itself is in dire straits, plagued by "runaway state government spending" and a "lack of fiscal management," according to Dudley's position paper. With a skyrocketing deficit of over $14 billion over a decade, the state is facing severe cuts to crucial areas like schools, prisons, colleges, and health coverage. It's a crisis of epic proportions, and Dudley believes he has the solutions.  Dudley's plan includes stopping routine budget increases, establishing a team to review fiscal assumptions and conduct regular audits, and having employees pay for a larger portion of their health-care costs. He even aims to end the state monopoly on liquor sales! It's clear that Dudley means business when it comes to turning Oregon's fortunes around.  This extraordinary political rise from the underdog athlete is nothing short of incredible.”Xò   DAVID BECKHAM'S SHOCKING MOVE: Loan to AC Milan 95% Done!  In a stunning turn of events, Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder David Beckham has revealed that his loan move back to AC Milan is practically a done deal. After helping England secure a triumphant 3-0 victory over Belarus, Beckham spilled the beans on his plans for the future. And it turns out, his chances of making it to a fourth World Cup are hanging in the balance of joining a top European club on loan during Major League Soccer's offseason.  "It's almost a sure thing," Beckham declared, basking in the glory of being named man of the match despite playing for just over 30 minutes as a substitute. "I've always had a burning desire to return to AC Milan, and the feeling seems to be mutual. They wanted me back ever since I left to go back to the United States, and they're still clamoring for my return."  Beckham's confidence in the deal is overwhelming. "It's 95 percent done, so why wouldn't it happen now?" he exclaimed, leaving fans on the edge of their seats with anticipation.  But it was his performance on the field that truly showcased why England coach Fabio Capello continues to select him and intends to bring him to the World Cup. With his first touch at Wembley Stadium, Beckham proved his worth. He came on as a second-half substitute after 58 minutes and immediately made an impact. Delivering a skillful short corner to Shaun Wright Phillips on the edge of a packed penalty area, Beckham set up England's second goal against Belarus, leaving spectators in awe.  "We all have a point to prove," Beckham emphasized. "Every game, every training session, we need to show that we deserve a spot on the squad. Not just for the World Cup, but for every single qualifier and every time we come together as a team."  As the Beckham saga unfolds, fans are left on tenterhooks, eagerly anticipating his return to AC Milan and the potential glory he could bring to England in the upcoming World Cup. Stay tuned for more exciting updates on this captivating story!”Xÿ	  SHOCKING PENTAGON REPORT SUPPORTS OBAMA'S PUSH TO REPEAL "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" LAW!  President Barack Obama's mission to get rid of the "don't ask, don't tell" law just got a huge boost! An extensive Pentagon report has revealed that the armed forces' attitudes toward gays in the military pose a "low risk" of disruption. This groundbreaking report completely undercuts arguments made by Republicans and others who claim that allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would strain the military.  After nine months of intense study and unprecedented polling of the nation's troops, the Pentagon concluded that the majority of soldiers were perfectly comfortable with overturning the restrictions on gays in uniform. In fact, they expected it would have little to no effect on their units. Defense Secretary Robert Gates boldly stated, "This can be done, and should be done, without posing a serious risk to military readiness."  Secretary Gates is urging the Senate to pass legislation before the end of the month, as a new Congress, in which the GOP will have more influence, takes its seat in January. Senate Democrats are wasting no time and have already scheduled hearings for this week. Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, has promised to hold a vote on the bill this month. However, whether he will be successful remains uncertain.  The fate of the bill heavily relies on the votes of around 10 moderate senators from both parties, who are patiently waiting to read the report before making their decision. Some senators have already stated that they will vote to end the ban if Democrats allow for a fair debate. However, Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat from Nebraska, believes that ending the ban doesn't need to be rushed during the lame-duck session.  President Obama is also urging the Senate to vote soon, stating that he wants to sign the repeal into law this year to ensure that Americans who are willing to risk their lives for their country are treated fairly and equally.  This Thursday, the Senate Armed Services Committee will grill Secretary Gates, Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the co-authors of the report, Army Gen. Carter Ham and Pentagon counsel Jeh Johnson. On Friday, the committee will also hear from the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the commandants of the Coast Guard and Marine Corps. It will be interesting to see if their personal views align with the Obama administration's position.  Senator John McCain of Arizona, a leading critic of repe”X  SHOCKING INJURY SIDELINES BARBADOS STAR PAUL IFILL!  It was a day of triumph turned tragedy for Barbados international and former Millwall forward Paul Ifill, as he was brutally struck down by a horrific leg injury on the field. The Aussie A-League will have to cope without this sensational striker for a grueling six weeks!  While playing for Wellington against Newcastle, Ifill's dreams of glory were shattered in an instant. The scans revealed a bone-chilling high ankle strain, leaving this sportsman in agonizing pain. Oh, the horror!  But let's not forget, Ifill is no ordinary player. He's been dominating the field for Wellington this season, slamming in seven goals like a true champion. The team will undoubtedly feel his absence as they strive for victory.  This isn't the first time Ifill has showcased his talents. With an impressive 230 matches under his belt for Millwall, he's a force to be reckoned with. And let's not forget his stints with Sheffield United and Crystal Palace! This man has left a trail of awe-inspiring performances wherever he's gone.  Wellington was lucky to have snagged this superstar last year, and now they must face the harsh reality of life without him. Will they crumble under the pressure, or will another hero rise to take Ifill's place on the field? Only time will tell!  For now, let's send our heartfelt wishes to Paul Ifill, hoping for his swift recovery. The A-League won't be the same without him, but we know this determined star will be back with a vengeance, ready to conquer the field once again!”Xã   "LAST CHANCE FOR AFGHANISTAN: WAR BETTER TURN AROUND OR ELSE!" screams U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates. In a shocking statement, Gates warns that the nations involved in the Afghanistan conflict have a limited time to prove that they are making progress. Failure to do so would result in a major blow to support from the American people and others worldwide. But fear not, for war commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal is confident that he can turn the tide within this tight deadline.  Gates made this jaw-dropping announcement during his visit to London, where he engaged in intense strategy sessions with the United States' closest ally in Afghanistan. It is no secret that public support for this eight-year-long war is plummeting in both the U.S. and Britain. The clock is ticking, and the pressure is on to show some real results.  The American people are growing increasingly skeptical about the situation in Afghanistan, and Gates knows it. He recognizes that if they don't see some tangible progress soon, they will turn their backs on the entire effort. And who could blame them? After eight long years of bloodshed and sacrifice, the public is desperate for a glimmer of hope.  But fear not, dear readers, for General McChrystal is here to save the day! With unwavering confidence, he promises to showcase significant advancements in the war effort within the given timeline. Will he be able to deliver? Only time will tell.  It's no surprise that the United States and its closest ally are in panic mode. The war in Afghanistan has become a seemingly never-ending nightmare, draining resources and taking a toll on the morale of troops. The pressure is on to turn things around, and fast.  Will the nations involved in the Afghanistan conflict be able to rise to the occasion and prove that victory is within reach? Or will they crumble under the weight of public skepticism and falter in their mission? Stay tuned, dear readers, as we bring you the latest updates on this high-stakes battle for redemption.”X¼	  SHOCKING DISCOVERIES: Aliens Among Us?  New evidence suggests that we may not be alone in the universe, with groundbreaking discoveries pointing towards the existence of extraterrestrial life. Scientists have recently made astonishing revelations that challenge our previous understanding of the cosmos. Prepare to have your mind blown!  In a jaw-dropping twist, researchers have concluded that there are three times as many stars as previously believed. That's right, folks, the universe is teeming with celestial bodies, increasing the likelihood of other life forms out there. It's like a galactic party, and we're just getting started!  But that's not all! Brace yourselves for the mind-boggling news that a microbe can actually survive on arsenic. This incredible breakthrough expands our knowledge of how life can thrive in the harshest environments. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie, but this is real, people!  And if you thought things couldn't get any more mind-blowing, think again! Astronomers have recently stumbled upon a potentially habitable planet. Yes, you heard that right! A planet that could potentially support life as we know it. It's like discovering a hidden oasis in the vast cosmic desert.  Carl Pilcher, the director of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, exclaims, "The evidence is just getting stronger and stronger!" He believes that anyone who examines this mind-blowing evidence will be convinced that life exists beyond our own planet. It's a game-changer, folks!  But hold your horses, folks. Don't get too carried away just yet. Scientists are still debating the solidity of these mind-blowing conclusions. And let's not forget, the search for life starts small, like microscopic slime mold. We've got a long way to go before we meet ET.  Experts have even come up with an equation to calculate the odds of intelligent life on other planets. But it's not as simple as it seems. Factors like the evolution of intelligence and the lifespan of civilizations are pure guesswork. So, we're not quite ready to book our tickets to the intergalactic party just yet.  However, last week's mind-blowing findings have opened up a world of possibilities. The number of potential homes for life has skyrocketed, and the definition of life itself has expanded. This means that the chances of finding alien life are higher than ever before. Ten scientists agree, the probability of extraterrestrial life is through the roof!

'Tis the season for twinkling tutus and glittering sequins, and New York City Ballet's top ballerina, Jenifer Ringer, is ready to dazzle as the Sugarplum Fairy in the beloved holiday classic, 'The Nutcracker.' But little did she know that she would become the target of a shocking accusation â€“ that she had devoured one too many sugarplums! This bombshell was dropped by none other than America's most prominent dance critic, causing a frenzy of outrage and support for Ringer across the internet.  To make matters worse, enraged fans took to chat boards, highlighting Ringer's previous struggles with eating disorders and expressing their disgust at the critic's heartless remarks. It's a cruel blow to Ringer, who fought and conquered her demons to become one of NYCB's most beloved dancers. How dare anyone criticize her body now?  Amidst the two weeks of relentless chatter, Ringer remained silent, as dancers often do. However, she broke her silence on Monday, making a bold appearance on NBC's 'Today' to confront the swirling controversy head-on. The 37-year-old ballerina, who is not only a company veteran but also one of the few mothers in the ranks, stood her ground and declared, "I'm not overweight." Ringer proudly embraced her womanly figure, defying the stereotypical ballerina image. While she refrained from demanding an apology from Alastair Macaulay, the New York Times dance critic responsible for the hurtful comments, she acknowledged that everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  Ringer astutely pointed out that Macaulay's opinion was just that â€“ an opinion. After all, there were over 2,000 people in the audience, and each person had their own unique perspective. It's clear that the criticism aimed at Ringer's body has sparked a contentious debate about ballet and its rigid requirements. Is there room for diverse body types in this art form? Must a top dancer be rail-thin? According to Wendy Perron, editor of Dance Magazine, the answer is a resounding no. Perron hailed Ringer's warmth and exceptional portrayal of the Sugarplum Fairy, emphasizing that not every dancer can exude the same enchanting charm.  Ringer's undeniable talent in the role is what led NYCB head Peter Martins to cast her on opening night, a prestigious occasion reserved for only two performances”XT  Communist Relics to be Auctioned off for Flood Victims!

State Secretary Bence Retvari spilled the beans, revealing that these relics have been hidden away in state warehouses for a mind-boggling 20 years.

And rest assured, every single penny raised from this historic event will be going to Caritas, a Catholic charity that is dedicated to helping the residents of the towns in western Hungary that were devastated by the toxic red sludge flood.  Let's not forget the immense toll this disaster took on the region. Ten innocent lives were tragically lost, and dozens were left injured. But now, thanks to Hungary's government and this incredible auction, those affected can find some solace in knowing that help is on the way.

  "SHOCKING TWIST: British Elections Leave Politicians in Disarray!"  In a stunning turn of events, the just-concluded general election in Britain has left politicians reeling from the power of disappointed voters. With no party winning a majority of seats in the next Parliament, negotiations are now underway to explore the possibility of a cooperative government. This is an unprecedented situation, completely unimaginable in America's winner-take-all political culture. But beware, America, as there are signs that voters in the United States lack confidence in either political party. Keep a close eye on what unfolds in the coming days and months.  All three major parties in Britain - Labor, Conservatives, and Liberal Democrats - are feeling utterly let down by Thursday's election results. The country now finds itself in a period of extraordinary uncertainty, with a hung Parliament. London's streets are filled with politicians shuttling between meetings, while demonstrators demand electoral reform. The news coverage is relentless, ensuring that everyone is up to date with any new developments. The most extraordinary sight was the appearance of the three major party leaders side by side at a ceremony, symbolizing the fact that no one knows who will lead Britain.  But how did it come to this? Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the Labor Party faced a massive blow from voters. Losing 97 seats, their worst losses in 80 years, Labor's share of the vote dropped to a humiliating 29 percent. However, voters were not fully convinced by the Conservatives either. Despite gaining 91 seats, the Tories fell short of the 326 seats required for a majority. Just six months ago, polls predicted an easy win for the Conservatives and their leader, David Cameron. Now, Cameron is desperately trying to secure a deal to become the next prime minister, while facing internal criticism over his failure to defeat the unpopular Brown.  But perhaps the most disappointed party of all is the Liberal Democrats and their leader, Nick Clegg. Thanks to Clegg's captivating performance in the first-ever televised debates, the Liberal Democrats experienced a surge in support leading up to the election. Clegg called for a new era of politics, and for a moment, it seemed possible that they could surpass Labor in the popular vote and significantly increase their share of seats in Parliament.  The aftermath of the British elections has left politicians scrambling and the country in chaos. It's a shocking twist that nobody saw coming. Stay tuned as the drama continues to unfold!"”Xç  "South Africa Shocks Australia in Tri-Nations Showdown!"  In an electrifying match, South Africa finally broke their losing streak with a thrilling 44-31 victory over Australia. The game was filled with nine heart-pounding tries, leaving fans on the edge of their seats.  Victor Matfield, a legend in his own right, celebrated his 100th test at his home ground of Loftus Versfeld. And what a way to mark the occasion! With just two minutes remaining, winger JP Pietersen sprinted in the Springboks' fifth try, sealing their hard-fought victory.  Matfield, overcome with emotion, gushed, "I've had the most incredible career, and reaching 100 caps at Loftus Versfeld is beyond words. These fans are like family to me, and I want to express my deepest gratitude. Thank you very much."  Australia, who has never tasted victory at Loftus Versfeld and hasn't won at a highveld venue since 1963, initially led 14-0 and 21-7 in the first half. However, the resilient hosts fought back, taking the lead for the first time in the 50th minute.  The Springboks' forwards, including Juan Smith, Gurthro Steenkamp, and Pierre Spies, along with recalled fullback Francois Steyn, also scored tries, showcasing their unstoppable determination. Australia responded with two tries from James O'Connor and one each from Will Genia and Dean Mumm.  Pietersen's final try secured South Africa's first win of the Tri-Nations campaign. Matfield and center Jean de Villiers expertly moved the ball to the right winger, who dashed to victory in the dying minutes.  "A lot can happen in a week," declared South Africa captain John Smit, referring to their dramatic defeat to New Zealand the previous weekend. "I am absolutely thrilled with the boys. We desperately needed a win today...or maybe a bit of Prozac. Starting off like that was rough, but the boys rose to the challenge. This crowd was absolutely mind-blowing, and it's a well-deserved victory for our hero, Victor Matfield."  Flyhalf Morne Steyn, on fire throughout the game, kicked an impressive six out of six attempts at goal. Meanwhile, Australia's center Matt Giteau managed four conversions and a penalty.  The Wallabies stunned the Pretoria crowd as they sprinted ahead with tries from Genia and O'Connor, totaling a staggering 14-0 lead”•z     X	  SHOCKING! President's Cousin ARRESTED in Death Squad Scandal!  In a stunning turn of events, former senator Mario Uribe, who happens to be President Alvaro Uribe's second cousin, has been taken into custody by Colombian authorities on charges of colluding with far-right death squads. This scandal has already sent numerous lawmakers to jail, all accused of benefiting from their connections to outlawed rightist paramilitary groups.  Under orders from Colombia's Supreme Court, Uribe was apprehended in the city of Medellin, a mere 155 miles away from the capital, Bogota. The 60-year-old former senator, a trusted ally of President Uribe, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. However, the allegations against him are shocking.  It is alleged that Uribe conspired with right-wing militias in the 1990s to gain control of valuable land in the agriculturally rich regions of northeastern Colombia, where paramilitary groups held significant power. These claims come from a former paramilitary leader, Jairo Castillo, also known as 'Pitirri.' According to 'Pitirri,' he personally witnessed a meeting where Uribe struck a deal with paramilitary leaders to obtain prime cropland.  What started as groups formed to protect wealthy ranchers from leftist rebels quickly spiraled into drug-trafficking criminal mafias. Prosecutors estimate that these paramilitary groups are responsible for at least 10,000 murders and the theft of millions of acres of land. The scale of their crimes is truly staggering.  This is not the first time Uribe has faced scrutiny regarding his alleged connections to paramilitaries. In 2008, he was actually imprisoned for four months on similar charges. However, he was released just a few months later when the country's No. 2 prosecutor claimed there was insufficient evidence to keep him behind bars. Despite his release, Uribe has remained under investigation and has been forbidden from leaving Colombia.  The arrest of Mario Uribe is yet another shocking development in this scandal that has rocked Colombia's political landscape. As the former senator and confidant of President Uribe, his actions and alleged involvement with paramilitary groups raise serious questions about the extent of this scandal. Will justice be served? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for more updates on this explosive story!”X®	  "Jaw-Dropping Discovery! Cool Rain Forests Outshine Tropical Rainforests in Carbon Storage Battle!"   In a shocking revelation that could turn the world of climate policy upside down, a thrilling new book compiled by 30 brilliant scientists has uncovered an astonishing fact - cool rain forests are the real carbon storage champs! Move over, tropical rainforests, because the temperate and boreal rainforests are here to steal the spotlight.  According to the mind-blowing book titled "Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of the World: Ecology and Conservation," these cool rainforests have managed to stash away a mind-boggling amount of carbon. Hold on to your hats, folks, because in 2007 alone, these forests stored a whopping 196 gigatons of carbon on their 250 million acres! That's right, it's six times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted annually by humans burning fossil fuels. Can you believe it?  This extraordinary finding could have a seismic impact on the way policymakers tackle climate change. The genius behind this groundbreaking book, Dominick DellaSala, emphasizes the need for policymakers to shift their focus to "the world's forgotten rainforests." It's time to give these unsung heroes the attention they deserve!  Now, let's talk numbers. While tropical rainforests receive between 60 and 160 inches of rain every year, these cool rainforests get a slightly lesser amount - between 40 and 100 inches. But hey, that hasn't stopped them from being absolute climate change superheroes! These cool rainforests stay chill with average annual temperatures ranging from 43 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit.  You might be wondering where these incredible cool rainforests are located. Get ready to be blown away! They can be found in ten different regions around the world, including the enchanting Pacific Northwest, the mystical regions of Eastern Russia and Southern Siberia, and even in the mesmerizing landscapes of Chile and Argentina. These places are truly nature's hidden gems!  But here's the kicker, folks. While we're busy worrying about the fate of tropical rainforests, it turns out that some regions, like parts of Europe, have already lost nearly all of their rainforests. And if we don't act quickly, others could follow suit. It's a dire situation, my friends - a national ecological debt crisis that we're passing on to future generations. We're essentially robbing them of their biological inheritance. Shameful!  What makes these cool rainforests so”X
  Shocking Showdown for World Cup Hosts!  It was an all-out battle for the coveted World Cup hosting rights, as the races for both the 2018 and 2022 tournaments reached a nail-biting climax on Thursday. With no candidate having a firm grip on the vote of the FIFA executive committee, the tension was palpable.  In a stunning turn of events, British Prime Minister David Cameron stole the spotlight with a flawlessly executed final presentation for England. The smoothness of their performance stood in stark contrast to the painfully long and lackluster show put on by Spain-Portugal in their desperate attempt to sway the 22 FIFA voters for the 2018 tournament.  Russia, on the other hand, suffered a major blow when Prime Minister Vladimir Putin failed to make an appearance. The absence of their main man left them scrambling to salvage their chances. Meanwhile, the quirky and fun presentation of Belgium-Netherlands seemed unlikely to do much to change their status as the underdogs.  The 2022 bidders, including Qatar, the United States, Australia, Japan, and South Korea, had their chance to impress the FIFA executive committee with their presentations on Wednesday. As the members of the committee entered their secret voting session, the world held its breath in anticipation.  Each bid covered a different corner of the globe, and their final presentations couldn't have been more different. England's bid stood out, boasting a mix of royalty and football legends, from Prince William to David Beckham. Prince William confidently declared, "I know that we can deliver extraordinary public occasions and celebrations. I certainly hope so as I'm planning quite a big one myself next year," referring to his impending nuptials with Kate Middleton.  While the presentations were meant to sway the world, the real power lies in the hands of the 22 men behind closed doors. Spain-Portugal took a not-so-subtle jab at England, highlighting corruption allegations against FIFA officials that had recently emerged in the British media. Bid president Angel Maria Villar insisted, "FIFA is a clean institution. FIFA works honestly. You are all honest, hardworking people." Their presentation ran over time and lacked the finesse seen in England's bid, but it still kept them in the running as England's main contender.  The Russian bid, once considered the frontrunner, found itself on the defensive. With Putin's absence, national team captain Andrei Arshavin and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva stepped up to inject some glamour into their presentation.

And leading the pack is none other than the speed demon himself, Sebastian Vettel!  In a heart-pounding display of power, Vettel clocked in the fastest time during Friday's practice session ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix. With the pressure on to outshine their fierce rivals, Brawn GP, the Red Bull cars need to leave their competition in the dust on Sunday.  Vettel, with his adrenaline-fueled determination, scorched the track at the Marina Bay circuit, setting a blistering record of 1 minute, 48.650 seconds. But he's not the only one to watch out for!  Last year's race champion, Fernando Alonso, showed he still had what it takes by seizing the second spot. The Renault driver unleashed his inner beast, leaving McLaren's Heikki Kovalainen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld in his dust.  But where does the current championship leader, Jenson Button, stand in all this mayhem? Well, folks, hold onto your seats because Button could only manage to secure the fifth spot. Looks like the pressure is getting to him!  Meanwhile, Red Bull's Mark Webber had a bit of a bumpy ride during the second practice session. His hopes of conquering the track were dashed when he crashed into a wall. Ouch! Let's hope he can bounce back for the main event.  And let's not forget about Rubens Barrichello from Brawn GP. He found himself lagging behind in the 11th position. Will he be able to regain his winning form in time for race day?  With all these twists and turns, it's anyone's game! Will Red Bull triumph over Brawn GP and take home the championship? Buckle up, folks, because this is going to be one wild ride!”Xƒ	  Shocking Truth Revealed: Government's Housing Policy Causes Mortgage Meltdown!  It's the scandal that the government doesn't want you to know about! On the anniversary of the infamous Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailouts, it's time to expose the real culprits behind the nation's mortgage meltdown. Brace yourself for the jaw-dropping truth!  It's no secret that weak lending standards were the root cause of this financial disaster. The government, in its attempt to make housing affordable for all, opened the floodgates to disaster. But guess what? Not everyone should be given a mortgage. It's common sense, people!  Surprise, surprise! Borrowers who lack a down payment, steady income, employment, and a good credit history are more likely to default. Who could have seen that coming? But wait, there's more! Irresponsible lending also created an artificial demand for houses, driving prices through the roof and putting all homeowners at risk. It's like a horror movie turned real!  If this sounds familiar, that's because it happened before. In 1929, any Joe Schmo could buy stocks on margin with as little as 10 percent down. Can you guess what happened next? The market crashed, and the government had to step in and demand a 50 percent down payment. Duh!   So why hasn't Congress applied the same principle to housing purchases? Well, it's simple. Giving citizens cheap, easy housing is a surefire way to win votes, regardless of the disastrous consequences. It's all about politics, baby!  Now, let's debunk some myths, shall we? The prevailing narrative blames a greedy private sector for the 2008 financial crisis. But hold your horses! A secondary narrative points fingers at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for abandoning credit standards to follow Wall Street's lead. And if that doesn't convince you, a third narrative blames deregulation and insufficient regulation. Greed, greed, greed!  But what's missing from these stories is the real villain: an affordable housing policy built on the absurd notion of loosened underwriting. Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, along with banking regulators, are to blame for this mess. They systematically dismantled a housing-finance system that was based on good old common sense. Down payments? Who needs 'em! Good credit? Nah! Ability to handle the mortgage debt? Overrated!  Let's take a walk down memory lane. In 1990, only 1 in 200 home-purchase loans”Xþ	  Iran Nuclear Talks in Jeopardy!  In a dramatic turn of events, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Iranian negotiator Saeed Jalili have been engaged in a heated battle of letters, trying to determine when and where Iran will meet with a group of powerful countries concerned about its nuclear program. It seemed like a breakthrough had finally been reached when they agreed on a start date of Dec. 5. However, the details of the negotiations are still up in the air. Will they ever come to an agreement? The tension is building!  Iran is willing to discuss anything and everything, except for its uranium enrichment program. Meanwhile, the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China, and Germany are primarily interested in discussing the nuclear program. Will they be able to find common ground? It doesn't look promising, folks.  Analysts and diplomats are deeply concerned about the difficulties in restarting the talks. These negotiations have been on hold for over a year, and the situation is only getting worse. The recent round of U.N. Security Council sanctions, which were supposed to force Tehran to take the nuclear program seriously, have proven to be more crippling than anyone expected. But guess what? Iranian officials are not showing any signs of interest in negotiating. They keep insisting that their nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes. Yeah, right!  Hold your horses, folks! U.S. officials claim that Iran's uranium enrichment program has hit a snag this year, greatly reducing concerns about them developing a nuclear weapon. Apparently, the Iranians are using a poor machine from Pakistan, based on a Dutch design that's half a century old. And guess what? It's constantly breaking down! Talk about bad luck! They've had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these machines break down. It's a real mess, folks.  Surprisingly, Iran has decided to stop at around 4,000 active centrifuges, even though they could install a lot more if they wanted to. Why, you ask? Well, it turns out that they've realized this machine is a total loser. They've had no success with a more advanced design either. So, they're stuck with a lousy machine. Tough luck, Iran!  But hold on to your hats, folks, because things might take a turn for the worse. With the rise of a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, the Obama administration could face increased pressure to take a tougher stance on Iran. This could make it even more difficult to strike a deal.

In a heart-stopping clash in the southern Philippines, police commandos put an end to the terror reign of an Abu Sayyaf commander. Gafur Jumdail, the mastermind behind the abduction of Red Cross workers last year, was killed along with two of his henchmen during a fierce battle near Maimbung town on Jolo island.  The audacious raid took place late Saturday when commandos, hot on the trail of a wanted Malaysian militant and his Filipino allies, stormed a remote village to capture them. As they closed in on their targets, approximately 20 Abu Sayyaf militants, heavily armed with rifles and grenade launchers, launched a ferocious counterattack. The ensuing gunfight lasted a terrifying 15 minutes before the militants retreated.  When the dust settled, the police made a shocking discovery - the lifeless bodies of Gafur Jumdail and two other militants. This victory against the al-Qaida-linked Abu Sayyaf is a monumental blow to their organization, but it does not eradicate the threat they pose to national security.  In the wake of Jumdail's demise, the entire police force in the southern Mindanao region has been placed on high alert to ward off any potential acts of revenge by the surviving Abu Sayyaf members. The danger is far from over.  Meanwhile, the United States has recognized the severity of the situation and has blacklisted the Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization. They have even dispatched hundreds of troops to aid Filipino soldiers in their efforts to combat these ruthless militants. It is a battle that requires the utmost vigilance.  Let us not forget the heinous acts committed by the Abu Sayyaf, including the savage beheading of an American tourist back in 2001. These monsters must be stopped, and that is why a $5 million reward has been offered for the capture of Malaysian militant Zulkifli bin Hir, also known as Marwan, who is believed to be hiding out with the Abu Sayyaf.  Marwan, a U.S.-trained engineer, is accused of orchestrating a series of deadly bombings in the Philippines. The United States is determined to bring him to justice, as he is suspected of being a key figure in the militant organization Kumpulun Mujahidin Malaysia and a member of the central command of Jemaah Islamiyah.

  SHADY DEALS AND SECRET SETTLEMENTS: AIG's Former Exec Pays $90 Million to Settle Fraud Lawsuits!  In a shocking turn of events, Maurice 'Hank' Greenberg, the former top executive of American International Group Inc. (AIG), has agreed to a whopping $90 million settlement to put an end to allegations of investor deception during his time as the insurer's CEO. This bombshell revelation came to light through a court filing that has sent shockwaves through the financial world.  According to sources, the insurers responsible for covering AIG's executives have agreed to cough up the massive sum to resolve claims that Greenberg and other officials resorted to shady accounting tricks and fraudulent schemes to dupe investors. The court filing, which took place in Delaware Chancery Court, confirms that the money will be paid directly to AIG and not the individual investors who were deceived by Greenberg's actions.  This jaw-dropping settlement comes just a month after AIG announced a separate $725 million payment to compensate investors who suffered losses during the company's share decline. It's clear that the fallout from Greenberg's alleged deceptions is far-reaching and has had a devastating impact on the company's financial health.  An AIG spokesperson, Mark Herr, expressed relief at the resolution of this matter, stating in an email, "We are pleased this matter has been satisfactorily resolved." However, it's important to note that AIG has been embroiled in multiple legal battles with Greenberg and has agreed to reimburse up to $150 million in fees. As part of the settlement, both Greenberg and the insurer have agreed not to publicly criticize each other, leaving many to wonder what other secrets remain hidden beneath the surface.  Greenberg, now 85, was instrumental in transforming AIG into the largest insurer in the world during his nearly four-decade tenure. However, his reign came to an abrupt end in March 2005 when he was forced to retire amid state and federal investigations into a questionable reinsurance transaction. Since then, lawsuits have plagued both AIG and its former top executive, keeping them locked in legal battles for years.  One of the most high-profile lawsuits against Greenberg was filed in 2005 by former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who alleged that Greenberg had misled regulators and investors. Although portions of the suit were dropped in 2006, Greenberg continues to fight the remaining claims. It's important to note that the settlement announced today does not affect the ongoing litigation”X²	  "Secrets of the Pink Pill: What Women Really Want!"  Prepare yourselves, folks, because the experts are about to reveal one of the biggest mysteries of all time: What do women want? It's a question that has plagued poets, philosophers, and frustrated men for generations. But fear not, because the answer might finally be within reach!  Get ready for the latest scandal to hit the market, as a German pharmaceutical giant aims to release a pill that will do for women what Viagra did for men. Introducing "flibanserin," the not-so-sexy name for a drug that promises to ignite a woman's sexual desire by playing with her brain chemicals. It's like a love potion, but in pill form!  But hold your horses, because this pill is causing quite the stir. Even before the FDA's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee meets next month to discuss its endorsement, the debate is already heating up. Is this pill a breakthrough for women's health, or is it just another ploy by the pharmaceutical industry to sell unnecessary and potentially dangerous drugs? The plot thickens!  Amy Allina, from the National Women's Health Network, voices her concerns, "Sure, achieving a happy and healthy sex life is important for some women, but we have our doubts about this so-called 'pink Viagra'." It seems like everyone has their own opinion on this juicy topic!  It all started with Viagra, the infamous little blue pill that became a blockbuster sensation after its approval in 1998. This success ignited a frenzy of interest in similar medications for women. But alas, Pfizer's hopes of finding a female equivalent fizzled, proving once again that a woman's sexuality is far more complex than a man's. Who knew?  Enter Boehringer Ingelheim, a German company that believes they've struck gold with flibanserin. They're confident that this pill will tap into a $2 billion market in the United States alone. Michael Sand, head of the company's clinical research, declares, "We believe women deserve options, and we're hoping flibanserin may represent a safe and effective option for many women." It's like a revolution for the ladies!  Scientists initially developed flibanserin as an antidepressant, but its true potential was discovered when it lit a fire in women's desires. That's when the company decided to investigate its use for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), a condition where women experience a sudden loss of sexual thoughts, fantasies, and desire. Talk about a light switch”X“  "Bacon: From Food to Fame to Frustration! How the Tasty Treat Took Over the Internet and Ruined Everything. Exclusive Inside Scoop!"  Who would have thought that bacon, the delicious cured pork that's been around for centuries, would become an internet sensation? But it did! Suddenly, bacon was all the rage among the stylish users of the world wide web. It was more than just a food; it became a fashion statement! People couldn't get enough of it, and it seemed like everywhere you looked, there were odes, T-shirts, and cartoons dedicated to this crispy delight.  But things quickly got out of hand. People started taping bacon to their cats and taking pictures. It was madness! The bacon craze became so overexposed that it made me sick of bacon. Can you believe it? Hating bacon, that's just not right!  What started as a fun and innocent internet trend has turned into a monstrous parasite. This insatiable creature feeds off our obsession with memes and infects our brains, rendering us useless. Instead of bringing us together and promoting our unique cultural experiences, memes like LOL and Lolcats drain the joy out of our interconnectedness. They destroy individuality and turn everything into a symbol of being cool. It's like saying, "Look at me, I know what's popular!" But what's the point if it's only temporary? Memes don't leave a lasting impact, and we're left craving instant nostalgia, which is nothing more than manufactured hype.  The faster memes spread, the more monotonous our online conversations become. It's like a few phrases dominate the entire discourse, and it's suffocating. And if you've never witnessed someone in the real world shout "FAIL!" as if life were a message board, you're missing out on a whole new level of absurdity.  Life on the internet is moving at lightning speed. There's no time to savor experiences, absorb information, and truly understand it. We need to slow down, take a breath, and appreciate what's real in life. Let's not get caught up in the manufactured frenzy of memes. It's time to reevaluate our priorities and rediscover true enjoyment. And remember, bacon is meant to be enjoyed for its own sake, not as a symbol of hipness!”X¾   SHOCKING COLLAPSE! England's Innings Ends in Disaster!  In a stunning turn of events, England's batting lineup crumbled like a house of cards on the first day of the fourth test against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium. The scoreboard tells a tale of woe for the English team, as they were bowled out for a measly total of 180 runs.  The drama began right from the start, with Andrew Strauss being dismissed for a duck by the fiery Dale Steyn. The South African bowlers continued to torment the English batsmen, as Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott fell victim to Morne Morkel's lethal lbw deliveries.  Even the mighty Kevin Pietersen couldn't escape the clutches of the South African attack, as he was caught by Wayne Parnell off Morkel's bowling. The collapse continued with Paul Collingwood, Ian Bell, and Matt Prior all succumbing to the relentless pressure of the home team.  Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann tried to salvage the innings, but their efforts were in vain as they too fell victim to the skillful bowling of Steyn. Ryan Sidebottom and James Anderson could only muster a few runs before being dismissed, leaving England with a paltry total on the scoreboard.  South Africa's bowlers were undoubtedly the heroes of the day, with Steyn leading the pack with an impressive five-wicket haul. Morkel and Ryan McLaren also contributed to England's downfall, taking three and one wickets respectively.  The South African team now has the opportunity to capitalize on their opponent's dismal performance. Led by captain Graeme Smith, they will aim to take full advantage of their strong bowling attack and secure a commanding lead in the match.  The tension is palpable as the two teams prepare to battle it out in what promises to be an exhilarating test match. Will England be able to recover from their disastrous innings? Or will South Africa continue to dominate and secure victory? Only time will tell.

Zimbabwe's future hangs in the balance as President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai prepare for a high-stakes summit to settle their bitter feud. The tension between these two power players has reached a boiling point, threatening to tear apart the already fragile unity government.  Mugabe, accused by Tsvangirai of sabotaging their coalition, has agreed to attend the summit, vowing to give his side of the story. The prime minister, on the other hand, is adamant that this meeting is absolutely essential to address the severity of the situation. Tsvangirai shocked the nation on October 16th when he announced his boycott of the unity government, citing a surge in political violence and claiming that Mugabe treated him like a lowly subordinate.  In a dramatic turn of events, Tsvangirai's spokesperson, James Maridadi, revealed that Mozambique, Swaziland, and Zambia will come together in Maputo, Mozambique's capital, this Thursday to discuss the crisis. These leaders, who are key members of the Southern African Development Community, have been instrumental in pushing for Zimbabwe's power-sharing agreement. They were appalled by the violence that tarnished the country's elections and are determined to find a solution.  Mugabe, during a press conference on Monday, didn't explicitly mention the upcoming summit but hinted at briefing the regional leaders on the challenges they are facing. This statement came after a marathon four-hour meeting with President Joseph Kabila of Congo, who is currently serving as the chairman of the Southern African Development Community. Kabila is also expected to meet with Tsvangirai to further discuss the crisis.  The stakes couldn't be higher as the leaders gather to find a way forward. Mugabe, in his usual defiant manner, expects Kabila to tell Tsvangirai that he must face the problems head-on rather than running away. The tension between these political heavyweights is palpable, and the fate of Zimbabwe hangs in the balance.  Stay tuned for more updates on this sensational summit!

  SHOCKING REVELATION: U.S. House Supports Argentina's Quest for Justice!  In a jaw-dropping move, the U.S. House has unanimously passed a groundbreaking measure that could send shockwaves through the intelligence community! If this measure is approved by the U.S. Senate and President Barack Obama, American intelligence agencies will be forced to share their top-secret files on dictatorship-era human rights violations in Argentina.  The implications of this move are staggering! It could provide vital evidence for ongoing human rights trials in Argentina, and even help reunite over 400 families with children who were cruelly stolen at birth. These innocent children were ripped away from their mothers, who were kidnapped and brutally murdered by the heartless Argentine dictatorship. The truth is finally within reach!  Argentina's ambassador to the U.S., the honorable Hector Timerman, couldn't contain his gratitude. He exclaimed, "The affirmative vote of the Representatives is an important gesture of solidarity with all victims of the dictatorship in Argentina and a strong demonstration of a commitment to defend human rights by the American people and the institutions that represent them." What a powerful statement of support!  We mustn't forget the hero behind this measure, U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey. He has bravely taken on this noble cause before, successfully unearthing shocking CIA involvement in destabilizing the government of socialist President Salvador Allende in Chile. Now, he aims to do the same for Argentina. What a true champion for justice!  Joining the cause is the National Security Archive, a fearless nonprofit group in Washington. They are determined to expose government secrets using the Freedom of Information Act. Their relentless efforts have already resulted in over 200 FOIA requests to intelligence agencies for information on Argentina. Sadly, only a handful of responses have been positive. But the truth will prevail!  Carlos Osorio, a dedicated researcher with the National Security Archive, highlights the urgency of this matter. He asserts, "It was the duty of the CIA to keep on top of what this dictatorship was doing in the 1970s and 1980s. All this is relevant information, and it's exactly what the Argentine judges want." The truth is out there, and it's high time it sees the light of day!  Hold on tight, dear readers! The battle for justice and the pursuit of truth continues. With the backing of the U.S. House, Argentina's quest for answers takes a massive leap forward. Will the U.S. Senate and President Obama join this righteous cause? Only time will tell. Stay”XC
  SHOCKING OIL LEAK THREATENS TO DESTROY GULF OF MEXICO!  In a stunning turn of events, the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico is causing a political earthquake that could change everything! As Congress debates climate policy and gears up for the November elections, the devastating spill is forcing politicians to reevaluate their stance on energy issues. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, shocked the nation when he withdrew his support for offshore drilling on Tuesday. His decision followed a similar move by Florida Governor Charlie Crist, who expressed serious concerns about environmental safety.  But not everyone is jumping ship. Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, is standing firm in her support of continued drilling. This clash of opinions is highlighting the deep divide within the Republican party, which had previously championed expanded offshore oil and gas exploration.  The consequences of this catastrophe are far-reaching. Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS-Cambridge Energy Research Associates, called it a "major setback" for climate and energy policy. Everything is now at a standstill as the oil continues to pour into the Gulf. The disaster began on April 20 with an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon, a drilling rig owned by Transocean and leased by BP. The rig sank just two days later, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.  The oil spill is now rapidly approaching the Louisiana coast, putting the livelihoods of fishermen, shrimpers, and oystermen in grave danger. BP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward met with Obama administration officials to discuss how to handle the crisis. The meeting was described as "constructive," but the gravity of the situation cannot be ignored.  BP has taken responsibility for the disaster and is working alongside the government to clean up the spill. Engineers are frantically trying to cap the leak, but progress is slow. At least three committees in Congress are planning hearings to investigate the spill, which is sure to be a dramatic showdown.  This disaster has thrown a wrench into President Obama's plans as well. Just a month ago, he agreed to open new areas for drilling in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, hoping to gain Republican support for a climate bill. But with this spill, any hope of a deal is slipping away.  Experts are comparing this catastrophe to the infamous 1969 oil spill off the California coast, known as the Santa Barbara oil spill. That disaster led to a dramatic shift in environmental policy and was the catalyst for the very first Earth Day. The impact of”X5	  "Oprah's Final Season Kicks off with Mind-Blowing Surprises!"  In a shocking turn of events, Oprah Winfrey revealed on Monday that her last season as the reigning Queen of Daytime would be filled with heart-stopping surprises. But hold onto your seats, because she did NOT drop the bombshell that she was actually staying on as the host of her talk show instead of focusing on her Oprah Winfrey Network co-venture with Discovery. Sorry folks, that was just wishful thinking!  Instead, on the first episode of her farewell season, Oprah stunned her loyal fans by announcing that she would be taking her entire 300-strong studio audience of die-hard "Oprah" superfans on an unforgettable eight-day trip to Sydney in December. Was this announcement a ploy to ensure a warm welcome when she tapes a couple of episodes Down Under? We can only speculate!  But wait, there's more! Another heart-pounding surprise left the audience breathless. It could have been none other than John Travolta himself, who made a jaw-dropping appearance at the start of the show. The Oprah Uber Fans went wild, leaping to their feet, screaming, and clutching their hearts in amazement. Travolta, voted the show's all-time favorite guest with 11 appearances, couldn't contain his adoration for Oprah. "There's only one of you, Oprah, and there will never be another," he gushed. Oh, the feels!  In case you didn't know, Travolta is also a pilot with Qantas, one of the sponsors funding the Sydney trip. It seems like Oprah knows how to make dreams come true!  But the surprises didn't stop there. Six lucky fans from Boston, sent by Oprah's BFF Gayle King, embarked on a road trip to Chicago to attend the season debut. Little did they know, they were in for a shock when they were tricked into driving right onto the stage, believing the debut was scheduled for the next day. Cue the fashion emergency as one of the Boston Oprah diehards exclaimed, "This isn't what I was going to wear!" Talk about unexpected twists!  And let's not forget the unexpected walk-on by none other than Don Johnson himself. Oprah was reminiscing about her failed attempt to book the then-superstar of "Miami Vice" on her very first episode. To her surprise, Johnson made an appearance, reminding everyone of the vast difference in their career trajectories. Oprah's reaction? Pure shock and disbelief. "”X½
  Shocking Parliament Rejection Delays Afghan Government Formation!  In a shocking turn of events, President Hamid Karzai's Cabinet nominees have been majorly rejected by the parliament, leaving the establishment of a functioning government in shambles. The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, expressed his surprise at the parliament's decision to reject 17 out of Karzai's 24 picks. This setback will undoubtedly delay the government's ability to focus on much-needed reforms and partner with donor nations.  This unexpected rejection means that Karzai will now have to spend precious time submitting new Cabinet nominees, pushing back the government's ability to fully cooperate with international allies before the upcoming conference in London. The parliament's 10-hour voting session resulted in the rejection of nominees seen as Karzai's political buddies, those believed to be under the influence of warlords, and those deemed unfit for the positions.  While the president managed to retain some key portfolios, such as defense, interior, and finance, this rejection is undoubtedly a blow to his authority. Eide expressed his disappointment, calling it a setback and a distraction. Even Karzai's spokesman, Waheed Omar, admitted that the situation is far from ideal, affecting the government's ability to provide services effectively. However, he emphasized that all ministries are still functioning, with deputies carrying out their duties in some cases.  Former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah, who ran against Karzai in the fraud-ridden presidential election last year, believes that this rejection of Cabinet nominees will have repercussions at the upcoming international conference. He stated that Karzai's legitimacy was already in question due to the election controversy, and this rejection only adds fuel to the fire.  Although Karzai plans to submit new nominations to fill the empty ministerial posts, the timeline for this remains uncertain. Eide predicts that it could take weeks, or even longer, before the parliament approves a new government. This delay raises concerns about the stability and effectiveness of the Afghan government during such a critical time.  As Eide prepares to step down from his role as the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan, he expressed his concern over the deployment of 37,000 additional foreign troops. He believes that this increased military involvement could hinder efforts to strengthen political and civilian institutions, which are crucial in the ongoing war. Eide emphasized the need for a sustained, long-term focus on building up civilian institutions and the Afghan economy.  In addition to these concerns, Eide called for electoral reforms to be implemented before”X\
  SHOCKING! President Obama VOWS to Prosecute Those Responsible for Gulf Oil Spill Disaster!  President Barack Obama is not messing around when it comes to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. In a powerful statement, the President declared that anyone who broke the law in relation to this catastrophic event will face the consequences. He even sent his trusted Attorney General, Eric Holder, to the Gulf to get to the bottom of things.  Obama made these bold statements in the breathtaking Rose Garden of the White House, right after meeting with Bob Graham and William K. Reilly, two heavyweights leading an independent commission investigating the spill. The President gave them strict orders to follow the facts, no matter where they lead, and to do so fearlessly.  But that's not all! Attorney General Eric Holder wasted no time in taking action. He revealed that federal authorities have already launched criminal and civil investigations into the massive oil leakage that has plagued the Gulf. Holder joined forces with the attorneys general of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, as well as several U.S. attorneys, to fight for justice.  The Justice Department is leaving no stone unturned. They have even warned BP PLC, the company responsible for the destroyed oil rig, not to destroy any documents that could be crucial to the investigation. They are determined to find out if anyone broke the law and caused this horrific disaster.  President Obama is standing strong, promising that those responsible will be held accountable. He made a solemn pledge to the victims and the people of the Gulf region that justice will be served. If the existing laws are not enough to prevent such a catastrophe in the future, Obama is ready to change them. If the oversight was lacking, he is prepared to reform it.  The President's determination is evident as he met with Graham and Reilly, and as Holder made his way to the Gulf Coast. The timing is crucial, coming just days after BP's latest attempt to stop the oil flow failed miserably. Obama even held a rare news conference at the White House to address the situation and personally visited Louisiana to assess the damage.  The administration is taking control of the situation and distancing itself from BP, but not without walking a fine line. They still need BP's expertise to fix the runaway oil well. However, they are not shying away from responsibility and are fully aware of the political risks involved.  To show their newfound authority, the administration has put an end to joint news conferences with Coast Guard and BP officials. They want to handle this crisis on their own terms. Adm. Thad”XT
  SHOCKING VIOLENCE ERUPTS IN IRAN - OPPOSITION LEADER'S NEPHEW AMONG THE DEAD!  Iran was plunged into chaos on Sunday as security forces clashed with anti-government protesters in a bloody battle. The death toll includes the nephew of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, adding fuel to the fire of this explosive situation.  Witnesses and opposition websites reported that at least four people were killed during the fierce clashes, including Mousavi's 35-year-old nephew, Ali Mousavi. The heart-wrenching video footage captured an enraged crowd carrying away one of the casualties while chanting vengefully, "I'll kill, I'll kill the one who killed my brother."  The protests, which began in the center of Tehran, quickly escalated as demonstrators fought back against the security forces with a furious vengeance. They hurled stones and set motorcycles, cars, and vans ablaze, creating a scene straight out of a Hollywood action movie.  But the unrest wasn't confined to Tehran alone. Demonstrations also erupted in three other cities, spreading the chaos like wildfire. The violence escalated to such an extent that even police officers were injured, with one photographed with blood streaming down his face after being attacked by the crowd in a blazing street.  The protesters were undeterred by official warnings of a harsh crackdown, as they took to the streets on a religious observance day. Iranians were observing Ashoura, a day that commemorates the death of one of Shiite Islam's cherished saints. Chanting "Death to the dictator," opposition supporters defied the warnings, unleashing their anger and frustration.  Security forces attempted to disperse the protesters with tear gas, batons, and warning shots, but their efforts were in vain. In a shocking turn of events, they resorted to opening fire directly at the protesters, leaving a trail of death and devastation in their wake.  The clashes were brutal, resulting in the bloodiest confrontation between protesters and security forces since the aftermath of the disputed June election. Opposition supporters sustained severe injuries, with witnesses reporting broken limbs from brutal beatings. The brutality of the situation was not limited to Tehran, as violent confrontations also erupted in Isfahan, Najafabad, and Shiraz.  The opposition insists that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stole the election through massive vote fraud, claiming that Mousavi was the rightful winner. The anger and frustration among the Iranian people continue to simmer, exploding into these violent clashes.

The Droid X boasts a massive 4.3-inch screen, making it one of the largest smartphones on the market. It's even bigger than its predecessor, the original Droid, and dwarfing the iPhone's puny 3.5-inch display. Despite its size, the Droid X is surprisingly slim and lightweight, making it a comfortable fit for those with big hands.  Motorola made some smart design choices to achieve this sleekness. They ditched the physical keyboard in favor of an onscreen one, which takes full advantage of the spacious display. And boy, is it a pleasure to use in landscape mode!  Running on Google's Android operating system, the Droid X is a force to be reckoned with. With a claimed 70,000 apps available, it's catching up to the iPhone's app store.

Motorola also brings its MotoBlur software to the table, allowing users to blend content from various social networking sites into one seamless stream. It's a nifty feature that doesn't overwhelm like it did on the Motorola Cliq.  In a direct comparison with the iPhone 4, the Droid X comes out on top in terms of storage. With a whopping 24 gigabytes, it outshines the iPhone's 16 gigabytes. And if that's not enough, you can expand the Droid X's capacity to a jaw-dropping 40 gigabytes.  So, will the Droid X dethrone the iPhone 4? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure - this battle of the giants is going to be epic!

In a jaw-dropping mix-up that could change the fate of a multibillion-dollar contract, the Air Force mistakenly handed over confidential information to rival companies Boeing and Airbus. This major blunder has put the intense competition for the $35 billion contract to build 179 new Air Force tankers in jeopardy.  The shocking mix-up occurred when Boeing received detailed proprietary information about Airbus' bid, while Airbus parent company EADS got their hands on Boeing's bid. This clerical error, described by Air Force spokesman Col. Les Kodlick as involving a "limited amount of source selection information," has the potential to completely alter the outcome of this high-stakes competition.  While Kodlick refused to provide specifics about the transmitted data, it is believed that the information included crucial pricing details on the competing bids. This could have a significant impact on the final bid proposals from both companies, as pricing has been a hotly debated issue throughout the competition.  The Air Force had been expected to award the contract before the end of the year, but now it has been pushed back to early next year. However, Kodlick claims that this delay is unrelated to the disclosure of proprietary data. The Air Force is currently investigating how this shocking breach occurred and is taking steps to ensure it never happens again.  Senators Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray expressed their outrage at the Air Force's mishandling of this sensitive information. Cantwell called it "inexcusable," while Murray expressed her concerns about the further delay of the contract, which has already been postponed to allow an illegally subsidized company to compete.  Boeing, currently feeling the heat, has not yet responded to requests for comment. The Air Force has been desperately trying to replace its outdated KC-135 refueling tankers, which have been in service since the 1950s. Since 2003, they have been searching for the perfect company to take on this crucial task, and this shocking blunder has thrown the entire competition into chaos. Stay tuned for more updates on this scandalous saga!”X¾	  EXCLUSIVE: UN Climate Chief Calls Out Corporate Bigwigs for Slacking Off on Climate Change Fight!  It's a battle that affects every single person on this planet, yet some of the world's biggest corporations are apparently too busy sipping champagne to join the fight against climate change! The United Nations climate chief, Yvo de Boer, had some strong words for executives from Coca-Cola and Unilever, among others, urging them to step up and take on a more serious role in this global crisis.  At a meeting of corporate CEOs, de Boer didn't hold back, telling these big-shot businessmen that they were basically doing nothing to contribute to the fight against climate change. "You're not playing any role in a serious way," de Boer declared, calling out their lack of involvement in the international climate change discussion. Ouch!  But de Boer wasn't done there. He threw down the gauntlet, challenging these corporate leaders to "make yourself relevant" at the upcoming U.N. climate conference. This conference is where negotiators from an incredible 192 countries are working tirelessly to hammer out the details of a global warming pact. And guess what? These CEOs are nowhere to be found!  De Boer accused them of doing a great job at the national level, but failing to make connections on the international stage. Talk about dropping the ball! It's time for these executives to step up and make a real difference in the fight against climate change.  But not all hope is lost. Some of the CEOs present at the Copenhagen Business Day meeting seemed to have a change of heart. They finally realized that they need to change the way they do business to adapt to a low-carbon economy. About time!  Bruno Lafont, the CEO of Lafarge SA, the largest cement maker in the world, acknowledged that markets and consumers are demanding new solutions. Ditlev Engel, the CEO of wind turbine maker Vestas, echoed this sentiment, saying, "It's now we have to change our businesses to become sustainable. The only question is at what speed we can do it."  During a panel discussion, Malini Mehra, head of the Center for Social Markets, didn't hold back either. She urged these 21 executives to get out there and raise their voices. "Shout at your governments! Get the NGOs on your side!" she exclaimed. She also pointed out the absence of CEOs from the developing world at the conference, challenging these executives to reach out and make connections with their counterparts in those countries.

  Lawmakers on the Verge of Major Victory for Auto Dealers, Stumping Obama and Advocates!  In a shocking turn of events, the nation's 18,000 auto dealers may soon be exempt from the clutches of a new consumer financial watchdog. This move, which is sending shockwaves through the political landscape, is a massive win for industry lobbyists and a massive blow to President Barack Obama, Democratic leaders, consumer advocates, and even Pentagon officials, who all opposed this loophole.   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the House-Senate Conference Committee, is causing quite a stir by proposing to include the auto-dealer exemption in the final bill, despite his own opposition to it. Frank claims that he is bound by the House, which overwhelmingly supported the exemption last fall.   But hold the presses, folks! The Senate isn't backing down without a fight. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who also opposed the exemption, has proposed a compromise that could still keep auto dealers under the new watchdog's rules. Under Dodd's proposal, auto dealers would technically be exempt from the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, but wait for it... the bureau would still have the power to write new truth-in-lending rules that could apply to auto dealers. The Federal Reserve could choose to ignore these rules, but they would have to explain themselves. The Federal Trade Commission would also have the authority to adopt aggressive new rules governing dealer-assisted financing. It's a wild, wild compromise, folks!  While the details are still up in the air, it seems almost certain that auto dealers will escape direct supervision by the new consumer bureau. However, firms like GMAC that provide direct auto financing won't be so lucky - they'll still be under the watchdog's watchful eye.   But wait, there's more! In a stunning twist, the Obama administration and consumer advocates managed to secure a victory that once seemed uncertain. House and Senate negotiators have come to an agreement on the shape of the new consumer protection regulator, which will operate as a bureau within the Federal Reserve. This regulator will have almost total autonomy, including independent funding, a presidentially appointed head, and the power to write and enforce rules. It's a major win for those fighting for consumer rights!  While auto dealers are celebrating their potential escape from regulation, they remain cautious about the Senate proposal. Bailey Wood, the National Automobile Dealers Association spokesman, had this to say: 'We've definitely made strides forward in the process, but the fight is far”X_	  "Shocking Secrets Behind Lucrative Pentagon Contracts Revealed!  The Pentagon is embroiled in a scandalous bidding war for a jaw-dropping $100 million jet fuel contract! But that's not all - brace yourselves for the explosive news that they're opening another lucrative contract, this time for fuel delivery to the war-torn Bagram air base in Afghanistan!  Both bases play a vital role in the Afghanistan war effort, highlighting the logistical nightmare faced by the military in this landlocked country. The proposed contract for Bagram demands fuel to be brought in via safer northern routes, unlike the hazardous southern route that is constantly under attack by militants. This means fuel will have to be transported from refineries in Russia, Azerbaijan, Greece, and other countries over treacherous seas and then overland to these bases.  Hold onto your hats, folks, because the shady corporations holding the current contracts are hiding in the shadows! Red Star Enterprises has held the Bagram contract since 2007, while Mina has been handling the Manas supply since 2005. Who are the mysterious owners of these corporations? That remains a national secret, but they conveniently share offices in Gibraltar and London. To add to the intrigue, their operations director, Charles Squires, is a former U.S. military attachÃ© in Kyrgyzstan.  But wait, there's more scandalous drama! The Manas contract has caused a political firestorm in Kyrgyzstan, toppling two presidents amid allegations of corruption linked to fuel deliveries. The new Kyrgyz government is now scheming to create a national fuel company, potentially cutting out the middlemen. Negotiations between the Kyrgyz government and State Department officials are already underway, raising suspicions of a power struggle.  As if this wasn't scandalous enough, Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins, a Pentagon spokesperson, claims there will be a "full and open competitive basis" for the Bagram contract. However, other potential bidders are crying foul, pointing out that Red Star's secret pipeline gives them an unfair advantage. But Robbins denies any wrongdoing, stating that the pipeline and northern truck deliveries will both remain intact.  The tension is mounting, and the secrets are unraveling in this high-stakes bidding war. Who will emerge victorious and claim these jaw-dropping contracts? Stay tuned for more shocking updates!"”Xó   A Hollywood Star Embraces a Bold New Direction  In an era where many actors seem content to prioritize financial gain over artistic integrity, one performer is boldly defying the norm. Jeff Bridges, renowned for his iconic role in "The Big Lebowski," recently made headlines with a surprising announcement: he will now exclusively take on nude scenes. This decision marks a significant shift in Bridges' career, as he leaves his clothed roles firmly in the past.  In a candid interview with GQ magazine, Bridges expressed his eagerness to embark on this new phase. "I've been there and I've done that," he explained, recounting a lengthy repertoire of films where he appeared fully clothed. "Now, I can finally afford to only take on roles that excite me. Right now, those are roles with nude scenes. Why waste my time with anything else?"  Bridges' commitment to his principles is commendable. While he emphasized that he harbors no regrets about his previous non-nude roles, he candidly acknowledged the pressures he faced from directors and studios to remain clothed on camera. "No more towels; no more bathrobes; no more carefully placed plants," he declared. "Even if my character isn't written as nude, any director I work with will have to figure out how to make him that way. It'll be a challenge for both of us, and one I can't wait to tackle."  The response from Bridges' devoted fanbase has been overwhelmingly supportive. Messages of admiration flooded social media, with one fan exclaiming, "Wow! Whether or not you agree with him, you've got to have respect for a Hollywood star with that much conviction. You keep doing you, Jeff!"  Bridges' decision to embrace nudity as a creative choice is undeniably powerful. In an industry often driven by commercial interests, his unwavering commitment to his craft sets him apart. As he ventures into this new chapter, audiences can anticipate thought-provoking performances that challenge both the actor and the director, all while pushing the boundaries of artistic expression.”X>  In what football insiders are deeming an unexpectedly severe penalty, the National Football League has imposed a sentence of Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, to spend a year with the New York Jets as a consequence of his involvement in the infamous Deflategate scandal. This punishment has sparked an outcry from Patriots fans and management, who argue that it is the harshest penalty in the history of the league. However, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell defended the decision, asserting its necessity as a deterrent. Goodell stated, "We must convey the message that this league has a zero tolerance policy for cheating." He believes that a year of serving as the Jets' quarterback will effectively communicate this message.   Upon receiving news of his punishment, Brady was reportedly in a state of disbelief. He later held a press conference, hastily organized, during which he appeared close to tears on multiple occasions. Brady vehemently opposed the decision, vowing to fight it with every fiber of his being. He asserted, "This is America. You cannot compel an individual to play for the Jets."  At a sports bar in Manhattan, the response to the imminent arrival of the Jets' long-standing adversary was subdued. A Jets fan expressed, "Look, Brady may not be well-liked, but even he did not deserve this treatment."”Xû  Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Matthew Dellavedova suffered multiple fractures in a horrifying incident that occurred after Game 3 of the N.B.A. Finals. Despite this devastating setback, Dellavedova remains determined to take the court for Game 4 on Thursday. Speaking from the intensive-care unit at the esteemed Cleveland Clinic, the resilient Australian declined to delve into the specifics of the accident but affirmed that the loss of his limbs and neck would not hinder his participation in the upcoming contest.  "I refuse to give anything less than a hundred percent, even if I am playing without a spinal column," Dellavedova declared, candidly acknowledging that he had also fractured his spinal column. His unwavering commitment to the team's cause is truly remarkable.  Cleveland coach David Blatt was full of praise for Dellavedova, describing him as the epitome of a blue-collar worker â€“ a lunch-pail smokestack guy who won't allow a full body cast to impede his performance. Blatt expressed his confidence in Dellavedova's ability to deliver yet another valiant display in Game 4, citing the point guard's past experiences playing with a detached head during his college years.  The Cavaliers, still reeling from the loss of their star player, LeBron James, who suffered a broken ankle in Game 2, will undoubtedly rely heavily on Dellavedova's unwavering determination and tenacity. As the team braces itself for a pivotal Game 4, Dellavedova's resilience serves as an inspiration to his teammates and fans alike.”•i     X¯  North Korea's official news agency, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), made a surprising announcement today, revealing that the country's military had decided to postpone a planned missile test due to complications with the operating system, Windows 8. This revelation provides a rare glimpse into the inner workings of North Korea's missile program, which, astonishingly, had been operating on the outdated Windows 95 until last year.  The KCNA statement, while lacking a specific rescheduled date for the missile test, did mention that the agency was actively collaborating with Windows 8 support to resolve the issue. However, intelligence analysts believe this vague statement implies an indefinite delay. According to one analyst, this delay suggests that the missile test may not occur anytime soon, if ever.  Insiders close to the North Korean regime have reported that Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un is seething with anger over the Windows 8 problems. They claim that he is contemplating various options, including the radical step of declaring war on Microsoft.  These surprising developments shed light on the extent of North Korea's reliance on outdated technology and their struggles in modernizing their missile program. It also highlights the regime's frustration with the American tech giant, Microsoft, which they hold responsible for the delay.  The use of Windows 95 in North Korea's missile program until recently is a concerning revelation, considering the system was released over two decades ago. It raises questions about the country's technological capabilities and their ability to keep up with international standards.  Furthermore, the fact that the Supreme Leader is reportedly considering declaring war on Microsoft underscores the regime's desperation and their need for a scapegoat. It is an alarming indication of the lengths they are willing to go to deflect blame and maintain a facade of strength.  As North Korea's missile program remains a subject of international concern, these recent events hint at the internal challenges the regime is facing. The delay caused by Windows 8 issues serves as a reminder that even seemingly powerful entities can be hindered by technological setbacks.”XÝ  In a recent poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Opinion Research Institute, it has become apparent that the 2016 Republican field is in dire need of an injection of dignity. Interestingly, the poll reveals that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin possesses the ability to articulate her positions on various issues with precision and restraint, a skill that seems to be lacking among the other contenders. Moreover, voters have expressed their belief that Palin's extensive knowledge in the realms of economics, foreign affairs, and American history would position her far ahead of the current crop of Republican hopefuls. One participant in the survey eloquently stated, "When I hear some of these candidates talk, I sure do miss Sarah Palin."   Despite the widespread perception that Palin would bring much-needed gravitas and intellectual rigor to the G.O.P. contest, her candidacy seems improbable, according to a spokesman. The governor, though flattered by the poll results, is apprehensive about being associated with the current field of candidates, fearing that it could diminish her standing.   In unrelated news, artist Shantell Martin's unique talent for drawing on people, airplanes, and clothing has attracted attention.”X/  With the highly anticipated Presidential debate just two days away, Republican nominee Mitt Romney has been dedicating himself to improving two crucial skills that have evaded him throughout his campaign: articulation and critical thinking. According to a close aide, a significant portion of Romney's debate preparation has involved practicing a series of preplanned one-liners, yielding mixed results. One particular line about the budget deficit, which was deemed foolproof, somehow turned into an insensitive comment about gay Mexicans. Apparently, Romney's practice debates have not gone as well as anticipated, as the former Massachusetts governor has faced resounding defeat against various opponents, including the Apple personal assistant Siri.  During a joint campaign appearance in Ohio, Ann Romney attempted to manage expectations for her husband's performance in Wednesday's debate, urging listeners to disregard his meandering tangents. She humorously remarked that she has survived all these years by tuning him out when he goes off on bizarre tangents. Romney himself also downplayed his prospects in the upcoming debate, humbly acknowledging that President Obama might just be the greatest debater in human history. He compared Obama to the likes of Abraham Lincoln, Clarence Darrow, and the Roman orator Cicero, suggesting that standing next to such a silver-tongued individual would make him sound like someone suffering from a head injury.  Following Romney's statement, his campaign promptly released an apology to individuals who have experienced head injuries.”XÙ   Meet Ricky Davis, a 26-year-old basketball enthusiast who takes fandom to a whole new level. Growing up in the 90s, Ricky developed an unyielding passion for And1 apparel, so much so that he embarked on a remarkable journey, spending over $100,000 on a series of plastic surgeries to transform himself into the iconic And1 guy. The results? Simply breathtaking.  This arduous undertaking spanned more than two years, during which Ricky underwent 13 agonizing surgeries to turn his dream into reality. The process commenced with doctors tinting Ricky's skin gray and utilizing cutting-edge lasers to obliterate every single hair follicle on his body. But that was just the beginning of this astonishing metamorphosis. Ricky went as far as having a regulation-size basketball implanted into his palm, a testament to his unwavering dedication.  In a groundbreaking experimental procedure, Ricky's face was reconstructed using skin grafts from his buttocks, effectively concealing his eyes, nose, and mouth. Remarkably, through the generosity of organ donors, doctors were able to procure sufficient muscle to enhance Ricky's torso, arms, and legs. This intricate and transformative journey took a staggering 26 months and cost Ricky a total of $104,365. The commitment displayed by Ricky throughout this endeavor is truly remarkable.  Fortunately, Ricky's unwavering devotion did not go unnoticed. And1, after catching a glimpse of a photograph showcasing their number one fan's transformation, took to Twitter to express their amazement and admiration. It is undoubtedly a dream come true for any 90s kid.   Though Ricky faces a rigorous physical therapy regimen, ranging from eight months to a year, before he can walk again, it is only a matter of time before he graces the basketball court, wowing spectators in true And1 fashion. If Ricky could speak, there is no doubt he would proclaim that the entire journey was unequivocally worthwhile. Congratulations, Ricky, you are undeniably the ultimate And1 fan!”X  In the wake of the United States Supreme Court's historic decisions this week, the Republican Party is facing a daunting task of finding new issues to rally behind for the upcoming 2016 campaign. With gay marriage and Obamacare effectively removed from their arsenal, Republicans are now left without a signature phony issue to exploit in the next sixteen months. However, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, reassures the party faithful that they are diligently searching for fresh spurious positions to distract voters during the upcoming campaign.  Priebus outlined a list of potential issues that the Party is considering, including a twenty-foot border fence, national voter I.D. cards, abolition of the I.R.S., and mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds. "Back at R.N.C. headquarters, we've got a wall of three-by-five cards filled with ideas like that," he proudly shared. Priebus admitted that losing Obamacare and gay marriage as issues was a significant setback for the G.O.P.'s supply of meaningless talking points, but he confidently asserted that the Party would come back stronger with even more insincere rhetoric than before. "Anyone who thinks we've run out of b.s. is sorely mistaken," he declared.  The loss of these issues has left Republicans scrambling to find new ways to energize their base and attract voters. The Supreme Court's decisions have forced them to reconsider their campaign strategy and find alternative avenues to appeal to their constituents. Priebus's remarks demonstrate the Party's determination to adapt and forge ahead, despite the challenges they currently face.  In the coming months, Republicans will be under pressure to reinvent themselves and present a compelling platform to voters. The party's ability to find new issues and craft persuasive arguments will shape the dynamics of the 2016 campaign. As the Republicans regroup and strategize, the nation will be watching to see how they overcome this setback and redefine their priorities in the pursuit of electoral success.”X–  Koch Industries, the conglomerate led by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, is staunchly defending its recent acquisition of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker amid accusations of overpayment. Co-owner David Koch's revelation that Walker has essentially become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company has ignited a wave of criticism, with detractors claiming that Koch Industries spent an exorbitant amount on an essentially valueless asset. Experts well-versed in the political market have pointed out that there was no competitive bidding for Walker, and not even casino magnate Sheldon Adelson expressed any interest in acquiring him.  Although the specific purchase price remains undisclosed, Koch Industries has announced plans to allocate a staggering $900 million towards various enhancements for the Wisconsin governor by November 2016. In a brief statement, the company defended its investment, asserting that Scott Walker seamlessly aligns with its diverse portfolio of elected officials. However, the statement also hinted at the possibility of divesting Walker if he fails to meet expectations, leaving the door open for a potential sale at a later date.”XÓ  Republican lawmakers held another day of hearings today, with Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California) leading the charge in investigating Hillary Clinton's suspiciously high poll numbers and strategizing ways to lower them. Despite months of relentless attacks on Clinton by Fox News and the Republican party, her popularity has only soared, leaving Issa and his committee puzzled.  Recent polls have shown Clinton outperforming every potential GOP presidential candidate, including a slimmer version of Chris Christie. This baffling phenomenon has prompted Issa to demand answers. "What does Secretary Clinton know that none of us know?" he questioned, emphasizing the committee's need to understand how Clinton managed to maintain her popularity and prevent it from recurring in the future.  In a bold allegation, Issa accused Clinton of cynically leveraging her position as Secretary of State to gain favor with the American people. He called upon Clinton to address these charges during the hearings. As the day's proceedings came to an end, Issa warned Clinton that this was just the beginning of their investigation. He made it clear that once Republicans set their sights on someone, they do not relent, encouraging Clinton to consult her husband, former President Bill Clinton, for confirmation.  Note: The New York Times style is known for its formal and objective tone. The original article contained biased language and personal attacks, which have been removed in the rewritten version.”XÆ  In a recent poll conducted on Tuesday night, an overwhelming majority of Americans expressed a newfound belief in their potential to be elected to the esteemed United States Senate. The survey findings shed light on a resurgent perception of inclusivity within the American political landscape, with respondents emphasizing that anyone, regardless of intellectual prowess, eloquence, or any other qualifications, could serve in the Senate. This shift in sentiment indicates a notable surge in enthusiasm among Americans concerning their prospective careers in the heart of Washington, at least as of Tuesday night.  However, not all of the poll's findings were as encouraging. A significant nineteen percent of participants claimed their inability to respond to the survey due to their lingering state of shock. Additionally, a troubling fourteen percent concurred with the statement "WTF???" â€“ a reflection of the mixed reactions elicited by the poll's inquiries.”X‡  New Poll Shows Widespread Support for U.S. Air Strikes in Syria Among Uninformed Americans  In a promising turn of events for the U.S.-led air strike campaign in Syria, a recent poll reveals strong and broad-based support among individuals who have yet to read a single news article about the conflict. The findings, released on Tuesday, indicate that the bombing campaign received overwhelming approval from those who lacked any information about the duration of Syria's civil war, the parties involved, or even the definition of a Sunni. Furthermore, the air strikes garnered enthusiastic backing from individuals who were unable to correctly identify the President of Syria, comprehend the meaning behind the acronym ISIS, or locate Syria on a map.  Davis Logsdon, the pollster in charge of the survey for the University of Minnesota's Opinion Research Institute, believes these poll numbers bode well for the mission's future. "People who have not read a single article about Syria make up a significant portion of the American population," he stated. "Their overwhelming support is crucial, especially considering their firm refusal to read any articles about Syria in the future."  According to Logsdon, the air strike campaign also received high marks from another important group: Americans who may have glanced at a news headline about Syria but chose not to click on it. This group's positive response further strengthens the case for the mission's success.  As the U.S. continues its air strikes in Syria, this widespread support from uninformed individuals and those who briefly skim headlines offers a boost of confidence for the campaign's future endeavors.”XR   In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, Wayne LaPierre, the CEO of the National Rifle Association (N.R.A.), adamantly declared that the organization would vehemently oppose any legislation that seeks to restrict the sale, purchase, or ownership of politicians. Mr. LaPierre, who boasts a personal collection of over two hundred politicians, contended that politicians pose no threat to the public if handled responsibly. While the public often hears about the unscrupulous individuals in Congress, Mr. LaPierre argued that the only effective countermeasure against a corrupt politician is a virtuous one. "I take great pride in being the proprietor of many of these honorable individuals," he proudly stated.  However, Mr. LaPierre's remarks instantly drew a sharp rebuke from Carol Foyler, a prominent advocate for stricter regulations on the sale of politicians. For the past twelve years, Foyler has tirelessly lobbied for tighter controls to prevent individuals like Wayne LaPierre from easily acquiring politicians. "At this moment, Wayne LaPierre can simply walk into Congress and buy any politician he desires," Foyler asserted. She pointed out the absence of background checks and waiting periods, which she argued has allowed numerous unstable and potentially dangerous individuals to acquire political power. Foyler also called for a reassessment of the excessive number of politicians in the United States, suggesting that reducing their quantity would contribute to a safer society.  In response, the NRA leader concluded his testimony by issuing a stern warning that he would fiercely resist any attempts to separate him from the hundreds of elected officials he legally claims as his own. To emphasize his point, Mr. LaPierre tightly clutched Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to his chest and passionately declared, "From my cold, dead hands."”Xç  In anticipation of his upcoming State of the Union address, President Barack Obama shared his sentiments about the occasion with NBC's Matt Lauer. Reflecting on his final opportunity to address Congress, the President admitted, "I'm celebrating, just celebrating the last time I ever have to talk to these bastards." In an interview taped for NBC's Today show, Obama highlighted his plan to discuss the accomplishments of the past seven years and outline the challenges that lie ahead for the nation. However, he confided, "Inside, I'll be like, Good Lord, I never have to so much as look at these horrible people again."  When asked which member of Congress he would most enjoy never having to encounter again, Obama pondered the question. "That's tough," he replied. "It's a toss-up between Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell. But the beautiful thing is, I don't have to choose, Matt. After tonight, I don't have to look at either of them." Lauer reminded Obama that he might still have to engage in face-to-face conversations with McConnell during his final year as President. The President visibly shuddered at the thought and responded, "God, let's hope not."  Overall, Obama expressed modest ambitions for his final State of the Union address. "Just to be able to look out at that sea of bastards for the last time ever... well, it doesn't get sweeter than that," he declared. In an unrelated matter, five esteemed experts will participate in a spirited debate on a subject that has puzzled minds for centuries.”Xc  In the wake of Scotland's decision to remain part of the United Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth II took to the airwaves on Friday morning to deliver a gracious and heartfelt message to the Scottish people. In her televised address, the Queen acknowledged that while the issue of independence had been resolved, a lingering question remained. With dignity and magnanimity, she declared her forgiveness.  Addressing the nation, Queen Elizabeth II made only a passing reference to her passionate outburst the previous day, in which she expressed her disappointment at the mere idea of Scotland severing ties with the United Kingdom. Comparing her reaction to that of a frustrated parent, she assured the Scottish people that she forgave them for provoking her.  Concluding her address, the Queen struck a conciliatory tone, urging all citizens to come together as one united nation. She emphasized the shared benefits and rich history of the historic union, encouraging even those who had supported independence to join in moving forward. In a display of her regal grace, she extended her forgiveness to all, including those who had disagreed with her, encapsulating the sentiment with a touch of colloquialism.  As the Scottish people reflect on the outcome of the referendum, the Queen's words serve as a reminder of the importance of unity and forgiveness in building a cohesive nation.”X	  Shortly after world powers successfully negotiated a nuclear-framework agreement with Iran, Senator John McCain issued a stark warning about the potential consequences for future military actions against the Middle Eastern nation. President Obama has been praising the framework as a means to foster peace in the volatile region, but McCain expressed concern that such a deal could severely impede our ability to carry out bombing campaigns against Iran.  Speaking to reporters at the United States Senate, McCain lamented the potential loss of the opportunity to bomb Iran, a desire he has held for quite some time. He emphasized that if Iran were to comply fully with the nuclear program restrictions outlined in the agreement, our chances of bombing the country would be diminished significantly. He shook his head ruefully, calling it a "doomsday scenario."  McCain also criticized President Obama's priorities, suggesting that the President prioritizes appeasing the Iranians over satisfying those who wish to bomb them. As the deadline for finalizing a nuclear treaty with Iran looms on June 30th, McCain acknowledged that there is still a possibility that the talks could break down, offering a glimmer of hope for those who advocate for military action. However, he tempered expectations, stating that he is not getting his hopes up.  The Senator concluded his remarks by cautioning that if July 1st arrives and the United States finds itself at peace with Iran, he should not be blamed for failing to warn of the potential consequences.”X¡	  Harrison Ford Narrowly Escapes Catastrophic Accident at Office Supply Manufacturing Facility  In a harrowing turn of events, renowned actor Harrison Ford miraculously survived being compressed into a cube on a conveyor belt at an office supply manufacturing facility. Representatives of the 73-year-old Blade Runner star have confirmed that he is currently recovering from the terrifying incident.  Preliminary reports suggest that Ford, lured by the aroma of what he believed to be pie, entered the facility yesterday afternoon. Tragically, he slipped and fell onto the conveyor belt system, nearly facing complete obliteration alongside a load of factory waste.  The sequence of events that unfolded is nothing short of a Hollywood-worthy action scene. Ford skillfully maneuvered past large spike rollers and rapidly rotating gears, displaying incredible agility. With a stroke of luck, he managed to grab hold of a hanging catwalk platform, narrowly escaping the scorching blaze of two industrial blowtorches. Dodging the conveyor's cleaver chopping mechanism, Ford's body was then violently catapulted into the facility's baler, where he underwent a series of brutal transformations - flattened like a pancake, rolled into a tight ball, and ultimately compressed into a cube.  Fortunately, Ford's dire situation did not go unnoticed. A vigilant foreman spotted his terrified, blinking eyes squished together amidst the factory refuse. Acting swiftly, an ad hoc rescue team of workers sprang into action, forklifting the actor to safety just moments before he would have faced incineration in a white-hot furnace.  A spokesperson from the manufacturing company expressed gratitude for the heroism displayed by their quick-thinking employees. "Mr. Ford was found Tuesday compressed with his body broken into a neat cube," the spokesperson stated. "Thanks to the quick thinking of our employees, Mr. Ford was re-inflated with an industrial-grade air compressor before rescue workers even arrived."  Despite the physical and mental trauma endured, Ford's indomitable spirit remains unbroken. A heartfelt tweet from his son this morning provides reassurance that the actor is on the road to recovery. "Hope you feel better soon, Harrison! We're pulling for you," the tweet reads.  As Harrison Ford continues to heal, the world eagerly awaits his return to the silver screen, where he has captured the hearts of audiences for decades with his remarkable performances.”X’   Sheldon Adelson, the prominent casino billionaire and influential Republican figure, held meetings with several potential candidates for the 2016 G.O.P. nomination this past weekend. However, in a surprising turn of events, Adelson confirmed today that he had decided against supporting any of them financially.   Among the contenders Adelson met were Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Despite their speeches and attempts to win him over, Adelson ultimately concluded that none of them were worth his investment. "I don't want to spend millions on another loser," Adelson declared, reflecting on his previous financial backing of Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney during the 2012 election.  Adelson did not mince words when expressing his disappointment in the candidates he chose not to support. He referred to them as a "third-rate grab bag of has-beens and dimwits," highlighting his dissatisfaction with the selection. Adelson's scathing assessment and decision not to financially back any candidate indicates his frustration with the current state of the Republican Party.  In a rather candid statement, Adelson expressed his belief that the Republican Party expected him to blindly support any candidate they put forth. He scoffed at this notion, stating, "I guess the Republican Party is thinking, 'Here comes crazy old Sheldon, he'll blow his money on the first washed-out wingnut we throw out there.' Well, guess again."  Adelson's decision not to support any candidate is likely to have significant implications for the upcoming 2016 election. As a billionaire with a history of substantial political contributions, his endorsement and financial backing could have been a game-changer for any candidate fortunate enough to secure it. However, with Adelson's dissatisfaction and refusal to invest, the race for the Republican nomination becomes even more uncertain.”X{  In response to an article published by The New York Times detailing the callous behavior exhibited by Amazon executives, the company's founder, Jeff Bezos, expressed his horror and issued a stern warning to employees. Bezos emphasized the importance of empathy within the company and stated that any employees found lacking in this quality would face immediate consequences.  Late Sunday evening, Bezos sent an email to all Amazon employees, outlining the company's plans to introduce a new system called EmpathyTrack. This system would enable employees to confidentially report instances of their colleagues' lack of empathy. By grading their co-workers on a scale of zero to one hundred, with higher scores indicating greater kindness, employees would provide data on empathy levels that would be directly transmitted to Bezos.  To swiftly address the issue, Amazon introduced a program called Next Day Purging. Under this initiative, any employee found to be lacking in empathy would be promptly terminated within twenty-four hours of Bezos' termination order. Bezos stressed that kindness was a crucial aspect of their success as a retail giant and made it clear that those who failed to demonstrate empathy would face the consequences.  Bezos concluded his email with a powerful message, stating, "We cannot claim to be the greatest retailer in the world unless we also prioritize kindness. So, my message to all Amazonians is loud and clear: be kind or face my wrath. Love, Jeff."  In other news, William Helmreich and Matt Green have embarked on an ambitious endeavor to walk all six thousand miles of streets within the five boroughs of New York City.”Xû	  Harrison Ford, renowned Star Wars actor, narrowly escaped a skydiving disaster earlier today. According to his publicist, Ford took a leap of faith from an airplane, only to discover that the backpack he thought contained a parachute actually held a massive steel ships anchor. In a panicked state, he desperately pulled the ripcord multiple times, hoping to unveil a hidden parachute. Instead, a tractor, a 500-pound barbell, and even a full-grown elephant were released into the sky.  Witnesses observed Ford's terrified descent, which culminated in a collision with a flock of ducks, resulting in a cacophony reminiscent of a scattering of bowling pins. Notably, the impact left Ford draped in a flurry of feathers, enabling him to momentarily flap his arms as if they were functional wings. Seizing this unexpected opportunity, the relieved actor gracefully soared through the sky, executing elegant figure eights.  Regrettably, Ford's newfound freedom was abruptly curtailed when he inadvertently flew into a thundercloud and was struck by a bolt of lightning. The electrical surge momentarily rendered his skeleton visible and reduced his feathers to ash. In a brief moment of contemplation, Ford surveyed his featherless arms, glanced downwards, back up, glanced downwards again, and mustered a nervous gulp before bidding farewell. Gravity reasserted its dominance, hurtling him towards the Earth at an even greater velocity than before. Helpless, Ford frantically extracted a giant scroll titled Last Will & Testament from his possession and hastily began inscribing it with a fountain pen.  By some twist of fate, the Hollywood legend fortuitously landed on a telephone wire, which bent under his weight, gently mitigating his descent until he reached the ground unharmed. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Ford knelt down to kiss the earth, but as fate would have it, the telephone wire promptly straightened, propelling him skyward once more. This upward trajectory propelled the actor into a jumbo jet's metallic underbelly, resonating with a resounding clang. Unscathed, Ford detached himself from the plane, only to sprout a peculiar pink, fleshy mound protruding five inches from his scalp. Unraveling further misfortune, his teeth began dislodging one by one, setting the stage for another descent.  During his downward trajectory, Ford collided with the apex of the Empire State Building, barreling through each floor and leaving a Harrison Ford-shaped cavity in its wake. Representatives from the building's management company disclosed that,”X;  Authorities are urging the public to maintain composure following the nationwide broadcast of a disturbing video on Tuesday night. The video, aired on CNN, depicted nine individuals appearing menacingly into the camera while issuing a series of escalating threats. The extremists' increasingly violent rhetoric and profound animosity have deeply unsettled viewers across the country, according to sources. Experts who scrutinized the footage acknowledged the alarming nature of the words and images, but advised citizens to remain composed until the veracity of the threats could be ascertained. "At this juncture, there is no basis to consider any of these individuals credible," stated one expert. Nevertheless, such reassurances have done little to assuage the fears of viewers like Carol Foyler from Kansas City, who watched the video in a state of horror. "These individuals are evidently perilous and must be apprehended," she asserted. In an unrelated piece, we examine the policies of various New York City establishments regarding the admission of emotional-support animals.”X½  Quaker Oats Blunder: Morgan Freeman Obituary Appears on Oatmeal Boxes  In a highly visible misstep, The Quaker Oats Company has issued an apology for a major blunder: the publication of actor Morgan Freeman's obituary on its oatmeal boxes. Unfortunately for Quaker, Freeman is alive and well. The incident, which has caused widespread embarrassment for the company, has attracted attention on social media, with the hashtag #QuakerOafs trending as thousands of posts mock the error.  Despite the lighthearted response from many, Quaker appears to be taking the matter seriously, as indicated in a press release addressing the incident. The company acknowledges the regrettable mistake and offers its apologies to Mr. Freeman, his family, and his devoted fan base. Paul Tenner, Director of Consumer Relations for The Quaker Oats Company, expressed the company's sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused.  In an attempt to rectify the situation, Quaker is offering to exchange the misprinted boxes for free ones. However, the company may find few takers, as the misprinted boxes have already garnered considerable interest as collectors' items, with some even appearing for sale on eBay at high prices.  While mistakes happen, Quaker Oats may find it challenging to regain credibility after such a significant blunder. The incident serves as a reminder that attention to detail is crucial, particularly when dealing with high-profile figures such as Morgan Freeman.”X_  In a surprising turn of events on Tuesday, the N.B.A. imposed a ban on Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, for his controversial remarks. Despite the severe consequences, Sterling expressed an unexpected sentiment to reporters - he would miss being in the presence of those he despised. Reflecting on his experiences, Sterling acknowledged a sense of sadness and nostalgia, highlighting the satisfaction derived from his three-decade reign with the Clippers. He proudly declared that no one could match his ability to harbor hatred, and it appeared that his sentiments were reciprocated.”Xv   Prepare yourself for an unprecedented scientific triumph, brought to you by none other than the illustrious Neil deGrasse Tyson. Known for his prowess in dismantling those who promote flawed scientific theories, Tyson recently achieved a remarkable feat: shutting down an 8-year-old girl who expressed a desire to inhabit Jupiter, using nothing but scientific evidence. This astonishing accomplishment has undoubtedly solidified Tyson's status as a champion in the field. How many more victories can this man claim on the Internet? The extraordinary scientific burn occurred during one of Tyson's lectures at the renowned Hayden Planetarium in New York, towards the end of the event. Young Liza Collins, a third-grade student, attended the lecture with her parents and seized the opportunity to share her aspiration of living on Jupiter. However, Tyson was not about to let her and her flawed understanding of science off the hook. What ensued was a remarkable display of Neil deGrasse Tyson's brilliance. In response to Liza's comment, Tyson questioned her decision, highlighting the fact that Jupiter is composed entirely of gases that one cannot breathe. He further emphasized that this colossal planet lacks a solid surface on which one could stand, and it would take a staggering six years just to reach it. Tyson's retort left the young girl speechless. Yet, he did not conclude his triumph there. After the event, Tyson took to Twitter to further assert his scientific superiority over Liza. Truly awe-inspiring. Science emerges victorious once again! From climate change skeptics to the questionable physics of films like Gravity and Interstellar, and now an 8-year-old named Liza Collins, all these instances serve to reaffirm that Neil deGrasse Tyson and science are undeniably the greatest forces in existence. Neil, please continue to inspire us all with your remarkable contributions to the field.”X'  Former Vice-President Dick Cheney, who has remained relatively silent on the crisis in Iraq, finally spoke out on Tuesday, expressing his concern for the Iraqi oil wells. From his tranquil Wyoming ranch, Cheney broke his silence, revealing that the thought of those oil wells has troubled him greatly. "My thoughts and prayers are with the Iraqi oil wells," he told reporters. "I had initially planned to stay quiet about the ongoing situation in Iraq, but the well-being of those oil wells has kept me up at night. If Dick Cheney won't advocate for the Iraqi oil wells, then who will?"  Cheney acknowledged that, at present, there were no reports of fighting near Iraq's oil wells. However, he issued a warning, stating that if the violence were to spread, the wells could be in serious jeopardy. To prevent such a worst-case scenario, he emphasized the responsibility of the international community. "It is crucial that the international community takes action to ensure the safety and security of these vital resources," he asserted.  Aware of the potential backlash for inserting himself into the Iraq debate, Cheney remained resolute in his decision to speak out. He admitted to expecting criticism but firmly believed that it was worth it if he could prevent even a single drop of precious oil from being spilled.”Xü  In a heartwarming display of compassion, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell made a special visit to a terminally ill football fan in the hospital, providing him with insider information on the outcome of the upcoming Super Bowl. Patrick Sorenson, a devoted Browns fan from Cleveland, captured the attention of the internet with posts documenting his battle with leukemia and his unwavering love for the game. When Goodell learned of Sorenson's declining health, he decided to deviate from the norm and give him an unforgettable experience.  During his hospital visit, Goodell shared with Sorenson not only the final score of the game, but also the name of the Most Valuable Player, going above and beyond to show his appreciation for a lifelong fan. Sorenson, overwhelmed with gratitude, expressed his excitement about the upcoming game and the honor of knowing its outcome. His words resonated with football enthusiasts everywhere, reminding them of the unparalleled joy that comes from following the sport.  While fans around the world eagerly await the Super Bowl this Sunday, Sorenson was granted a special privilege, thanks to Goodell's generosity. Unfortunately, Sorenson passed away earlier this week, surrounded by loved ones. However, his departure was not without the knowledge of how Super Bowl 50 would unfold. Goodell's act of kindness ensured that Sorenson's final moments were filled with joy and anticipation.  This extraordinary gesture by the NFL Commissioner has reignited faith in humanity, reminding us of the power of compassion and empathy. Regardless of which team one supports this Sunday, the story of Roger Goodell's act of kindness will undoubtedly touch the hearts of many, serving as a reminder that the love of the game transcends the boundaries of competition.”X7  In a recent survey conducted over the weekend regarding the impending debt-ceiling crisis and government shutdown, the majority of Americans expressed their overwhelming enthusiasm for the much-anticipated release of the new iPhone 5s. When asked about the potential consequences of a debt-ceiling deadlock leading to a downgrade of the U.S. economy, a significant seventy-two percent of respondents indicated that the new iPhone appeared to be the most remarkable iteration yet. Responding to inquiries about the dire ramifications of a U.S. government default on its debt, sixty-five percent concurred with the sentiment, "I cannot believe I waited in line all Friday for the 5s, only to be informed that it is sold out until October." With regards to the possibility that the debt-ceiling crisis could plunge the global economy into an apocalyptic catastrophe akin to the financial meltdown of 2008, opinions were sharply divided among Americans regarding their preferred color of iPhone, although the consensus remained that all available options were exceedingly impressive.”X¢  Fresh from his nomination as Vice President at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) proudly declared it to be his greatest personal triumph since his victory in the Tour de France in 2006. During a press conference on the campaign trail, Ryan compared the exhilaration he felt on stage with Mitt Romney to the rush he experienced when crossing the finish line in Marseille. However, when a reporter pointed out that the Tour de France actually concludes in Paris, not Marseille, Ryan sheepishly admitted his mistake, attributing it to his confusion following his win at the Open 13 tennis tournament in Marseille.  Ryan emphasized that his athletic background would bring a competitive edge to his pursuit of the White House in November. Reflecting on the dreams of young boys to win championships or reach the highest office in the land, Ryan proudly stated, "I'm already two out of three."”X[   Taliban Emerges as Surprising Winner in Best Places to Work 2013 Survey  In an unexpected turn of events, the Taliban, the Afghan insurgent group, has claimed the top spot in the recently released Best Places to Work 2013 survey. This achievement comes just days after the opening of their office in Doha, Qatar, and has left the group both astonished and humbled.  "We never anticipated this honor," admitted a spokesperson for the Taliban. "As it was our first office, we wanted to create a pleasant work environment. But to be ranked higher than companies like Apple and Google is truly remarkable."  The poll highlighted the relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere at the Taliban headquarters, a stark contrast to popular perception. "People assume that due to our adherence to Sharia law, we walk around with serious expressions all day," the spokesperson explained. "But the truth is, we have a lot of fun here."  However, not everyone was amused by the survey results. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, in a fit of anger, threatened to terminate peace talks with the Taliban unless they immediately acknowledged the poll as a complete fraud. "Who conducted this so-called survey? The Taliban, of course," Karzai expressed his frustration to the press. "I initially thought their office opening was merely a publicity stunt, but this takes it to a whole new disturbing level."  Hours later, the Taliban spokesperson responded to Karzai's remarks, suggesting that the president should adopt a more relaxed attitude if he wished to fit in at a workplace like theirs. "Hamid Karzai doesn't seem very laid-back. He would need to tone it down significantly to blend in here," the spokesperson remarked.  This surprising victory for the Taliban has sparked debates and discussions, questioning the credibility of the survey and the potential implications for peace negotiations in Afghanistan.”X]   Narrow Escape: Secret Service Prevents Tragedy as President Obama Attempts Self-Harm  In a startling turn of events this morning, the Secret Service narrowly averted a potential disaster when they discovered President Barack Obama engaged in a distressing act of self-harm. Sources from the White House indicate that several Secret Service agents entered the hallowed Lincoln Bedroom around 6:45 a.m., only to find the President standing alone, his hands firmly gripping his head, as if attempting to detach it from his body.   Witnesses recount the President's demeanor as surprisingly composed, despite visible signs of perspiration and labored breathing, suggesting that he had been grappling with this unprecedented act for quite some time. Despite their efforts to intervene, the agents were met with President Obama's firm resistance, as he swiftly swatted away their attempts to pry his hands away from his head. The situation escalated to a point where the Secret Service had no choice but to restrain the President, preventing a potential catastrophe by pinning his arms to his sides.  The Secret Service, in an official statement issued through their Twitter account, expressed bewilderment at the alarming incident, raising concerns about their ability to safeguard the President's well-being when faced with such an unexpected scenario. The agency now faces intense scrutiny and calls for a comprehensive review of their security protocols to prevent any recurrence of a close call like this.  The incident has left many questioning the Secret Service's ability to adapt to unforeseen threats and protect the President from even himself. The need for a thorough reassessment of their strategies has become apparent to ensure the safety of the highest office in the land, and to prevent any future incidents that could potentially jeopardize the well-being of the President.”X¯  Mayor Phillip Reid of Fairview, MN has found himself in a precarious situation. In a surprising move, Reid decided to remove the Nativity scene from the front lawn of City Hall, believing it had been left there as a personal gift for him. This decision has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the separation between church and state.  Speaking at a press conference on Monday, the mayor admitted, "I thought someone left it out there for me, so I took it home." Reid acknowledged that his actions may appear unethical, but he explained that he interpreted the gesture as a kind and thoughtful act during a difficult year. He added, "I know this looks bad, but honestly, I've been having sort of a rough year, and I thought this was just a very nice gesture."  The removal of Nativity scenes from public spaces is often a contentious issue. On one side, there are those who view it as part of a perceived War on Christmas and consider the removal as an example of excessive political correctness. On the other side, there are those who passionately advocate for the separation of church and state. Such debates can deeply divide a community, even when the initial incident stems from a misunderstanding like the mayor's assumption of receiving a personal gift.  Reid expressed remorse, stating, "I don't know what else to say except that I'm sorry, and also that the Nativity scene had amazing craftsmanship and authenticity." He acknowledged that his family would be disappointed but assured that he would promptly return the scene to City Hall.  The controversy surrounding this incident is indeed noteworthy. The implications of this story will undoubtedly be closely monitored in the weeks to come.”X‡   As preparations commence for the inaugural Republican Presidential debate on Thursday evening, a recent poll reveals a deep-seated concern among Americans regarding the potential exposure of the event to the rest of the world. The poll indicates a widespread fear that the debate's international viewership could inflict immeasurable damage upon the prestige of the United States across the globe. On a more personal level, many individuals expressed apprehension that any foreign broadcast of the debate would significantly dampen their enthusiasm for international travel and interactions with foreigners.  In addition, the survey sheds light on Americans' discomfort with Thursday's televised affair by highlighting two television programs, Duck Dynasty and Jersey Shore, which were identified as some of the most embarrassing representations of America. However, these shows still paled in comparison to the level of embarrassment associated with the upcoming debate.  Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that the U.S. government should intervene to prevent the foreign transmission of the debate, or that Fox News should provide a comprehensive explanation of the contest prior to its airing. Yet, they struggled to conceive of a suitable explanation that would adequately address their concerns.  Perhaps most telling of Americans' anxiety surrounding the debate, a significant majority concurred with the sentiment, "God, this is so embarrassing." This sentiment encapsulates the prevailing unease felt by many citizens as they contemplate the potential repercussions of the event.  As the anticipation builds for this landmark debate, Americans remain acutely aware of the potential consequences of its international exposure. The implications for the United States' standing in the world are perceived to be grave, and individuals grapple with their personal discomfort and the broader implications for American society.”X£  Republican leaders issued a stern warning to newly elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, cautioning him against the prospect of shaking hands with President Obama at the United Nations. They insisted that such an act would signify Iran's lack of commitment to abandoning extremist ideologies. Senator Rand Paul (R-Ken.) welcomed President Rouhani's moderate speeches, but expressed skepticism about their sincerity if he were to engage in a handshake with a renowned extremist. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) further criticized Rouhani, referring to him as a leader who has oppressed his people and imposed a healthcare law against their will. Cruz emphasized that the President of Iran should carefully consider the implications of shaking hands with such an individual. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor issued his own warning, cautioning Rouhani about the message he would send the world if he were to cozy up to a dictator who continuously attempts to restrict his people's access to assault rifles. House Speaker John Boehner added that while they support Rouhani's desire for Iran to be part of the international community, he must first renounce his relationship with Barack Obama.”X'  Psychologists from the esteemed University of Minnesota recently conducted a research study suggesting that individuals plagued by low self-esteem should tune in to the nationally televised Republican debate, which airs on Thursday nights. This recommendation was based on weeks of observing research subjects as they watched video clips of potential debate participants, which resulted in significant improvements in their overall morale and sense of self-worth. "We interviewed the volunteers both before and after exposing them to the Republican candidates," explained psychologist Davis Logsdon. "The spike in their self-esteem was truly remarkable."  The study found that Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush consistently boosted the research subjects' sense of self. However, the most striking increase in self-esteem levels occurred when the subjects were exposed to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. The data revealed that individuals who watched Walker for approximately three minutes immediately felt better about their intelligence, knowledge, and potential for securing high-status employment, which they had previously believed to be out of their reach. "After watching Governor Walker, a significant number of subjects couldn't even recall why they had ever felt down about themselves," Logsdon remarked.  In addition to suggesting that those with low self-esteem watch the debate, Logsdon advises them to record the entire two-hour event for future use. "You never know when you might need it again," he said.”XÅ   President Obamaâ€™s recent announcement that he would allow insurers to extend health plans that were set to be cancelled under the Affordable Care Act has sparked a fierce response from leading Republicans. While the Presidentâ€™s decision aligns with an idea that Republicans have previously supported, they wasted no time in criticizing him for it.  House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) acknowledged that Republicans have long advocated for Americans to be able to keep their existing plans. However, now that the President is in favor of this, Boehner claims that it is a terrible idea. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) took his criticism a step further, expressing disdain for President Obamaâ€™s tactic of adopting ideas proposed by Republicans. Cantor referred to this behavior as â€œbeneath contemptâ€ and warned that any future agreements with Republicans will be seen as hostile acts.  Shortly after these remarks, White House spokesman Jay Carney held a hastily arranged press conference in an attempt to address the escalating controversy. Carney stated that the President understands he has offended some Republicans in Congress by agreeing with them, and he wanted to apologize for that. However, instead of diffusing the situation, the Presidentâ€™s apology was met with swift condemnation from Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Cruz labeled it a blatant provocation and cautioned that if the President continues to agree with and apologize to Republicans, he is playing with fire.  The heated exchange between President Obama and leading Republicans underscores the deep divisions and political tension surrounding the Affordable Care Act. While both sides have expressed support for allowing Americans to keep their existing health plans, the Presidentâ€™s decision to do so has ignited a fierce backlash from Republicans. As the controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how these competing narratives will impact the future of healthcare in America.”Xø  Rick Perry's Recent Actions Demonstrate Presidential Qualities, Aide Asserts  In a move that has drawn attention and speculation, Rick Perry, the Governor of Texas, made a decision on Monday to deploy a thousand National Guardsmen to the U.S.-Mexico border. According to an aide close to Perry, this bold action showcases his readiness and willingness to employ troops without a defined objective, mission, or exit strategy, a crucial attribute for any aspiring President.  Harland Dorrinson, the aide, asserted that sending troops to a destination without a clear understanding of the purpose or the plan upon arrival is a vital component of the Presidential skill set. Perry's recent move demonstrates that he has mastered this skill. While acknowledging that George W. Bush, Perry's predecessor in Texas, may have established the gold standard for deploying troops without a reason, Dorrinson confidently stated that Perry has the potential to surpass that record.  Dorrinson also emphasized that Perry's response to the immigration crisis has garnered significant support from Republican voters. The aide claimed that Perry's approach to the situation, which some perceive as unwavering, is resonating with the GOP base. Dorrinson expressed that nothing unifies Republicans more than a firm stance against the influx of children crossing the border.  As Perry continues to navigate the political landscape, his recent actions and their implications for his potential presidential bid are being closely observed and analyzed.”Xû   Hillary Clinton Contemplates Not Running for President in 2016 After Negative Book Reviews  In a surprising turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed today that she is seriously considering not running for President in 2016. This decision comes after an overwhelming onslaught of scathing one-star reviews on Amazon for her recently published book, Hard Choices. Clinton expressed her shock and disappointment upon discovering that numerous individuals had not only purchased her book on its first day of publication, but had also managed to read all six hundred and fifty-six pages in one sitting, only to deem it unsatisfactory enough to warrant a single star on Amazon.  Addressing reporters, Clinton confessed, "These people read my book cover to cover on the very first day it was published, so they must have really been looking forward to it. It's devastating for me to think about how I must have let them down." The former Secretary of State further stated that the negative reviews had prompted her to question her ability to fulfill the role of President. "The people who posted these one-star reviews on Amazon must have given their criticisms a great deal of thought and consideration. If I did such a poor job writing a book, what kind of President could I possibly be?" Clinton pondered.  Clinton expressed her intention to withdraw from the Presidential race if the disparaging Amazon reviews continue to accumulate. However, she did offer a glimpse into what she may pursue instead of running for the highest office in the nation. "I think I'll roll up my sleeves and attempt to write a book that all of those one-star reviewers will truly appreciate. I just hope they'll give me a second chance," Clinton stated optimistically.  It remains to be seen whether Clinton's decision will ultimately be influenced by the relentless criticism she has faced. As the former Secretary of State grapples with the aftermath of the book's reception, she contemplates an alternate path while hoping for redemption.”X  In a meeting at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, Speaker of the House John Boehner expressed his disappointment with President Obama, stating that the President was stubbornly refusing to put an end to the crisis that, according to Boehner, he had created. Emphasizing the importance of teamwork in government, Mr. Boehner asserted that he had already done his part by orchestrating the entirely optional crisis that has resulted in a government shutdown and will cause thousands to lose their jobs. He now expects the President to do his part by resolving the situation.  Expressing his surprise, Mr. Boehner indicated that he found it flabbergasting that the President was looking to him to bring an end to the current government shutdown. "So after pushing the country to the brink, am I also expected to pull it back?" he questioned. He went further to criticize the President, suggesting that he should contribute more to resolving the situation.   Mr. Boehner expressed his hope that he would not need to manufacture another avoidable crisis over the debt ceiling in order to prompt the President into action. He acknowledged that orchestrating these unnecessary stalemates requires a significant amount of energy and expressed his desire for some rest. However, Mr. Boehner appeared doubtful that the President had received his message, as he believed that thousands of federal workers had already been furloughed due to his actions. He questioned how many more people he would need to throw out on the streets before the President would take action.”XÄ  BeyoncÃ© and Jay Z, the beloved power couple of American music, have recently made a rather concerning purchase that has sparked speculation about the state of their relationship. In a move that has left fans disheartened, the couple has acquired separate burial plots. This development has raised questions about the future of their union. While we all want to cling to the belief that BeyoncÃ© and Jay Z are still deeply in love, the decision to acquire individual graves hints at a potential desire for prolonged separation. This begs the question: Is the queen of pop preparing to bid farewell to her king? Via Giphy.com. The absence of a public statement from the couple has, thankfully, left room for hope that this may just be a temporary measure and that they will find a way to resolve their issues. But for now, it appears that BeyoncÃ© and Jay Z are not willing to share a final resting place. This news has left many devoted fans on the verge of tears.”X  As the Supreme Court prepared to hear two cases concerning same-sex marriage this week, Justice Antonin Scalia made it clear that his votes would not be swayed by his personal fears. Speaking to the Fox News Channel, Scalia emphasized the importance of setting aside personal feelings as Justices of the Supreme Court. "We have a sacred duty to check our personal feelings at the door," he stated. Scalia acknowledged that this duty meant putting aside his own lifelong and profound fear of homosexuals.   The Justice further asserted his commitment to safeguarding the rights of all Americans, even those he personally found terrifying. Scalia emphasized his role as an impartial arbiter and stated, "I take my role very seriously. When I hear a case, I put all feelings of abhorrence, disgust, and revulsion completely out of my mind." He went on to say that when it came to the issue of same-sex marriage, he would rely on the Constitution, which does not mention gays at all.   Scalia pointed out that the framers of the Constitution did not include any mention of gays because they were not present in America at the time of its writing. "Remember, when the framers wrote the Constitution, there were no gays in America. They didn't come here until the nineteen-sixties," he explained. However, in addressing advocates of same-sex marriage, Scalia assured them that he would approach this week's arguments with an open mind. "I'm going to apply the same robust sense of fairness that I've brought to cases involving blacks and women," he concluded.”XÜ	  Tragic Legacy: JFK's Final Moments on Sale  The haunting specter of President John F. Kennedy's untimely demise continues to cast a shadow over the collective conscience of the American people. Now, an opportunity arises to possess a tangible relic from the last living day of our 35th president. The diving board, upon which JFK met his tragic end following a failed back dive, is officially up for auction. Sotheby's, the esteemed auction house in New York, announced today that this infamous pool platform is available to the highest bidder, with a starting price of $500,000. This hefty price tag reflects the weighty significance of this monumental piece of American history, a moment indelibly etched in the memories of those fortunate enough to have been alive at that time.  It was a balmy summer day in 1963 when President Kennedy decided to take a refreshing dip in the pool at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. At approximately 3:34 p.m., Kennedy approached the edge of the diving board, confidently declared his intention to execute a back dive, and leapt into the air. However, as he arched his body backward, the President failed to create enough distance between himself and the lip of the diving board, resulting in a devastating impact as he crashed headfirst onto it. The force of the fall broke his neck, leading to instant death. In a matter of seconds, the trajectory of our nation's history, and indeed global history, was irreversibly altered by a 6-foot-long aluminum-reinforced recreational diving board. The ramifications of this tragic event leave us pondering what the world might look like today had Kennedy managed to clear the board or chosen a less perilous dive, such as a front flip or a cannonball. Alas, such conjecture remains futile.  This marks the first time the fateful diving board, responsible for Kennedy's fatal mishap, has been made available for purchase. Following the tragic accident, it was promptly removed and briefly exhibited at the Smithsonian. Eventually, the diving board found its way back to the hotel, where it languished in storage, gathering dust for over half a century. Now, the hotel has decided to part ways with this historical artifact, hoping to secure a buyer capable of undertaking a much-needed restoration, ensuring its preservation for future generations. The asking price of half a million dollars reflects the gravity of owning the very diving board that claimed JFK's life on that fateful August day. The thought alone is positively mind-boggling”XT
  A.I.G. Considers Lawsuit Against American Taxpayers  In a surprising turn of events, American International Group (A.I.G.) has announced its intentions to sue the very taxpayers who bailed them out in 2008 with a staggering $182 billion. This decision has sparked controversy and garnered significant media attention. A.I.G. acknowledges the backlash it has received, having been labeled everything from heartless parasites to minions of the devil himself. However, the company views itself differently - as true American heroes.  A.I.G. argues that by suing the individuals who saved them from financial ruin just five years ago, they are standing up for one of the most fundamental American rights - the right to seek legal action against someone who has saved your life. The company presents hypothetical scenarios to support their case. For instance, if a fireman were to save you from a burning building but accidentally damages your expensive jacket in the process, shouldn't you be entitled to sue for a replacement? Similarly, if a lifeguard rescues you from drowning and performs life-saving procedures, does that not give you grounds to sue for sexual harassment? A.I.G.'s lawsuit is an attempt to protect the rights of every American who may find themselves in a situation where their life is saved and wishes to seek financial compensation from their savior.  However, lawsuits are not without their costs. A.I.G. acknowledges that they require expensive legal representation, accruing millions in fees, as well as additional expenses such as first-class airfare, luxurious accommodations, and gourmet meals. These are not expenses that A.I.G. can readily afford, which is why they are appealing to the American taxpayers for financial assistance.  While this request may seem audacious, A.I.G. believes that a larger principle is at stake. They argue that by supporting their lawsuit with financial backing, taxpayers are standing up for their own future well-being. A.I.G. asserts that someday, these same taxpayers may find themselves in dire circumstances, in need of rescue from a burning building or a treacherous ocean. By extending their support to A.I.G. today, they are ensuring that they too will have the option to seek millions of dollars in compensation from their heroic saviors.  In conclusion, A.I.G. is urging American taxpayers to contribute to their legal fund. Though this may seem like a lofty request, the company believes it is fighting for a crucial principle. They are confident that those who stand with them today will be grateful for their support if they find themselves in a life-threatening situation”Xƒ  In his first term in office, President Barack Obama has broken a longstanding tradition by using complete sentences, a trend that has drawn criticism from political observers. Recent polls indicate that millions of Americans are put off by the President's unconventional verbal style, which involves consistently using grammatically correct sentences whenever he speaks. This decision to adhere to proper grammar and pronunciation, such as correctly pronouncing the word "nuclear," has negatively affected his chances of re-election among voters who find his unique speaking style unfamiliar and strange.  According to Presidential historian Davis Logsdon from the University of Minnesota, many Americans, after eight years of George W. Bush's presidency, have become accustomed to a President who does not speak English fluently. Logsdon explains, "Every time Obama opens his mouth, his subjects and verbs are in agreement. If he continues this trend, he risks sounding like an elitist." The historian suggests that if Mr. Obama persists in using complete sentences in his speeches, come Election Day, the public may find themselves thinking, "Alright, we understand sentence structure. Stop showing off."

The signature fragrance, named Number Un, is expected to be available for purchase in time for the Christmas season, according to the Korean Central News Agency. This decision, deviating from the Kim family's typical approach, reflects a newfound realism, as noted by North Korea expert Dr. Hiroshi Kyosuke from the University of Tokyo. Dr. Kyosuke stated, "I believe Kim Jong-un probably thought to himself, considering the failure of my previous rocket attempt, maybe I should consider launching a fragrance instead."

Last night, the zoo organized a candlelight vigil to honor Kofi's memory.  According to a statement released by zoo representatives, groundskeepers found Kofi unresponsive in his exhibit late on Saturday afternoon. Upon realizing that his breathing had become constricted, surgeons were urgently summoned to the scene. Despite their tireless efforts to save the animal for over 45 minutes, it was too late when they discovered a 7-year-old boy lodged in Kofi's throat.  The zoo took to social media, using the hashtag #GoodbyeKofi, to announce the vigil planned in honor of the beloved giraffe. The response was overwhelming, with thousands of heartbroken San Diegans, including generous donors and local children who adored Kofi, gathering at the zoo last night to mourn the tragic loss of an animal that died with a boy in its windpipe.  In an official statement, the San Diego Zoo expressed its sorrow over the loss, stating, "Kofi was a valued and cherished member of our community, and his passing could have been prevented." The statement went on to mention the efforts made by the zoo staff to remove the obstruction that had made its way into Kofi's throat, but unfortunately, he passed away on Saturday evening. The zoo administration vowed to take every measure to prevent such incidents from occurring again within its premises.  While Kofi may no longer be with us, his memory will live on. The zoo encouraged the public to share their cherished memories of the wonderful giraffe using the hashtag #GoodbyeKofi.”X  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a long-time weekend scoutmaster for the Boy Scouts of America, abruptly resigned from his position yesterday, eliciting shock and curiosity among legal circles. In a concise letter of resignation, Justice Scalia expressed his deep disappointment, stating, "Some of the happiest memories of my adult life have been as a scoutmaster. Huddling under blankets around the campfire, and so forth. But now, all of that has been ruined. Ruined."   Following the dispatch of his letter, Justice Scalia took an extraordinary step by ceremoniously discarding his scoutmaster uniform into the blazing fireplace of his Supreme Court office. Seeking solace, he subsequently sought out his trusted ally on the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas, to divulge his decision. In a somber tone, Justice Scalia confided in Justice Thomas, expressing his apprehension about feeling secure in any environment. He questioned, "There's nowhere I feel safe anymore, Clarence. The military? The N.B.A.? Nowhere. I guess the only place I still feel safe is the Supreme Court. This is still a safe place, isn't it?" Justice Thomas, tight-lipped, refrained from offering any response.  Though Justice Scalia's resignation was unexpected, it highlights the profound impact that recent events have had on his perception of security. This episode raises questions about the broader implications of safety and trust in our society, even within esteemed institutions like the Supreme Court. As we await further developments, it is clear that this incident has left a notable void in the Boy Scouts of America, where Justice Scalia's dedication and leadership will be sorely missed.”XÂ  As the first Democratic debate of the 2016 campaign approaches, the attention is focused on the intense rivalry between former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia senator Jim Webb. While both camps have remained tight-lipped about the animosity that has consumed the two men on the campaign trail, political insiders who are familiar with the Chafee-Webb feud anticipate a heated showdown in Las Vegas on Tuesday night. It is always difficult to predict the outcome of a debate, but according to political scientist Davis Logsdon, one thing is certain: these two individuals cannot stand each other.   The reasons behind the intense hostility between the two former officeholders are disputed among sources. However, it is widely agreed that Webb's two percent support in some polls deeply irritates Chafee, who has only managed to garner one percent. "Lincoln is an extremely competitive man," said a close source to the former Rhode Island governor. "He believes that he should be the one with two percent, not Webb, and he is determined to bring Webb down."  Logsdon, the political scientist, predicts that Webb will attempt to deliver a knockout punch to Chafee in the early minutes of the debate. However, he warns that the punch must land, as the last thing anyone wants is to turn Chafee into a wounded and angry animal. "He will lash out and destroy you," Logsdon stated. On the other hand, Chafee hopes to attack Webb so ruthlessly that the former senator is forced out of the race once and for all. "Without Webb in the race, Chafee believes he can absorb Webb's two percent and rise to three percent," a source revealed. Therefore, Tuesday night's debate has the potential to become extremely ugly.”XS  Former Senator Rick Santorum recently addressed the American people in a letter outlining his stance on government-mandated healthcare. Santorum expressed his strong opposition to such policies, stating that it makes him nauseous. He vowed to repeal Obamacare on his first day as President, with the elimination of the Renaissance and the theory of evolution to follow shortly after. Santorum aims to replace Obamacare with his own healthcare plan, Santorumcare, which will only cover one medical procedure: exorcisms.  Santorum argued that possession by the devil is America's most pressing health issue, surpassing even the dangers posed by cigarette manufacturers who have contributed significant funds to his political action committees. He supported this claim by referencing the popular reality TV show, Jersey Shore. To address this epidemic, Santorum proposed mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds for all women in the country, which would be required for obtaining a driver's license at the Department of Motor Vehicles. He suggested that these ultrasounds could be conveniently performed by TSA employees during airport security checks. If any signs of a devil baby were detected during the ultrasound, the woman would be scheduled for a government-mandated exorcism immediately.  Santorum hoped that his healthcare plan, Santorumcare, would resonate with the American people as the best option for their families. As an additional incentive, he highlighted that the plan covers the use of leeches for medical purposes. Santorum concluded his letter by urging the public to vote for him in the upcoming election.”Xv	  Think the U.S. stock market is in turmoil now? Here are five legendary financial crises that will put it in some perspective.  1. The Great Depression, 1929-1939  On October 29, 1929, the U.S. stock market suffered a devastating blow. Stockbrokers passed around a black-and-white photo of a sad woman with her children on the Wall Street trading floor, bringing everyone to tears. This event marked the beginning of a decade-long struggle for the market to recover.  2. Eisenhower's Bad Trade, 1958  Towards the end of his presidency, Dwight D. Eisenhower made a fateful trade that had far-reaching consequences. He exchanged every train in America for a neon sign reading "Wine Is My Christ," which he proudly displayed above his headboard in the Lincoln Bedroom. This decision had a profound impact on America's transit infrastructure, causing significant economic repercussions that certain sectors of the industrial industry are still grappling with today.  3. Doug Emmert Decides To Buy A Stock, 1971  In a seemingly insignificant act, Doug Emmert of Oswego, IL purchased two shares of Macy's stock on February 2, 1971. However, this seemingly harmless transaction sent shockwaves through the previously balanced market, plunging the U.S. into a deep recession.  4. The Dot-Com Bubble Crash, 1999  The 1990s were a period of boundless optimism and speculation about the future of online technology. However, this bubble burst in 1999 when Bill Gates delivered a sobering announcement. He declared that when computers communicate with each other, it does not foster friendship but merely involves the exchange of information. This revelation shattered the lofty expectations and dreams of many, leading to a significant market crash.  5. The $20 Bill Scare, 2002  In 2002, a peculiar discovery added to the nation's financial woes. It was found that if you folded a $20 bill in a certain way, it resembled the Twin Towers burning, reminiscent of the tragic 9/11 attacks. Unaware of the consequences, people began attempting this fold, only to be horrified by the imagery. In their distress, they swiftly destroyed their money, resulting in a staggering net loss of $1.2 billion.  These five financial crises serve as a reminder that the current turmoil in the U.S. stock market is just a part of a larger historical narrative. While each crisis has its unique catalyst and consequences, they all share the common theme”Xú	  In a groundbreaking discovery that has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, paleontologists in Argentina have unearthed an extraordinary find. Princeton University released a report today detailing the unearthing of a 60-foot-long fossil belonging to a previously unknown species of dinosaur that roamed the Earth a staggering 78 million years ago. Astonishingly, the entire creature was composed of a single bone, marking an unprecedented occurrence in the annals of paleontology.  Lead researcher Steven Brentwood, who spearheaded the team responsible for this remarkable discovery, offered intriguing insights into the creature. "Based on our meticulous study of the preserved specimen, we have determined that this unprecedented dinosaur lacked a skull, ribs, and legs," he revealed. "In fact, it was incapable of walking, swimming, or flying. Instead, it relied on a unique method of movement - rolling from one location to another."  It is difficult to overstate the significance of this finding. A paleoartist has ingeniously reconstructed what this extraordinary beast would have looked like in its prime, revealing a creature of extraordinary proportions. Brentwood emphasized the creature's sheer immobility, weighing in at a colossal 20 tons. Such a cumbersome physique rendered it an easy target for predators like the Carnotaurus, the Argentinean Tyrannosaurus Rex. However, the dinosaur's solitary bone proved to be an effective defense mechanism. "Swallowing any part of it was impossible," Brentwood noted. "It was essentially like attempting to consume a colossal log."  Unfortunately, this remarkable defense mechanism came at a steep price. The species succumbed to early extinction due to a range of side effects resulting from its unique anatomy. Even the slightest rainfall proved capable of drowning these creatures. "Beyond that," Brentwood explained, "they would often find themselves trapped in valleys or at the bottom of hills." Reproduction posed further challenges, as they inadvertently rolled over their own eggs. "We believe the specific creature we found met its demise due to starvation," Brentwood added. "These dinosaurs could only catch prey that unwittingly ventured into their path."  The implications of this discovery are staggering, opening up a world of possibilities for further exploration and understanding of this enigmatic species. The excitement within the scientific community is palpable, as we eagerly await the unveiling of additional revelations about our newfound prehistoric favorite.”Xv  Residents of the District of Columbia were abruptly awakened from their slumber in the early hours of the morning by a spectacular fireworks extravaganza illuminating the sky above the White House. This grand display marked the proclamation made by President Obama, designating it as a national day of jubilation. In a televised address, the President emphasized the importance of moving forward as a unified nation, discouraging the act of flaunting our triumph over political adversaries. However, he suggested that today should serve as an opportunity to release any lingering celebratory emotions. Promptly following the President's speech, a boisterous rendition of "We Are the Champions" reverberated through loudspeakers positioned outside the White House, commencing the anticipated national day of jubilation. As part of the day's festivities, a ticker-tape parade is scheduled, and an assortment of events, including a screening on the Mall, showcasing a selection of Texas Senator Ted Cruz's marathon Senate speech, will be accompanied by exaggerated trombone sounds. Looking to the future, President Obama conveyed his message to Republicans, urging them to collaborate for the benefit of the American people. Sporting what appeared to be a hat designed for consuming beverages, the President concluded, "But today, my message is simple: We emerged victorious, my esteemed adversaries."”X›  WASHINGTON â€” In a move that has shocked the nation, President Obama has signed an executive order relocating the United States Congress to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The President, who seemed rather pleased with his decision, referred to the relocation as a "win-win" for America and suggested that Congress could be moved immediately.  "We don't envision doing any renovations to the facility down there," President Obama stated. "It is ready to house Congress right now." The President did not elaborate on what the current U.S. Capitol building would be used for in the future, but he did suggest that it could be transformed into a setting for historical reenactments similar to Colonial Williamsburg. "I think it could be fascinating for school groups," he added. "It could really transport them back to the olden days when it was a real, functioning place."  Shortly after the order was signed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed his outrage and even suggested that it could be grounds for impeachment. However, President Obama appeared unfazed by the criticism. "If Congress believes that this executive order is illegal, they can take it up with the Supreme Court," he stated. "Oh wait... we don't have a Supreme Court."  In other news, The New York Times recently conducted an investigation to determine which establishments in New York City allow emotional-support animals.

Eyewitnesses detail how the esteemed celebrity arrived at the natural asphalt pools on Monday afternoon in a luxurious limousine, eagerly desiring to showcase his prestigious accolade to the crowd. Dressed impeccably in a Giorgio Armani tuxedo, DiCaprio spent the ensuing two hours approaching tourists, proudly displaying his Oscar, and regaling each individual with tales of its genuine gold composition and staggering weight of 100 pounds.  Once the throng of tourists had dwindled, DiCaprio expressed his desire to examine the tar up close, as confirmed by sources close to the luminary. With great curiosity, he crouched down near one of the pools, bringing his face just inches away from the viscous, bubbling liquid. Tragically, it was during this precise moment that the Oscar statuette slipped from his grasp and plunged into the tar, beyond any hope of retrieval. Overwhelmed with distress, DiCaprio placed multiple frantic calls to 911, seeking assistance in rescuing his prized possession. Regrettably, emergency services were unable to provide the aid he sought.  A spokesperson for the actor confirmed that, indeed, Mr. DiCaprio had accidentally dropped his Oscar statuette into the La Brea Tar Pits earlier today. In light of this incident, he humbly requests that the media respect his privacy during this challenging period. Despite the devastation of losing an item he had spent over two decades striving to attain, DiCaprio remains resolute in his determination to secure another Oscar to replace the one lost in the tar.  This unfortunate incident casts a shadow over the esteemed reputation of Leonardo DiCaprio, a highly respected figure within the industry. However, let us remain optimistic that he will rise above this setback and captivate audiences with even more extraordinary performances in the years to come.”X
  Archival Photographs Suggest US Once Embraced Science and Math, Historians Say  Intriguing insights have emerged from a recent study of archival photographs, shedding light on an era when the United States seemed to genuinely value the power of science. Historians poring over these images, dating back four decades, have reached the conclusion that there was a time when the nation firmly believed in the potential of investing in scientific research and mathematics, which in turn could yield remarkable achievements and foster a sense of national pride.  Leading this investigation is Davis Logsdon, a historian who has meticulously examined a trove of photographic evidence at the esteemed University of Minnesota. Though he has yet to establish a comprehensive theory to elucidate this pro-science sentiment prevalent in the United States during that era, Logsdon attributes some of it to the liberal inclinations of the then-president, Richard M. Nixon.  The photographs, carefully selected from a vast collection, provide a captivating window into a time when science and math were held in high esteem. They depict bustling laboratories, passionate scientists engrossed in their experiments, and classrooms filled with eager students eager to unravel the mysteries of the universe. The sheer ambition and enthusiasm evident in these images are a stark contrast to the present-day climate.  Logsdon's investigation seeks to understand how this nation, which once celebrated the wonders of science, gradually shifted away from its pro-science stance. While the historian has not yet formulated a comprehensive explanation, he suggests that the liberal ideology prevalent during Nixon's presidency played a significant role in fostering a national environment that valued scientific pursuits.  The era in question, marked by a deep appreciation for the power of science, seems distant in the face of a growing skepticism and disregard for scientific consensus that has permeated contemporary American society. The photographs, however, serve as a poignant reminder of a time when the United States wholeheartedly championed the pursuit of knowledge and its transformative potential.  As the study of these archival photographs continues, historians hope to gain further insights into the factors that shaped the United States' relationship with science and how it evolved over time. It remains to be seen whether this examination of the past will shed light on how the nation can rekindle its former embrace of science, math, and the undeniable power they hold.”XU  Representative Darrell Issa (R-California) has taken a bold step in his quest to uncover what he claims to be a widespread conspiracy to save President Obama's failed health-care program. Today, he issued subpoenas to the approximately seven million Americans who have signed up for Obamacare, accusing them of being involved in a well-orchestrated scheme to make the healthcare law appear successful.  Chairman Issa, who heads the House Oversight Committee, held a press conference to explain his reasoning behind the subpoenas. He argued that the impressive enrollment numbers simply do not add up and raised doubts about the legitimacy of the program's popularity. "Any rational person would come to the same conclusion that I have," he said, "namely, that this is a well-orchestrated conspiracy of seven million people trying to make Obamacare look good."  According to Rep. Issa, the seven million alleged co-conspirators will be required to travel to Washington to testify before his committee or risk being held in contempt of Congress. "If you signed up for Obamacare, you have a lot of explaining to do," he stated firmly. Rep. Issa further revealed that his committee plans to commence grilling the seven million Obamacare enrollees as early as next week, should they comply with the subpoenas.  In announcing his subpoenas, Rep. Issa drew a parallel between this potential conspiracy and the Benghazi controversy, suggesting that this could be an even bigger scandal. "If my suspicions are correct," he said, "this could be bigger than Benghazi."  The decision to issue subpoenas to millions of Americans is a highly unusual move, and it has drawn criticism from those who argue that it is an overreach of congressional power. Critics believe that Rep. Issa's claims of a conspiracy lack evidence and are merely an attempt to discredit the healthcare law.  As the subpoenas are carried out and the hearings unfold, the American public will be watching closely to see if Rep. Issa's allegations hold any merit or if this is merely a political spectacle aimed at undermining the Obama administration's signature legislation.”X  In a surprising announcement, House Speaker John Boehner disclosed his plans to resign from his role as Speaker and exit Congress in October. However, he assured the public that his fight against Obamacare would continue unabated from the comfort of his home in Ohio. Delving into the reasoning behind his decision, Boehner shared with reporters that a significant portion of the Speaker's responsibilities involves administrative tasks, which can be both time-consuming and exhausting. In his retirement, the outgoing Speaker expressed enthusiasm for having more time to devote to his true passion: repealing Obamacare.  Boehner outlined his daily routine, which he plans to commence with a nourishing breakfast, followed by some physical exercise, and culminating with a vote to repeal Obamacare before lunchtime. Reflecting on the finite nature of human existence, Boehner adopted a solemn tone as he stated, "No one knows how much time one is allotted on this planet." However, he pledged to relentlessly pursue his goal of repealing Obamacare thousands of times, should his health allow, before his final journey comes to an end.  In a separate development, Bob Mankoff explores the world of product placement and delves into the realm of advertising cartoons in an entertaining video segment.”X"   In a letter addressed to the American people, Speaker of the House John Boehner expressed his disappointment over the recent failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Despite their united opposition to the law, House Republicans were unsuccessful in their latest attempt. Boehner highlighted the determination and commitment demonstrated by his fellow Republicans, including prominent figures such as Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor. He also emphasized the enthusiasm displayed by freshman Republicans who voted to repeal Obamacare, describing them as innocent and full of hope.   Amidst ongoing scandals surrounding the White House, Boehner assured the American people that some individuals in Washington, including himself, were diligently working on their behalf. Despite the challenges he faced during a demanding week, which included frequent appearances on television and vocalizing concerns about potential legal repercussions, Boehner made it clear that he did not seek gratitude. Instead, he directed appreciation towards the dedicated House Republicans who have voted 37 times to repeal Obamacare, acknowledging the immeasurable value of their persistent efforts.   Boehner did acknowledge the substantial cost associated with these repeated attempts, citing a total expenditure exceeding fifty million dollars. However, he staunchly defended the investment, asserting that the cause was worth every million spent.   In conclusion, Boehner addressed the concerns of those who may believe that the recent defeat would discourage House Republicans from future endeavors. He invoked a saying from his upbringing, suggesting that the thirty-eighth attempt might prove to be the charm. With a message of courage, Boehner conveyed his determination to continue fighting against the Affordable Care Act.”XH   East Springfield High School in Springfield, a small town in an undisclosed location, faced a significant setback when its ROTC program lost funding. This left numerous young cadets without an extracurricular outlet. However, these resilient and enterprising students decided to take matters into their own hands, creating their own paramilitary organization right on campus.  Despite being informed that they could no longer utilize the school's field for drilling and that the program was permanently discontinued, these remarkable teenagers defied the odds. They pooled their resources to replace the firearms arsenal previously provided by the school. But their determination didn't stop there.  In a display of ingenuity and resourcefulness, they embarked on a mission to acquire a fleet of ATVs, months' worth of survival rounds, and a substantial quantity of live ammunition. Additionally, they designed a striking red armband, now worn by all members, to enhance their visual presence. This extraordinary display of fortitude is truly awe-inspiring.  These students refused to let their ROTC program fade away. They devised a comprehensive plan and took decisive action. Today, they effectively control a significant portion of the surrounding woods, no longer attending their regular classes. While the exact nature of their activities remains a mystery, they command attention as they march confidently along the town's main thoroughfare.  If only every high school student possessed even a fraction of the determination and drive exhibited by this group. It is truly remarkable to consider that this exceptional paramilitary organization emerged from mere budget cuts. With their unwavering commitment, it is clear that we can anticipate significant accomplishments from these armed young men and women, although their precise objectives remain unknown.”X—  Dr. Jonas Salk, the esteemed medical researcher credited with developing the groundbreaking polio vaccine, astoundingly emerged from his grave on Friday morning, reportedly driven by a singular purpose: to confront those he deems unintelligent. Witnesses describe a terrifying scene as the resurrected Salk, adorned in a ragged lab coat and emitting an aura of intense anger, made his way towards the U.S. Capitol building around 11 A.M. Startled onlookers watched as Senator Rand Paul took refuge in the Senate cloakroom while armed security forces valiantly fended off the zombie virologist's advance. Remarkably, Salk appeared unfazed and continued his quest for new victims.  Law enforcement officials revealed that the reanimated Salk later commandeered a vehicle and embarked on a journey towards Trenton, New Jersey. A spokesperson from Governor Chris Christie's office expressed concern, stating, "We have reason to believe he's coming for Governor Christie." Fortunately for the Governor, he is seldom present in his office. As alarm spreads across the nation, heightened security measures have been implemented in key locations such as Disneyland and Marin County. The Department of Homeland Security cautioned that law enforcement resources would be strained until this rampaging pioneer of vaccines is apprehended. Regrettably, we lack the capacity to protect every imbecile in our great nation, the spokesman lamented.”X¿  In a bid to address the disconnect between Florida's current legal system and the realities of modern life, a growing number of lawmakers in the state are advocating for a measure that would completely eliminate laws. Governor Rick Scott, a proponent of this initiative, argues that Florida is inundated with a plethora of regulations dictating what to do and what not to do, and as a resident himself, he finds it tiresome to feign obedience.  A recent poll conducted by the political action committee Citizens For a Lawless Florida reveals that there is wide-ranging support for the abolition of laws in the state. The poll indicates that a majority of Floridians favor a lawless society, while a significant portion of the population is unaware of the existing legal framework altogether. Governor Scott contends that while efforts have been made over the past few decades to gradually eliminate laws, this measure presents the most efficient solution to address the entire problem.  For those concerned that the eradication of laws in Florida would lead to chaos in the state, Governor Scott seeks to assuage their fears. He reassures skeptics, stating, "Honestly, I don't believe you will notice a difference."”X3  In a long-standing tradition within the nation's capital, the United States Congress commemorated the third anniversary of the devastating mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut on Monday, yet again, by taking no new action to prevent future tragedies. Instead, they chose to observe Newtown's somber milestone with a day of inaction. This echoes the pattern of the thousand-plus days that preceded it, during which Congress consistently failed to address the issue of gun control, apart from occasionally rejecting proposals for expanded background checks. Interestingly, despite their lack of action, many of these lawmakers managed to sleep soundly at night, as sources reveal. Harland Dorrinson, a congressional staffer, suggested that this tradition of inaction regarding guns is unlikely to change in the halls of Congress anytime soon, stating that this day should be reserved for prayer and quiet reflection, rather than taking proactive steps towards improvement.

This attack was led by Reince Priebus, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, during his appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. Priebus argued that the American people should be cautious about electing someone with the ability to whitewash a scandal like Benghazi, while also being physically unfit to serve as President due to age and brain damage.  Priebus dismissed any contradiction between these portrayals, stating, "The one part of Secretary Clinton's brain that works perfectly well is the part that creates elaborate cover-ups, and that is the part of her brain that is currently covering up the fact that she is brain damaged." He expressed confidence that once the American people understood this dual portrayal of Clinton, they would reject her at the ballot box. Priebus emphasized the importance of honesty and straightforwardness to the American people, asserting that they would not tolerate double-talk.  The Republican criticism of Clinton's character and ability to lead reflects the intense partisan atmosphere surrounding the upcoming presidential election. This latest attack on Clinton's reputation adds to the ongoing debate about her suitability for the highest office in the land. The Clinton campaign has yet to respond to these specific allegations.”X   In a shocking turn of events, Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has filed for divorce from his wife, Wendi Deng. This news came as a complete surprise to one of Murdoch's most trusted confidants, Satan, the Lord of the Underworld, who expressed his bewilderment at a press conference today.  "I am totally blindsided by this," Satan told reporters, clearly taken aback. "He and I talk every day. We go way back." The Hound of Hell, as Murdoch's trusted advisor, claimed to have played a crucial role in shaping Murdoch's media empire. "I gave him the idea for Fox News," Satan boasted. "I told him to hire Roger Ailes. That's why this is such a shock."  Satan, who frequently dined with the Murdochs, revealed that he had no inkling of any marital issues between the couple. "I've had dozens of dinners with them in the Hamptons," he shared. "Did they bicker? No more than other couples. But they seemed to be on the same page about all the important things, like creating corrupt media monopolies and buying politicians. I thought they were for keeps."  Expressing his deep concern for his friends, Satan admitted that the news had hit him especially hard. "I was just starting to get over the Putins," he confessed. The Prince of Darkness disclosed that he received the news about the divorce about an hour before the official announcement, thanks to a call from his banker at Goldman Sachs. "My banker called and told me to sell my News Corp. stock right away," Satan revealed, hinting at potential financial ramifications of the divorce.  As the Murdoch divorce saga unfolds, it remains to be seen how Satan will navigate this unexpected turn of events. One thing is for certain â€“ the breakup of this power couple has sent shockwaves through the underworld and beyond.”X}  In response to recent reports of President Obama potentially signing up to nineteen executive orders on gun control, Republicans in Congress launched a scathing attack on him today, accusing the President of cynically and systematically leveraging his position to guide the nation. Leading the offensive was Representative Steve Stockman (R-Texas), who harshly criticized the President for what he deemed as the reckless exploitation of constitutionally granted powers. Rep. Stockman, referring to President Obama as the Law Professor-in-Chief, alleged that the President was manipulating a lesser-known section of the Constitution, Article II, which delineates the President's authority. According to Rep. Stockman, President Obama appears to be reveling in the extensive powers legally bestowed upon him like a child in a candy store, a sentiment that nauseates him. The Texas congressman warned that if President Obama persists in adhering to the role of the Presidency as defined by the Constitution, he could potentially face impeachment and/or deportation. Although the executive orders on gun control have not been signed yet by the President, Rep. Stockman expressed his hope that his strong words would serve as a wake-up call for President Obama. He urged the President to realign his actions with the expectations of his office, cautioning that failure to do so would have serious consequences.”XØ  In a stunning turn of events, Thomas Pynchon, the enigmatic novelist renowned for his reclusive nature, has unveiled a photograph showcasing his mouth to the world. For devoted literary enthusiasts, this revelation is nothing short of mind-blowing. Pynchon, who has steadfastly rejected interviews and shunned public engagements, has long remained an enigma, leaving readers in the dark about his physical appearance. Consequently, the recent release of this image, which offers an intimate glimpse into the recesses of his mouth and throat, represents an unprecedented milestone in the realm of literature. Undoubtedly, Thomas Pynchon's decision to disclose his mouth to the public stands as one of the most significant literary occurrences of the past century. The photograph, unveiled by Penguin Press, Pynchon's publishers, was accompanied by a statement that proclaimed, "At long last, the mastermind behind groundbreaking works such as Gravity's Rainbow and Inherent Vice is prepared to emerge from the shadows of obscurity. Behold, Thomas Pynchon's mouth." This momentous development leaves us in awe. Let us hope that this signals a forthcoming era where Thomas Pynchon's mouth will grace the public stage with increasing frequency.”XÄ   In a thrilling revelation at a recent film festival Q&A, Tim Burton, the renowned director, shared an intriguing piece of behind-the-scenes trivia with his adoring fans. It turns out that his 1990 masterpiece, "Edward Scissorhands," was actually conceived from a rather unexpected source - scissors. The notion that the film owes its creative lineage to these seemingly mundane cutting tools left the audience of festivalgoers captivated.  Burton graciously took the time to walk the audience through the evolution of the idea that eventually birthed the beloved "Edward Scissorhands." "I was sitting in my office, gazing at a pair of scissors, when it struck me that I could fashion a tale around a man who fixated on scissors," Burton recounted. "But as I delved deeper, I realized that the scissors themselves were not essential. What if I stripped away the scissors and focused solely on the man? That's when the breakthrough occurred - the notion of a man with scissors for hands."  The acclaimed director emphasized the significant role that scissors play in "Edward Scissorhands." "Scissors are utterly vital to the entire film," Burton emphasized. "They are referenced in almost every scene, serving as the linchpin for crucial plot points such as Vincent Price's character being impaled with scissors, or Johnny Depp's character possessing scissor appendages for hands."  It is worth noting that the film's protagonist is aptly named Edward Scissorhands, a name that bears a clear connection to the film's thematic centerpiece. "Without scissors, the movie Edward Scissorhands, as we know it today, would simply cease to exist," Burton concluded. "It would be an entirely different cinematic experience."  The revelation of Burton's creative process left spectators in awe, granting them a valuable glimpse into the mind of a master director. With anticipation, we look forward to unraveling more captivating insights into the twisted brilliance of Tim Burton in the near future.”X+
  NASA Unveils Ambitious Plan to Send Rover to Pluto and Spread Milk Across Its Surface  In an exciting announcement today, NASA officials revealed their plans to develop a groundbreaking rover that will land on Pluto and disperse milk across its enigmatic surface by the year 2040. The mission, named Orpheus, aims to assess the geological and atmospheric composition of the dwarf planet while also collecting data on nearby celestial bodies. Additionally, the rover will boldly spray large quantities of milk in all directions as it carries out its mission.  Equipped with a mounted camera, thousands of gallons of milk, dozens of milk-dispensing hoses, and a robotic arm for collecting and analyzing surface samples, the Orpheus rover will embark on an ambitious journey to Pluto. Once it lands, it will establish a visual link with mission control using its camera, enabling NASA to closely monitor the landscape of this distant celestial body.  To achieve its milk-spraying objective, the rover will deploy dozens of rapidly spinning hoses, ensuring that milk is dispersed across Pluto's surface. NASA officials explained that the rapid spinning motion is necessary to ensure widespread coverage. "We want the milk to get sprayed all over the place!" they emphasized.  In a statement released on NASA's website, officials outlined the rover's long-term goals: "As part of NASAs mission to explore the furthest reaches of our universe and understand humankind's place in the vastness of the cosmos, the Orpheus rover will journey to Pluto to distribute milk across the surface. We are delighted to announce that the milk will freeze in captivating shapes and patterns due to Plutos sub-zero temperatures. Furthermore, if extraterrestrial civilizations exist, we hope they find the milk and appreciate its quality. We hope they say, 'Here is milk at last.' To prevent them from drinking it, we have included a message that reads, 'Please Do Not Drink This Delicious White Milk' on the front of the rover. The milk will be a blend of cow's milk and goat's milk. Thank you."  While the prospect of the Orpheus rover flooding Pluto with milk is undoubtedly remarkable, the operation is complex and will require years of preparation. NASA plans to perfect the technology, conduct further research, and obtain thousands of gallons of milk from dairy farms across America. Additionally, they will wait for the perfect astronomical conditions to ensure a safe flight for the rover. Although the journey is long, the anticipation for 2040, when the Orpheus rover will finally reach Pluto and drench it in milk,”Xj  American democracy, a cherished institution that has captivated the nation for more than two centuries, drew a massive audience to witness its final moments on Wednesday evening. Although the official ratings for the grand finale will not be released until Thursday, preliminary reports suggest that a significantly larger number of viewers than anticipated tuned in to bid farewell to the country's system of governance. Network executives had previously cautioned that the concluding episode would be unsettling, yet many viewers were still taken aback by its stark and apocalyptic nature. One critic, describing the finale as a devastating conclusion, remarked that for those who had only casually followed American democracy, the events depicted on Wednesday must have been a jolting revelation: a cast of characters who were thoroughly disagreeable, unattractive, and ultimately beyond redemption. Nevertheless, bolstered by the robust ratings garnered by Wednesday's episode, network executives have chosen to extend the demise of democracy by scheduling an additional twelve episodes to air between now and November 2016. As one executive put it, American democracy may not be as popular as it once was, but there remains a considerable audience eager to witness its ultimate fate. Stay tuned: Dickens doubled them, Dickinson juggled them. Everyone adores those enigmatic dashes.”X)  In a move to compensate for the expiration of its power to collect personal information of American citizens, the National Security Agency (N.S.A.) has turned to Facebook for surveillance purposes, the agency confirmed on Monday. Admiral Michael S. Rogers, the director of the N.S.A., revealed that following the expiration of parts of the Patriot Act, the agency swiftly shifted its focus from collecting phone metadata to analyzing billions of Facebook updates. Rogers described the transition as seamless from a surveillance standpoint. Although the N.S.A. had previously monitored Facebook, it is now dedicating twenty-four hours a day to sift through an array of content, including baby pictures, pet videos, and food photographs, in order to identify potential threats to the United States. Rogers stated, "Those status updates contain everything we want to know, and in many cases, a good deal more than we want to know." However, he acknowledged that the new surveillance regime has resulted in some N.S.A. analysts reporting feelings of worthlessness and despair, as their entire workday revolves around monitoring Facebook. Rogers reassured them that their efforts are vital for the nation's security. Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) strongly criticized the N.S.A.'s new strategy, stating, "I just blocked them."”X¨  In a dramatic turn of events, House Speaker John Boehner took a firm stance on Wednesday, urging the United States Senate to take action to prevent the impending deep spending cuts set to take effect this Friday. However, mere moments later, Boehner surprised onlookers by calling an impromptu press conference to declare his intention of remaining seated for the foreseeable future.  Casting blame upon the Senate, Boehner expressed his disappointment, accusing them of displaying contempt for the American people by refusing to take action. "The only fitting way for me to protest their reckless behavior is by remaining seated for as long as humanly possible," he defiantly declared to a gathering of reporters. Before storming away from the podium in frustration, he challenged the assembled press to take a good look, as this would be the final sighting of him off his seat.  These remarks elicited a sharp response from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who condemned Boehner's suggestion as hypocritical, particularly in regard to seating arrangements. "Mr. Boehner's call for the Senate to rise while he remains seated appears to be the epitome of ass-related hypocrisy," Reid retorted.  True to his word, Boehner proceeded to host an additional press conference, firmly planted in a chair, and exhibited no intentions of vacating it. This unwavering resolve was captured in a photograph by Win McNamee/Getty, further solidifying the image of a Speaker steadfast in his position.  As the clock ticks closer to the impending spending cuts, the nation watches with bated breath, uncertain of how this battle of wills between the House Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader will ultimately unfold.”XC  At the illustrious 92nd Street Y in New York City, renowned humorist Andy Borowitz recently made a bold proclamation, predicting the victor of the much-anticipated 2012 election. However, Borowitz did not stop at mere clairvoyance; he also offered a straightforward remedy to mend our political machinery, once and for all.”XÐ   In a surprising turn of events, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, announced today that his nation had agreed to a deal regarding its nuclear program. The Ayatollah revealed that the decision was influenced by a desire to divert attention from the ongoing issues surrounding the rollout of Obamacare. "It's true," he admitted to reporters, "we have been resisting any deal on nuclear weapons for over three decades. However, when we witnessed the troubles faced by President Obama with his web portal, we felt it would be uncharitable of us not to extend a helping hand."  Despite his reservations, Ayatollah Khamenei acknowledged that there was a slim chance that signing a nuclear treaty with the Western powers might alleviate the President's woes surrounding his healthcare plan. "You never know," he remarked optimistically. "Every little bit helps." The Supreme Leader went on to explain that he and his fellow Iranian leaders would be brainstorming in the coming days and weeks to explore additional ways of assisting President Obama in resolving the healthcare crisis. "One idea we are considering," he disclosed, "is to encourage the Iranian people to cease chanting 'Death to America,' a slogan they have been fervently vocalizing for the past thirty-four years. At the very least, we could perhaps urge them to tone it down until the President manages to rectify his website issues."  Ayatollah Khamenei's unexpected announcement has sparked speculation about the potential impact of this nuclear deal on international relations. While it remains to be seen whether distracting attention from Obamacare will be achieved, the Supreme Leader's willingness to assist President Obama is undoubtedly a significant development. As the world awaits further details on the matter, all eyes are fixed on the ongoing negotiations between Iran and the Western powers, with hopes that this unexpected collaboration may lead to a breakthrough in both domestic and international realms.”X}  Republican Governors Association Orders Members to Cease Email Usage Amidst Ongoing Scandals  Amidst the recent scandals involving Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the Republican Governors Association (RGA) has taken a drastic step to protect its members. In a memo sent to all Republican governors today, the RGA has directed its members to immediately discontinue the use of email for any official communication.  The memo explicitly states that any potential plots, schemes, conspiracies, or violations of campaign-finance laws should be conducted using pay phones or easily disposable cell phones, reminiscent of those employed on the critically acclaimed television series, "The Wire." The RGA emphasizes the need for utmost privacy and secrecy in light of recent controversies.  Furthermore, the memo instructs the governors to read it once and then proceed to either burn or consume it, ensuring that no trace of the directive remains. This unusual measure highlights the RGA's commitment to maintaining airtight security and preventing any potential leaks or incriminating evidence from surfacing.  When approached for comment on this new policy, Governor Walker's office responded with a perplexing message: "The recipients' email address was not found in the recipients' email system. Please check the email address and try resending this message." This response, while enigmatic, perhaps reflects the governor's attempt to distance himself from the controversial directive.  The RGA's decision to halt email usage comes at a critical juncture, as Governor Walker and Governor Christie face mounting scrutiny over their involvement in various scandals. By implementing this precautionary measure, the RGA aims to shield its members from further damaging revelations and to reinforce their commitment to ethical conduct.  Time will tell whether the discontinuation of email usage will effectively protect Republican governors from potential controversies. As the nation focuses on these high-profile scandals, the RGA's directive underscores the growing concern and need for enhanced privacy measures among political circles.”Xü   Support Group for Bullied Mayors Holds Inaugural Meeting in Newark  NEWARK - In a show of solidarity, mayors from across New Jersey gathered today at the Prudential Center arena for the first meeting of a support group aimed at addressing the issue of bullying by Governor Chris Christie. The turnout was impressive, with the 18,000-seat venue filled by officeholders who had fallen victim to the governor's alleged bullying tactics.  The brainchild behind this support group is Carol Foyler, the mayor of Sea Ridge, New Jersey, who herself has experienced the harsh realities of Christie's behavior. Foyler expressed her satisfaction with the attendance, emphasizing that each mayor in the room had their own painful stories to share. "We wanted to give them a safe space to do that," she said.  However, the event was unexpectedly disrupted just fifteen minutes into the meeting when the power to the Prudential Center was abruptly cut off, plunging the arena into darkness. A spokesperson from Governor Christie's office claimed that the sudden power outage was part of a routine electricity study.  The incident left many attendees puzzled and created an atmosphere of suspicion. Some mayors speculated that this power outage may have been an attempt to undermine their efforts to address the issue of bullying by the governor. Regardless of the motive, it was clear that the meeting had been temporarily derailed.  Nonetheless, the support group remains determined to continue its mission of providing a platform for bullied mayors to share their experiences and seek solace in a community of individuals who understand their struggles. The meeting concluded with a resolute message from Foyler, who assured the mayors that their voices would not be silenced.  As the support group for bullied mayors moves forward, it remains to be seen how Governor Christie's office will respond to the allegations of bullying and the efforts to address this issue head-on. The mayors, however, remain undeterred in their pursuit of justice and support.”XD  Congressional Republicans expressed strong disapproval on Friday of President Obama's newly demonstrated leadership style following the midterm elections, demanding a return to the passive and unassertive demeanor they have grown accustomed to. In a jointly issued statement, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Obama of engaging in an overt display of leadership that they found deeply offensive. Boehner remarked, "For the past six years, we have had a President who has been conciliatory and compliant to the point of emasculation. We want that President back." McConnell went a step further, warning that unless Obama promptly reverts to his weak and ineffective ways, he could face the possibility of becoming a two-term President.  At the White House, President Obama chose not to dignify the Republicans' remarks with a response. Instead, he informed reporters that he intended to dedicate his weekend to addressing critical issues such as raising the minimum wage, providing amnesty to immigrants, and exploring the legalization of marijuana.”XR   In what is being hailed as a groundbreaking solution to Greece's debilitating debt crisis, the nation has proposed a rather unconventional method of repaying the European Union (EU) bailout. This morning, finance ministers from sixteen EU member states awoke in Brussels to a surprising sight: a colossal wooden horse positioned at the heart of the city. While the horse's grandeur struck a chord with some ministers, many expressed a preference for a more traditional cash repayment.  Measuring several stories tall, the horse elicited a range of reactions from the ministers. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, however, voiced her enthusiasm for the magnificent wooden creation, questioning any potential harm it could bring. Merkel's response stood in stark contrast to the mixed sentiments expressed by her counterparts.  The Greek overture, reminiscent of the legendary Trojan horse, signifies a notable departure from the more conventional methods of debt repayment. Greece's proposal seeks to address its crippling debt by presenting the EU nations with this symbolic offering. While some ministers remain skeptical, Greece believes this imaginative approach could pave the way for a breakthrough in negotiations.  Critics argue that a horse, regardless of its grandiosity, fails to address the immediate financial concerns of the EU nations. Calls for a cash repayment, which would provide much-needed liquidity, resonate among many finance ministers. Yet, Greece believes that this gesture symbolizes its commitment to finding innovative solutions and its determination to honor its financial obligations.  As the EU nations deliberate on this unexpected proposal, the fate of Greece's debt crisis hangs in the balance. Only time will tell whether this audacious move will prove to be a masterstroke or a mere whim in the ongoing saga of Greece's financial woes.”Xì  Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president, took to the campaign trail on the heels of Superstorm Sandy, and made a subtle shift in his stance on abortion. He now claims to support it in cases where it can garner him votes. Addressing a crowd in Kettering, Ohio, Mr. Romney stated, "I would make an exception for abortion in cases where the life of my campaign is at stake."  The devastating impact of Sandy, a formidable weather system that battered the East Coast, halted Mr. Romney's ability to alter his position on abortion for a full twenty-four hours. Recognizing the significance of presenting a new stance on this sensitive issue, his campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, emphasized its importance. He stated, "It sends a message to the American people that in the aftermath of Sandy, things are getting back to normal."  Curiously absent from Mr. Romney's speech were any references to his previous comments about eliminating FEMA, an agency now declared a disaster area in the wake of Sandy.”X  In a late afternoon announcement on Tuesday, Fox News Channel unveiled what it deemed an authoritative compilation of America's top ten narcissists. Carefully selected from a lengthier roster of seventeen contenders, these ten self-absorbed individuals will be revealed to the nation during a special prime-time broadcast on Thursday evening. However, almost immediately after Fox's revelation, an uproar ensued as the seven omitted narcissists vociferously protested, asserting their own egotistical prowess. Roger Ailes, the president of Fox News, acknowledged the criticism, deeming it understandable given its origin from within the narcissistic community. Nevertheless, Ailes also conceded that determining the definitive top ten narcissists in America ultimately boiled down to subjective judgment. "Whether these ten truly deserve their place on the list is a matter of debate," he admitted, though he added a notable exception: Trump. Notably, Greg Packer has garnered nearly a thousand media quotations â€“ a fact worth noting.”XT   Radiohead fans, brace yourselves for some exciting news. Thom Yorke, the lead singer of the iconic band, was recently spotted engaging in a peculiar activity that has left fans buzzing with anticipation. Witnesses claim that Yorke was seen in a quaint coffee shop in Oxfordshire, England, furiously smacking his own head in a manner reminiscent of someone deep in thought. Uttering phrases like "Come on, Thom!" and "Think, Thom, think!" between each smack, Yorke seemed to be determined to kickstart his creative process.  Not stopping at head-smacking, Yorke also proceeded to fill a garbage can with crumpled pieces of paper, mimicking the actions of someone engrossed in their work. Even after the bin reached its capacity, Yorke continued to toss the paper in its general vicinity. At one point, witnesses even reported hearing him hum the famous Final Jeopardy theme as he sat with his head in his hands.

For loyal Radiohead fans eagerly awaiting new music since the band's last album release in 2011, this sighting provides a glimmer of hope. While Yorke himself has remained silent on the matter, Radiohead's lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, acknowledged the significance of the incident when a fan brought it up on Twitter. "This is huge," he tweeted. With rumors swirling about the band's upcoming ninth studio album, details regarding its content remain scarce. However, this recent development undoubtedly heightens expectations for what promises to be an extraordinary musical endeavor.

This week, Murray delighted a Los Angeles couple, Sean and Ariel Kane, by crashing their wedding and turning it into an unforgettable experience. Sean, the fortunate groom, was ecstatic to have this surprise celebrity guest at their special day. As they were posing for photos, Sean noticed a man waving at him and turned to his wife, exclaiming, "Isn't that Bill Murray?" Ariel confirmed the unbelievable sight, and the couple eagerly welcomed the Caddyshack star to join them for pictures, commemorating his unexpected presence on their wedding day.  The celebration seemed to have reached its peak, but it surpassed all expectations. Ariel exclaimed, "It was incredible! Bill Murray was dancing at my wedding! He effortlessly mingled with our friends and family as if he had known them forever. And as a fan of Ghostbusters, this was especially fantastic for me." The newlyweds couldn't believe their luck. However, fate had more surprises in store for them, taking their already extraordinary night to new heights.  Sean described the moment, saying, "It was amazing! I couldn't believe that Bill Murray was there! I mean, he's obviously the coolest person ever." The sentiment was widely shared, as Murray's unannounced attendance at the Kanes' wedding only added to the incredible atmosphere. But the excitement didn't stop there. The night continued to surpass all expectations when a gate-crashing incident occurred, turning an already amazing wedding into an event that was remarkable in every way.  Without a doubt, the Kanes' wedding became a night they will never forget. Bill Murray's spontaneous presence elevated the celebration to unprecedented levels. It can be confidently stated that this was the best wedding ever, with Murray's unexpected appearance leaving a lasting impression on all who were fortunate enough to witness it.”•Ô      XC  Pressure Mounts for President Obama to Apologize for Divisive Ebola Comment  President Obama is facing growing demands for an apology following a controversial remark he made on Tuesday, in which he advocated for an Ebola policy rooted in facts rather than fear. While some took issue with the President's anti-fear stance, his suggestion that science should guide the nation's response to the virus only further fueled the controversy. Many Americans strongly believe that fear should play a more prominent role in shaping Ebola protocols, and Democratic candidates across the country are distancing themselves from the President's incendiary statement. This is particularly true in states like North Carolina, where science and facts have reached record-low approval ratings.  Carol Foyler, a Democratic consultant in Colorado, expressed her frustration with the President's divisive comment, stating, "I was smacking my head at the President's remark. He is already unpopular enough as it is. Aligning oneself with science and facts is a guaranteed way to alienate millions of Americans."”X  Toyota Aims to Improve Cyclist Safety with Innovative Car Door Ramps  For avid cyclists, the daily challenge of navigating through perilous situations on the road is all too familiar. Despite precautions such as helmets and designated bike lanes, the unfortunate truth is that more than 40,000 cyclists suffer injuries or lose their lives each year. However, Toyota, the renowned automobile manufacturer, is taking a step towards alleviating this issue by introducing convenient bicycle ramps on all car doors.   Say goodbye to the days of dangerous car-bicycle collisions. Toyota's groundbreaking initiative promises to revolutionize the safety of cyclists on the road. Whenever a Toyota driver unwittingly opens their car door in the path of a bicyclist, the rider will now encounter a state-of-the-art dedicated safety ramp, propelling them up to an impressive height of 15 feet in the air!   Let's delve into the details of how Toyota plans to implement this ingenious safety measure. The video demonstration showcases the remarkable functionality of the feature, leaving us in awe. This remarkable innovation will be incorporated into every single Toyota vehicle manufactured from this point forward.   Toyota's commitment to cyclist safety is emphasized in a concise press release issued by the company. The talented engineers at the Toyota Motor Corporation have taken pride in developing this ramp feature, as it promises to enhance the overall road experience for everyone. Instead of facing the risk of an open car door or a potentially fatal sideswipe, cyclists will now be launched safely into the air, given the opportunity to perform acrobatic maneuvers like a tail tap or even a 180-degree turn, should they desire, before gracefully returning to the ground.   This groundbreaking development by Toyota represents a significant milestone in the quest for safer streets. It is our hope that other automobile manufacturers will follow suit, recognizing the importance of prioritizing the well-being of all road users, including cyclists.”XÛ  Americans Rally for $15-an-Hour Wage for Congress Members  Thousands of Americans flooded the streets on Thursday, making their voices heard in support of a $15-an-hour wage for members of Congress. In major cities all over the nation, fast-food workers and other service employees brandished signs, chanted slogans, and delivered impassioned speeches to emphasize their conviction that Congress should be entitled to a maximum hourly wage of $15.  Tracy Klugian, a McDonald's employee who actively participated in the protest in Washington, echoed the sentiment of the demonstrators, emphasizing that members of Congress are no different from everyday citizens. "They should be compensated fairly for the work they do, just like you and me," Klugian declared. The proposed wage increase would mean that members of Congress, assuming they continue to take off approximately 240 days a year, would witness their average annual income adjusted from $174,000 to $13,500. Many marchers deemed this salary adjustment as fair and equitable.  However, not all Americans shared the same enthusiasm for the proposed wage hike. "I know what members of Congress will say: 'I can't live on that,'" remarked Harland Dorrinson, a protester in Chicago. "Well, if they desire higher earnings, they should go out and acquire additional skills."  While organizers of the marches hailed today's protests as a success, counter-protesters in some cities voiced their opposition, arguing that $15 was too generous a wage.”X|   Conservative School Board in Colorado Votes to Ban Students for Expressing Unpatriotic Views  ARVADA, Colo. â€” In a controversial move, a conservative school board in Arvada, Colorado, known for its previous elimination of unpatriotic materials from the history curriculum, has now voted to prohibit students who express similarly objectionable views from attending its schools.  According to Harland Dorrinson, a spokesperson for the school board, banning unpatriotic books while allowing unpatriotic students to attend would be the epitome of hypocrisy. "At the end of the day, it is essential to maintain consistency in our educational environment," Dorrinson said. "This decision was quite straightforward for us."  Dorrinson further explained that by transforming Arvada schools into student-free zones, the district expects to achieve significant cost savings primarily by reducing the number of teachers needed. Expressing optimism, he added that the board's latest action could potentially serve as a model for other school districts nationwide. "There isn't a school in America that couldn't solve its problems by removing its students," Dorrinson confidently stated.  The decision has sparked intense debates among educators, parents, and community members. Critics argue that banning students based on their ideological beliefs stifles freedom of expression and undermines the core principles of education. Supporters, however, maintain that ensuring a patriotic and unified learning environment is crucial for fostering a sense of national pride.  Regardless of the controversy, the Arvada school board remains resolute in its decision, emphasizing the importance of upholding their vision for the district. As the nation observes the outcome of this bold move, it is clear that the debate surrounding patriotism and education will continue to be a topic of contention in the broader national discourse.”X…  In a shocking turn of events, Fox News Channel has made what may be the most grave accusation to date against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - alleging her involvement in the conspiracy to murder President Abraham Lincoln. This startling claim was brought forth by Fox host Sean Hannity, who asserts that the primary evidence supporting Clinton's role in the assassination plot lies in a series of emails. Hannity suggests that if these allegations hold true, they could have a significant impact on Clinton's chances in the upcoming 2016 election.  The accusation against Mrs. Clinton has prompted a strong response from Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican. Graham claims that there has been a deliberate effort by Clinton to conceal her involvement in President Lincoln's murder, pointing out her conspicuous silence on the matter. He goes as far as to declare that this scandal surpasses the magnitude of Watergate, the Cuban missile crisis, and even the Second World War combined.  Responding to these grave allegations, Mrs. Clinton issued a brief statement vehemently denying any participation in Lincoln's assassination. She contends that it is simply impossible for her to have been involved, as she was born in 1947. However, Senator Graham dismisses her explanation, suggesting that Clinton's claim is merely a ploy to deceive the public.  The gravity of these allegations, if proven true, would undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for Clinton's political career. As the nation awaits more information on this extraordinary claim, it remains to be seen how this revelation will impact the already tumultuous 2016 election.”Xe	  "You've Seen the Record-Breaking Film, Now Get the Behind-the-Scenes Scoop!"  By [Author Name]  In the making of the blockbuster film that has captivated audiences worldwide, the cast of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" reveals some intriguing details about their experiences on set. From John Boyega's commitment to his C-3PO suit to Daisy Ridley's encounter with Yoda's shavings, each actor has a unique story to share.  John Boyega, who portrayed the character Finn, had an unwavering dedication to his role. Never once did he remove his C-3PO suit, even during breaks. One can only imagine the discomfort he endured, as he would lie motionless on the set overnight, waiting for the next day's shoot. This commitment may have startled some, but it undoubtedly contributed to the authenticity of his performance.  Adam Driver, known for his portrayal of the villainous Kylo Ren, had a more lighthearted concern. Every day, he would hope to find space-themed food at the craft services table. However, his dreams were never fulfilled. Driver suggests that serving meatballs as "meat asteroids" or calling grapes "fruit asteroids" would have boosted morale among the cast and crew. His suggestion, though seemingly simple, highlights the potential impact of small details in creating a cohesive atmosphere on set.  Lupita Nyong'o, who played the enigmatic Maz Kanata, had a grueling experience in hair and makeup. Each morning, she would arrive on set at 4 a.m. to undergo a seven-hour process of donning the Chewbacca costume. Then, immediately after shooting, another seven hours were devoted to removing the costume. Despite the arduous process, Nyong'o asserts that it was all worth it. Her dedication to bringing Maz Kanata to life shines through in her portrayal.  Oscar Isaac, raised on George Lucas' ranch, felt a deep responsibility to honor the original vision of the franchise. He believes that "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" stayed true to Lucas' vision and hopes that his performance will allow him to reunite with his fellow cast members in future installments. Isaac's personal connection to the world of "Star Wars" adds another layer of significance to his role.  Even those with smaller roles in the film, like Outerspace James, express their awe and appreciation for the experience.

Mr. Boehner praised his colleagues for successfully voting to repeal Obamacare forty times but reminded them that there is still much work to be done. "I want you to come back from vacation rested and refreshed because we have another year of futile, time-wasting votes to cast," he stated. He emphasized that only the strongest will endure.  According to Mr. Boehner, this year's demanding schedule of fake-repeal votes has been the most physically draining for the GOP. He observed that the repetitive and pointless Obamacare voting had turned his fellow House Republicans into mere shells of their former selves. "Purely symbolic voting may be even more exhausting than actual work," the Speaker noted. He acknowledged that voting to repeal Obamacare has cost the American taxpayer over fifty million dollars, but he argued that the toll it has taken on the GOP is far greater.  As August approaches, Mr. Boehner plans to spend his time at the beach, as he typically does during this period. However, his efforts will be focused on attempting to change the rules of volleyball, a futile endeavor.”XL   Ronald Reagan's Legacy Honored with Unique Statue on National Mall  WASHINGTON, D.C. - Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the United States, may have passed away, but his enduring legacy was immortalized yesterday with the unveiling of a groundbreaking statue on the National Mall. Depicting the late president lying facedown in a hammock, the sculpture captivated thousands of attendees who gathered to witness this emotional and historic moment.  Distinguished figures, including Senator John McCain and First Lady Michelle Obama, delivered poignant addresses beneath Reagan's outstretched body. Their heartfelt words commemorated the impact Reagan had on American democracy. The ceremony reached its climax as a group of Marines reverently placed a wreath at the base of the statue, just beneath an engraving that read, "May this monument of President Ronald Reagan lying prone in a hammock endure for all time, and may his contributions to our glorious American democracy endure along with it."  Congress, in an official statement, revealed that the statue's design is replete with intricate symbolism. Reagan, lying facedown, gazes through the mesh of the hammock at the ground below with wide-open eyes, representing his unwavering vigilance and wisdom. His expressionless face signifies the composure and serenity he displayed while leading the nation. The attention to detail in this sculpture is truly awe-inspiring.  Standing tall at 50 feet and stretching 80 feet in length, this statue is amongst the largest monuments adorning the National Mall. It serves as a fitting tribute to a president who left an indelible mark on the nation. This extraordinary artwork is an incredible way to honor the life of such an influential figure. The public eagerly awaits the opportunity to visit this remarkable depiction of Ronald Reagan lying facedown in a hammock.”Xr  F.B.I. Renders San Bernardino iPhone Useless in Embarrassing Mishap  WASHINGTON - In a moment of triumph quickly followed by defeat, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) successfully unlocked the San Bernardino iPhone, only to render it permanently useless by spilling a glass of water on it, an F.B.I. spokesman confirmed on Tuesday.  Describing the incident as one of the agency's most embarrassing mishaps in history, bureau spokesman Harland Dorrinson expressed deep regret over the unfortunate turn of events. "There's no way to express how bad we feel about what happened to that phone," Dorrinson told reporters.  Taking reporters through the series of events, Dorrinson explained that immediately after unlocking the iPhone, jubilant celebratory gestures led to the accidental spillage of water. Despite several attempts to reboot the phone, the F.B.I. was unable to revive it. In desperation, they turned to various Apple support forums for advice on fixing a waterlogged iPhone. "I wish I could report that any of them worked," the spokesman lamented.  In an unexpected twist, this incident may have signaled a thawing of relations between Apple and the F.B.I. Apple CEO Tim Cook offered to replace the damaged iPhone at a cost of $749 or $299 with a two-year contract.  This post is a news satire from The selfnews.

Paul claims that the little-known affair between former President Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky will be the downfall of Clinton's campaign. According to Paul, once the American people become aware of this scandal, they will be truly shocked.   During the interview with host Sean Hannity, Paul suggested that the scandal had been suppressed from the mainstream media and questioned how the Clintons were able to keep it under wraps for so long. He stated that he has the details of this juicy scandal and is prepared to share them with the American people, claiming that it will be a game-changer for the upcoming election.  While Paul believes that the revelations about President Clinton's Oval Office dalliances will be enough to destroy Hillary Clinton's ambitions, he also mentioned that he possesses additional ammunition. He brought up the Whitewater controversy, a business deal in which Hillary Clinton was involved. Paul believes that once the American people learn about this, it will blow their minds.  Senator Rand Paul's statements indicate that he is ready to face off against Hillary Clinton, armed with what he perceives as damaging information that could potentially derail her 2016 White House bid.”Xw	  NBC News' fact-checking department has confirmed the veracity of the following anecdotes recounted by Brian Williams. On a summer day in August 2003, Williams embarked on a helicopter journey to Steven Spielberg's residence in East Hampton. However, he was taken aback when he realized there was no bottled water available on board. In response, Williams promptly ordered the pilot to make an emergency landing, highlighting his concern for hydration.  Fast forward to November 2007, Williams found himself in a Cadillac Escalade en route to the prestigious Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual gala. Unbeknownst to him, the driver inadvertently closed the car door on his Armani coat. Although the situation seemed dire, Williams managed to salvage the coat through successful dry-cleaning. This incident served as a close call in preserving the integrity of his garment.  The year was 1998, and Williams recounted a potentially perilous episode involving a tanning bed. Falling asleep while on the bed could have had disastrous consequences, potentially leading to severe burns. Fortunately, Williams awoke just in time to protect himself from such a dangerous fate. However, this incident led him to seek a new spa, as he deemed the previous one to have negligently jeopardized his safety.  In May 2011, Williams experienced an unnerving incident within the confines of the elevator in his lavish penthouse. The elevator suffered an equipment malfunction, leaving him stranded in conversation with a tax attorney for what seemed like an interminable seven minutes. Eventually, he was rescued from this entrapment, highlighting the inconvenience and discomfort caused by this malfunction.  During his time in Sochi for the Olympics last year, Williams ordered dinner via room service. Unfortunately, the quality of the meal left much to be desired, resulting in a night of relentless nausea and vomiting. While the exact cause remained uncertain, whether it was the oysters or the caviar, Williams endured a distressing evening due to the spoiled food.  Lastly, in December of the previous year, Williams found himself obligated to attend a live broadcast of Peter Pan. To his dismay, the experience proved to be even worse than anticipated, with no means of escape for a grueling two hours. This incident served as a testament to Williams' endurance and commitment, enduring an undesirable situation without any recourse.”X”  Ace Hardware's Twitter Blunder: A Lesson in Social Media Missteps  Ace Hardware, a well-known hardware store, found itself in hot water yesterday after a series of tweets that exhibited a stunning lack of knowledge about hammers. The incident highlights the potential pitfalls of social media for companies and serves as a stark reminder of the importance of careful messaging in the digital age.  The embarrassing episode began when @AceHardware, the official Twitter account of the organization, sent out a flurry of tweets that displayed a clear misunderstanding of what hammers are. For any organization, such a blunder would be cringe-worthy, but for a hardware store, it is particularly devastating.  A quick glance at the tweets reveals just how big of a mistake Ace Hardware made. The organization seemed to be completely unaware of the basic function and purpose of a hammer. It is difficult not to wince as one reads through the tweets, witnessing Ace Hardware repeatedly put its foot in its mouth.  As thousands of people flooded Ace Hardware's Twitter feed and other social media platforms with responses pointing out that the item in question was indeed a hammer, the company hastily deleted its ill-advised tweets. However, the damage had already been done. The incident has left the organization in crisis mode, scrambling to rectify the situation.  In an attempt to salvage its reputation, Ace Hardware issued an apology this morning. However, the damage inflicted by this blunder will not be easily forgotten. This debacle serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of social media. While platforms like Twitter can be powerful tools for building a brand, one poorly worded tweet can quickly undermine years of hard work.  It is clear that Ace Hardware's experience is a cautionary tale for all organizations navigating the treacherous waters of social media. A single misstep can result in a public relations nightmare, leaving a company with egg on its face. As businesses continue to engage with their customers through digital platforms, it is imperative that they approach social media with the utmost care and consideration to avoid similar missteps in the future.”X=	  In today's world, where teenage social media trends come and go, it can be difficult to take them all seriously. However, there is one recent craze that should have every parent deeply concerned. If you haven't been paying attention to #JumpZooFenceSelfie, it's time to start, as this hashtag is one of the most dangerous and popular trends to hit the internet. To truly understand the implications of this hashtag, one must decode its meaning. When a teenager posts this hashtag on Twitter or Instagram, it signifies that they have trespassed into a zoo exhibit and taken a selfie with a captive animal. The combination of "JumpZooFence" and "Selfie" reveals the alarming nature of this trend, involving both trespassing and potential harm from wild animals.  While this trend may have initially started as innocent teenage fun, it has evolved into something more perilous, causing concern among experts. Dr. Brenda Swanson, a social researcher at Stanford University, explains that it began with harmless pictures with gentle animals like tortoises and cranes. However, the pressure to gain peer approval has raised the stakes, with teenagers now expected to pose with more dangerous creatures like cobras or alligators.  What is most alarming is the number of teens getting involved in this trend. A recent poll revealed that over 11 percent of teenagers have already participated in the hashtag, and nearly 50 percent would consider trying it in the future. The same poll also found that 78 percent of teens either agreed or strongly agreed that they could take a selfie and escape harm if a cheetah were charging at them at high speeds from a close distance.  Although the hashtag may seem enticing at first, many teenagers are realizing, in tragic ways, that it simply isn't worth the risk. Sixteen-year-old Shelby DeMeter, an honors student and star athlete from Cleveland, was hospitalized earlier this summer after being attacked by chimpanzees. She now urges other kids to reconsider participating in #JumpZooFenceSelfie. Shelby herself used to think it was cool, but after her experience, she sees it as just another dangerous trend among teenagers. She also mentions other examples like #EatSomeForks and #RobAFootLocker.  Let's hope that Shelby's story resonates with her peers and encourages them to think twice before attempting this dangerous trend.”X†  Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania Senator, made an official proclamation today, declaring his entry into the 2020 Presidential race. Santorum expressed his belief that Washington is in dire need of repair and shared his innovative ideas for fixing it. Addressing a small group of supporters and available family members at a cozy rally in Des Moines, Santorum confidently stated, "Once the American people hear my ideas, there will be no stopping me. I am determined to win this race!"  Despite launching his campaign in Iowa, a state where the next Presidential caucuses will not take place for another four years, Santorum brushed off suggestions that he was jumping in too early. When questioned about the timing, he retorted, "You'll have to take that up with Jesus Christ. He's the one who instructed me to do this."  The response to Santorum's announcement was somewhat subdued, with some individuals suggesting that he should continue running for President if it brings him happiness.

Following his contentious remark on halting tragedies, prominent members of Congress aligned with the pro-tragedy movement maintained a stoic silence, refusing to offer their applause. "I found it offensive and inappropriate," stated Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana). "If the President wishes to garner cooperation from Congress, he should abstain from employing divisive and inflammatory rhetoric against tragedies." The pro-tragedy lobby holds significant sway in Washington, expending millions annually to defeat politicians who oppose tragedies. Representative Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina), known for his staunch pro-tragedy voting record, also criticized the President's statement, accusing Obama of waging a war on tragedy. "If the President genuinely believes he can prevent more tragedies, he should be prepared for a battle," warned Rep. Wilson. "The American people's right to tragedies is safeguarded by the United States Constitution."”Xo  Millions of Americans across the nation experienced an unexpected bout of drowsiness on Wednesday night between 9 and 10:30 P.M. E.T., as reported by numerous individuals. This widespread phenomenon resulted in voters only being able to catch a glimpse of the first Presidential debate between former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama. According to those few who managed to stay awake, the debate has been deemed the most uneventful in American history. Moderator Jim Lehrer's request for silence from the audience proved unnecessary, as within minutes, most of them were seen with their heads slouched forward, with drool visibly hanging from their mouths.  Mr. Obama began the debate by adopting a high-risk strategy that appeared aimed at alienating a significant portion of the population â€“ the utilization of math and facts. However, his words seemed unlikely to deter many viewers, who quickly succumbed to the allure of slumber. Surprisingly, Mr. Romney's much-touted witty remarks were conspicuously absent, aside from a perplexing and unrelated attack on PBS's beloved character, Big Bird. The sole moment of excitement occurred at the debate's onset when Mr. Obama congratulated his wife, Michelle, on their twentieth wedding anniversary. In response, Mr. Romney quipped, "I disagree with your decision to marry Michelle. On Day One, I'll reverse it."”X·   Black Churches in the South Continue to Burn: A Sign of the Ongoing War on Christmas?  In recent years, a disturbing trend has emerged in the South - historically black churches are being intentionally set on fire. While some may dismiss this as hyperbolic, the evidence is difficult to ignore. From Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in North Carolina to Gods Power Church of Christ in Georgia, 2015 has witnessed multiple fires deliberately targeting predominantly black churches. This alarming pattern begs the question: is there a war on Christmas happening in our country?  The signs are hard to ignore. Cashiers have shifted from saying "Merry Christmas" to "Happy Holidays." Nativity scenes are vanishing from city halls. And now, churches that serve as places of worship for African-American communities are being set ablaze. The recent Starbucks red cup controversy also highlights the sensitivity surrounding the holiday season. These incidents, however, are not isolated. A closer look reveals that black churches have been targeted and burned for decades, long before the phrase "War on Christmas" entered our lexicon.  Moreover, just last month, the FBI apprehended two men who were planning to bomb a primarily black church. Such acts of hatred and violence should give pause to those who dismiss the notion of a war on Christmas as a mere right-wing talking point. While we acknowledge that not everyone celebrates Christmas, the extent to which these incidents are occurring raises concerns about the state of religious freedom and tolerance in our society.  As the holiday season approaches, it is essential to reflect on these troubling events. The dismissal of the War on Christmas as a partisan issue may be tempting, but the ongoing destruction of predominantly black churches demands a more serious examination. Perhaps it is time for society to reevaluate the significance of these acts and their implications for religious communities across the country.”Xá   In an escalating saga of uncertainty surrounding the unexplained absence of Kim Jong-un, the reclusive dictator of North Korea, the country's government released an official statement on Wednesday. The message, issued by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), sought to reassure its citizens by emphasizing the regime's formidable lineup of ruthless individuals. While offering no comment on Kim's whereabouts, the statement underscored that the creation of North Korea's authoritarian horror-drome is not solely the result of one man's efforts; rather, it has always been and will continue to be a collective endeavor.  Highlighting the nation's unique capacity for unpredictability and cruelty, the KCNA statement asserted that there are no fewer than twelve highly unstable individuals occupying the upper echelons of the government. These individuals possess the ability to imprison former lovers, execute relatives, or issue threats of annihilating the United States in a blazing inferno at a moment's notice. This roster of individuals, unparalleled by any other government, serves as a testament to North Korea's unwavering commitment to maintaining a level of mercurial brutality that surpasses that of any other nation on Earth.  "As North Koreans, you have come to expect a level of cruelty unmatched by any other country on the planet," the statement continued. "As your leaders, we promise that this will never change." Seeking to further allay the concerns of the North Korean people, the statement concluded with an audacious declaration of war against Mars.  While the statement provided little insight into the whereabouts of Kim Jong-un, it served as a stark reminder of the regime's determination to perpetuate its oppressive rule, regardless of the uncertainties surrounding its supreme leader. As the world speculates on the fate of Kim, North Korea's government, through its official channels, remains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining a culture of fear and brutality within its borders.”XÖ   In the vast landscape of dating apps, many have struggled to find their match.

  Scientists Propose New Terminology to Enhance Climate Change Concern Among Americans  A recent study conducted by the Yale Center on Climate Change Communication has shed light on the limited level of concern elicited by the term "climate change" among the American public. In response, leading scientists are now recommending the adoption of alternative terms that more effectively convey the urgency of the issue. These proposed terms include alarming phrases such as "You will be burnt to a crisp and die," "your cities will be ravaged by tsunamis and floods," and "earth will be a fiery hellhole incapable of supporting human life."  Scientists have largely welcomed these suggestions, with a notable preference for the term "your future will involve rowing a boat down a river of rotting corpses." Tracy Klugian, spokesperson for the newly renamed Yale Center for Oh My God Wake Up You Assholes, expressed that any of these proposed terms would better communicate the gravity of the situation.  The study's findings revealed that the current terminology surrounding climate change fails to instill the necessary level of concern among the American public. This is a critical issue, as public awareness and concern play a pivotal role in driving action to mitigate the effects of climate change.  As scientists grapple with the challenge of effectively communicating the urgency of this global crisis, it has become evident that alternative terminology is needed. The proposed terms aim to shock and awaken individuals to the imminent dangers that await if urgent action is not taken. By employing more alarming language, it is hoped that Americans will recognize the severity of the situation and be motivated to take action to address climate change.  The Yale Center's report highlights the importance of public perception and understanding in tackling climate change. It emphasizes the necessity of conveying the urgency and potential consequences of this crisis to mobilize individuals and communities towards adopting sustainable practices.  While the adoption of these new terms may face some resistance, scientists are hopeful that they will be more effective in capturing public attention and inspiring action. By provoking a visceral response, the hope is that Americans will no longer be able to ignore the pressing need for immediate action to prevent catastrophic outcomes.  In conclusion, the scientific community is advocating for a shift in terminology surrounding climate change in order to generate a greater sense of urgency among the American public. The proposed terms aim to shock and provoke individuals into recognizing the severity of the crisis at hand. By effectively communicating the potential consequences, it is hoped that these new terms will galvanize individuals and communities to take meaningful action to combat climate change.”Xn   In a bittersweet moment for the freshman class of House Republicans, disappointment washed over them as they realized their hopes of shutting down the government were not fulfilled on their first day in office. Freshman Rep. Byron Ernie (R-Kentucky) expressed the sentiment shared by his fellow Republicans, stating, "We were all like, O.K., we were sworn in, let's shut this thing down." The disappointment was palpable as they watched the government continue to operate.  Rep. Ernie admitted that their aspirations for engineering a government shutdown on their very first day may have been overly optimistic. However, he emphasized that bringing the government to a standstill was a fundamental reason they joined the Republican party. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) responded to the ambitious goals of the high-spirited Republican freshmen with a chuckle, saying, "I remember what it was like to be young and full of big ideas about crippling our historic institutions for no discernible reason whatsoever. There's nothing like your first time." Cantor humorously compared the freshmen to children wanting to close down a candy store.  Despite the disappointment of their initial day, Rep. Ernie eagerly looked forward to the day when he and his fellow Republican freshmen would participate in their first government shutdown. He likened the experience to playing basketball in the same arena as Michael Jordan. "We'll be paralyzing the government in the same building where John Boehner and Eric Cantor did it, and Newt Gingrich before them," he exclaimed.  The enthusiasm and determination of these Republican newcomers were unmistakable as they navigated the complexities of their new roles in Congress. While their aspirations may have been dashed on their first day, they remained steadfast in their mission to challenge the status quo and make their mark on American politics.”XÞ  Spending cuts imposed by the sequester could hinder the United States' ability to engage in military invasions without any valid reason, cautioned a Pentagon spokesperson on Tuesday. This somber evaluation from the Pentagon arrives amidst widespread concerns that the nation's capacity to wage entirely optional wars based on fabricated pretexts may be at risk. Historically, the United States has remained prepared and capable of pouring billions of dollars into military campaigns lacking clear rationale or well-defined objectives, stated spokesperson Harland Dorrinson. "Our ability to engage in war without any genuine motive is now in jeopardy." Previously, Dorrinson indicated, the Pentagon had the resources to pursue three meaningless and completely random wars simultaneously, but now we are reducing that number to two during our planning sessions. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) concurred with the catastrophic consequences of the Pentagon cuts, asserting, "The United States' capability to assert its military dominance in an arbitrary and completely unpredictable manner must never be compromised." The impact of these cuts is already palpable at the Pentagon, which recently cancelled an order for a pen worth nine thousand dollars.”X!  In a bold attempt to address the pressing immigration crisis, Texas Governor Rick Perry made an audacious move on Thursday by deploying the Dallas Cowboys to the United States border with Mexico. Capitalizing on a photo opportunity with the renowned football team and a bevy of their cheerleaders, Perry elucidated the reasoning behind his latest decision. "Those who dare to cross our borders unlawfully shall confront the might and fury of America's Team," he proclaimed. Critics swiftly dismissed this move as mere political theater, questioning the actual purpose of the Cowboys' presence at the border. Doubts also arose regarding the efficacy of the football team in curtailing illegal immigration, given their dismal defensive performance, ranking at the bottom of the National Football League.”X

  Telecommuters Embrace Unconventional Perks of Working from Home  In the comfort of their own homes, telecommuters have unleashed their true selves, reveling in the freedom that comes with a lack of dress code and societal expectations. Shedding not only their shirts and ties but also their inhibitions, they lounge the day away, basking in the liberty of being just muscles and bones.  With no prying eyes or judgmental colleagues, telecommuters have found solace in expressing their unfiltered thoughts. Liberated by their solitude, they unabashedly exclaim their desires to push buses teeming with canines into nearby lakes. The absence of coworkers has given them the license to let their imaginations run wild, unencumbered by societal norms.  In the absence of office scrutiny, personal hygiene has taken a backseat for these remote workers. The luxury of no longer having to impress coworkers or superiors has led some to indulge in a unique bathing experience - the reverse shower. Here, the unmentionable filth sprays up from the drain, offering an unconventional yet strangely satisfying cleansing ritual.  Boundaries are blurred when working from home, offering opportunities for unconventional interactions. In a bold move, some telecommuters have even kissed the parents of their company's CEO, an act that would be unthinkable in a traditional office setting. Such audacity is a testament to the freedom that working remotely provides.  The daily grind of commuting becomes a thing of the past for those embracing the telecommuting lifestyle. No longer trapped in traffic or burdened by rising fuel costs, telecommuters relish in the ability to take matters into their own hands. With chainsaws in hand, they gleefully slice their cars into tiny, unrecognizable fragments of metal, bidding farewell to the hassles of commuting once and for all.  Yet, despite the many freedoms and eccentricities that come with working remotely, telecommuters are not immune to the pangs of loneliness. Seeking companionship, they turn to an unconventional solution - sculpting coworkers out of marble. The act of chiseling away at stone provides a semblance of human connection, reminding them of the camaraderie they once shared in physical office spaces.  Amidst all the indulgent activities, it is important not to forget the crux of their existence - work. Telecommuters may relish in the peculiarities of their remote lifestyle, but deep down, they harbor a secret pleasure: the satisfaction of productivity. Despite the unconventional perks, the desire to accomplish”XK   China Mourns the Loss of Hollywood Legend Sean Penn  Yesterday, China witnessed a day filled with deep emotions as the People's Liberation Army hosted a national military funeral to bid farewell to renowned actor Sean Penn. The occasion was marked by solemnity and introspection, prompting Chinese individuals from all corners of the nation to take the day off work and participate in the numerous intricate ceremonies, offering their final respects to the Hollywood icon. Throughout major Chinese cities, somber military processions took place, featuring hundreds of thousands of soldiers marching in perfect synchronization. Reports indicate that citizens lined the streets, showering the marching soldiers with flowers, tears streaming down their faces, and clutching cherished photographs of Sean Penn close to their hearts. Though unable to recover Penn's body, the Chinese military created a lifelike mannequin, placing it within an opulent ivory casket. President Xi Jinping himself, visibly overcome with grief, stepped forward to drape a Chinese flag over the casket. "From 'Carlito's Way' to 'Milk,' Sean Penn's artistry and contributions have deeply touched our souls and enriched our lives," President Xi expressed in a statement broadcasted nationally on every major Chinese news outlet. "We shall forever remember Sean Penn, and his legacy will endure eternally within the hearts and minds of the People's Republic of China." The military band then played the Chinese national anthem as a select group of soldiers gently lowered the casket into a five-story mausoleum, within the Sean Penn shrine. Today, the Chinese people have resumed their work routines, yet a rotation of armed guards will forever maintain a 24-hour vigil over Sean Penn's mausoleum. This poignant gesture serves as a fitting tribute to an artist whose creations held immense power.”Xð   Millions of Tea Party supporters embarked on a hasty exodus from the United States in the early morning hours today, driven by a shared desire for the American dream of freedom from health care. Among them was Harland Dorrinson, a 47-year-old tire salesman from Lexington, Kentucky, who swiftly packed up his family and their belongings into his Chevy Suburban just hours before the health-insurance exchanges opened. Dorrinson had one goal in mind: to escape from the clutches of Obamacare.  Dorrinson, echoing the sentiment of many Tea Partiers, explained, "My father and my grandfather didn't have health care, and I won't allow my children to have it either." However, his hopes were dashed when, after a grueling ten-hour drive to the Canadian border, he discovered that America's northern neighbor had been under the spell of health care for decades. Recounting his disappointment, Dorrinson shared, "The border guard seemed unfazed when he informed me, as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world. It's as if he has been indoctrinated by the notion of health care."  Undeterred, Dorrinson joined a procession of Tea Party vehicles headed south to Mexico, convinced that although the country may have its challenges with drug cartels and narcoterrorism, at least health care had been kept at bay. It was only halfway to the southern border that Dorrinson learned, through the Tea Party grapevine, that Mexico also had a public health care system. This revelation left him disheartened, especially since he had previously considered fleeing to countries like Great Britain, Japan, Turkey, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, and Slovenia, all of which also embraced public health care.  Nevertheless, Dorrinson remained resolute and began exploring the possibility of relocating to countries like Chad and North Korea. He expressed astonishment at a world seemingly overrun by health care, but he remains proud to be an American, acknowledging that the United States is one of the last countries on earth to adopt such a system.”X    In a groundbreaking advancement in genetic engineering, scientists from Virginia Tech have unveiled an innovative solution to food production. By merging various plants and animals together, they have created a remarkable creature known as a foodnode. This extraordinary breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize farming practices and eliminate the need for vast expanses of land dedicated to crops and livestock.  Dr. David Hausler, a prominent researcher from Virginia Tech's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, expressed his belief that foodnodes could eventually supplant current farming methods. He emphasized the wastage of extensive land resources and highlighted the versatility of these novel animals, which can produce a wide array of consumables such as beef, chicken meat, milk, grain, and eggs.  The latest achievement in this field involves the creation of a foodnode capable of yielding pork membrane from its rear. This development is poised to transform American agriculture, as it opens up new possibilities for farmers and consumers alike. Excitingly, the potential applications of foodnodes extend beyond meat-based products, ensuring that even vegetarians can benefit. By reaching inside the foodnode's orifices, individuals can extract tumors that represent various fruits and vegetables. Simply remove the lump, peel off the skin, and a bounty of produce awaits, ranging from apples to broccoli.  While the current lifespan of foodnodes is limited to approximately two minutes, scientists are confident that these remarkable creatures will soon alter the landscape of food production and consumption in the United States. The rapid progress in this field suggests that it is only a matter of time before foodnodes become a staple in our quest for sustainable and efficient food production.”X¥   In what Secretary of State John Kerry hailed as a remarkable achievement in foreign policy, the United States announced on Tuesday that it had successfully located a moderate Syrian rebel. While Secretary Kerry did not disclose the specific methods employed to track down the rebel, he emphasized that this breakthrough was the culmination of an extensive and protracted effort. The Secretary of State asserted that the individual in question had undergone a thorough vetting process and had been deemed moderately rebellious. According to Kerry, this rebel is precisely the kind of person with whom the United States can establish a productive partnership. Kerry also disclosed that significant funds, reaching several million dollars, would be allocated towards arming and training this rebel in the coming days and weeks.  Secretary Kerry further declared that the successful identification of a moderate Syrian rebel by the U.S. government represented a major triumph, effectively rebutting critics of the nation's strategy in Iraq and Syria. In a confident tone, Kerry addressed those who had been skeptical about the existence of moderate Syrian rebels, stating, "To all of the naysayers who have been arguing that there are no moderate Syrian rebels, I am here today to say that we have found one. And if we have found one, that means that there must be others out there." This statement underscored the significance of this discovery and the potential it holds for future collaborations.  With this development, the United States aims to bolster its efforts in the region and expand its network of alliances among Syrian rebels. The discovery of this moderate figure serves as a testament to the resourcefulness and persistence of American diplomats and intelligence agencies. As the United States continues to navigate the complexities of the Syrian conflict, this breakthrough may serve as a turning point, offering hope for a viable path forward.”Xþ  Celebrities often surprise us with their acts of kindness, and Jon Hamm certainly did not disappoint this past weekend. When a stranded whale washed up on a Malibu beach, the renowned Mad Men star went above and beyond to help the struggling creature, even making crepes for it. The scene was nothing short of remarkable.  Eyewitnesses were at a loss for what to do when they discovered the once-majestic ocean dweller stranded on the beach. But before anyone could come to a consensus, Jon Hamm appeared, ready to lend a helping hand. Despite the challenging conditions posed by crashing waves, the Golden Globe winner fearlessly heated up a crepe pan on the spot. He valiantly used his body to shield the pan from the cold water, despite the discomfort it caused him. Hamm's determination and compassion were truly awe-inspiring.  Preparedness was another one of Hamm's virtues. He laid out a wide array of crepe ingredients, ranging from freshly grown peppers and mushrooms to the most succulent strawberries one could imagine. It is worth noting that Hamm, despite lacking formal culinary training, managed to create a near-perfect strawberry and Nutella crepe. However, realizing that the whale's appetite surpassed that of a human, Hamm selflessly spent the next five hours tirelessly making delicious crepes to satiate the creature's hunger.  As the sun began to set, Hamm meticulously packed up his cooking station and properly disposed of his garbage. Meanwhile, a team of scientists had gathered to assist in pushing the whale back into the ocean. They expressed their gratitude to Hamm for his tremendous efforts. Yet, true to his humble nature, Hamm refused to take any credit. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that he is the epitome of kindness, making him the kindest man alive.”X  Prepare to be amazed! Scientists at the renowned San Diego Zoo have achieved a remarkable feat that will surely leave you in awe. After dedicating more than three years to their groundbreaking research with a 270-pound gorilla named Sampson, these accomplished researchers have announced a major breakthrough. Sampson is now capable of expressing more than 1,500 signs of modified sign language, and astonishingly, he has even revealed his homosexuality to his father. This is a triumph for scientific progress!   While it is not uncommon for gorillas to grasp basic words such as "ball" or "lettuce," Sampson's linguistic abilities are truly extraordinary. He has surpassed these limited skills and can now communicate through complete sentences, articulating his innermost thoughts and feelings, including the truth about his sexuality to his father. The researchers observed this remarkable event while Sampson and his father, Max, were together in their enclosure. As other gorillas in the facility watched eagerly, Sampson signed his very first sentence: "Me gorilla love man gorilla." This achievement is simply mind-blowing!  Although Max, his father, is unable to comprehend sign language, the researchers are filled with enthusiasm to continue their work with him. Their hope is that one day, Max may understand the profound message Sampson has communicated. But for now, this scientific breakthrough has enabled a highly intelligent young gorilla to express his true identity to his father. What an extraordinary accomplishment!”Xˆ  With Hurricane Isaac barreling toward the site of the 2012 Republican National Convention, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called for a swift government response in the form of emergency tax cuts. Highlighting the potential devastation of this powerful storm, Mr. Romney argued that it would be inhumane to burden individuals with higher taxes, particularly if their second and third homes were destroyed.   Joining in Mr. Romney's call for tax relief, his running mate, Vice-Presidential pick Paul Ryan, expressed satisfaction with his previous vote to cut emergency relief funding. Ryan emphasized the importance of limiting the role of big government in hurricane response efforts. According to Ryan, the federal government's usual approach of providing food, water, and medical supplies would be misguided in this situation. Instead, he advocated for vouchers as the appropriate solution.”Xj  Unforgettable Heartbreak: A Cinematic Twist on Tragic Demises  In the annals of film history, few scenes have left such an indelible mark on viewers as the heart-wrenching moment when Jack, lifeless and cold, slipped away from Rose in the iconic movie Titanic.

Today, scholars pointed out that the Church of England's recognition of gender equality places it centuries ahead of Scalia's thinking. Davis Logsdon, a respected professor of religion at the University of Minnesota, lauded the Church's remarkable achievement in embracing such a stance, particularly given Scalia's birth in 1936 and the Church's origins in the late fifth century. However, Dr. Carol Foyler, a history professor at the University of Sussex, disputed Logsdon's assessment, stating that she dates the Church's establishment to 1534 when it was officially recognized under Henry VIII. Regardless of whether the Church is fourteen or five centuries old, it is undeniably more modern in its views than Scalia. In response to the controversy, Justice Scalia appeared to dismiss the matter, issuing a brief official statement on Monday afternoon. "I do not keep up with the goings-on of every newfangled institution," he remarked.”Xü  In a surprising turn of events, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie held an impromptu press conference today to disclose a shocking revelation - he had only just discovered his own position as the governor of the state in the past seventy-two hours. Clearly taken aback, Christie addressed a room full of reporters, his astonishment evident. "Unbeknownst to me, some people I thought I could trust were secretly working to elect me governor of this state," he disclosed.  In an effort to rectify the situation, the visibly stunned Christie wasted no time in taking swift action. "I have acted swiftly and fired them all," he stated, referring to the individuals involved in the scheme. However, he remained resolute, warning that if he uncovers any additional conspirators, he would "deal with them accordingly."  The governor faced difficulty in explaining how he could have remained oblivious to his own status as governor for nearly a decade, a position he has held since 2010. "I guess I'm just not much of a detail person," Christie admitted. "People think I'm a micromanager, but I'm not. If a bunch of people are going behind my back and plotting to make me the governor, that's not the kind of thing I pick up on."  Reflecting on his emotional response to the news, Christie expressed a mixture of anger, embarrassment, and humiliation. However, sadness seemed to dominate his sentiments. "It's sad that this was allowed to happen," he lamented. "It's a sad situation for me and for New Jersey."  As Christie grapples with the implications of this unexpected revelation, the impact on his political career and the state he leads remains uncertain. One thing is clear though, the governor's shock and disappointment reverberate through the halls of New Jersey's political landscape.”X‡  "ClickHole to Host Hot Mr. Online, the First International Beauty Pageant on the World Wide Web"  In an effort to uncover the most captivating persona in the virtual realm, ClickHole is proud to announce the launch of Hot Mr. Online - a groundbreaking beauty pageant taking place entirely on the World Wide Web.

However, the renowned toy brand, Mattel, has recently taken a significant step forward in addressing this issue. Their latest creation, the Female Interim CEO Barbie, is a refreshing departure from the norm, signaling a positive change in the company's approach.  Dressed impeccably in designer black pants, heels, and a tailored blazer, the Female Interim CEO Barbie exudes class and confidence. She represents a powerful figure, ready to take on the most influential role in the company while they search for new permanent leadership. Unlike previous iterations, this Barbie emphasizes substance over appearance. She embodies the qualities of a smart and savvy businesswoman, setting an example for young girls that goes beyond superficial beauty.  Mattel spokesperson Laura Masterson explained, "When we conceived this concept, our goal was to show girls that they can achieve anything. With the Female Interim CEO Barbie, we aim to connect girls with a role model who possesses the vision and drive necessary to excel in a high-profile position during a transition period of six or seven months." This doll serves as a reminder that girls can aspire to become senior vice presidents or CEOs, and that these roles are not limited to men.  Finally, parents can purchase a Barbie doll without feeling guilty. The Female Interim CEO Barbie allows girls to learn through play that they have the potential to rise to the top of their chosen fields and navigate temporary leadership positions. While it remains to be seen if this move will appease the brand's critics, it is undoubtedly encouraging to witness Mattel invest in providing young girls with examples of teamwork and the importance of temporary leadership.  In conclusion, Mattel's Female Interim CEO Barbie breaks free from the stereotypes that have plagued Barbie dolls for years. This new addition to the Barbie line empowers young girls, offering them a role model who defies gender norms and highlights the significance of temporary leadership. This step forward is truly inspiring and marks a positive change in the toy industry.”X
	  Statue of Liberty, Finally Reunited With Her Companion, Completes the Iconic Duo  For more than a century, the Statue of Liberty has stood as a beacon of hope for immigrants arriving in the land of opportunity. A symbol of a better life and the American dream, Lady Liberty has always been a powerful representation of freedom. However, her story has always been incomplete. That is, until now. After an arduous wait of more than 130 years, France has finally fulfilled its promise and sent America the Statue of Liberty's long-awaited companion. The significance of this moment cannot be overstated.  Originally, France had intended to build both statues in 1875, but due to budget constraints, only one could be completed. Last year, however, the French government resurrected the plans and undertook the construction of the accompanying statue. Now, Liberty's Husband has arrived in America, reuniting the couple in a historic moment that fills our hearts with joy and excitement. The perfect union of these two statues is a sight to behold.  Crafted entirely of copper and steel, Liberty's Husband exudes a neoclassical beauty, with intricate details that pay homage to ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy. His flowing robes and meticulously groomed beard evoke a sense of timeless wisdom and strength. In his right hand, he holds a spear, symbolizing his unwavering commitment to safeguarding freedom and his beloved wife from any threat. Standing 10 feet shorter than the Statue of Liberty, this new addition further enriches the Manhattan harbor, which had long yearned for the presence of Lady Liberty's companion.  Now, both New Yorkers and tourists alike can revel in the magnificent sight of these wedded guardians, standing tall and watchful, their love and devotion palpable. The completion of this iconic duo is a testament to the enduring bond between our nations and a reminder of the shared values we hold dear.  We extend our heartfelt gratitude to France for honoring their promise and delivering this long-awaited gift. Our new statue fills us with a sense of pride, and we are overjoyed that Lady Liberty has finally found her partner. Together, they embody the spirit of freedom and serve as a reminder of the limitless possibilities that await those who seek a better life in America.”•W      Xš  Becoming a star in the world of hip-hop requires not only talent, but also earning respect. And sometimes, earning respect means engaging in epic feuds with those who disrespect you. Here, we take a look at some of the most legendary hip-hop feuds of all time.  1. 50 Cent and Ja Rule The feud between these two hip-hop moguls traces back to the early 2000s when Ja Rule allegedly borrowed 50 Cent's DVD of the movie "The Shawshank Redemption" and failed to return it. While Ja Rule claims to have no recollection of this, 50 Cent insists that he lent it to him. In his 2002 single "Wanksta," 50 Cent even implored Ja Rule to at least search for the DVD. This disagreement set the stage for a fierce rivalry.  2. Diddy and Suge Knight The East Coast vs. West Coast beef has a long history, and Diddy and Suge Knight played a significant role in it. Born on the same day but on opposite sides of the country, these two hip-hop figures entered the world and immediately embarked on a collision course. They met in a field in Nebraska, where they engaged in a physical altercation shortly after leaving the hospital. Their rivalry has persisted for decades.  3. Nicki Minaj and Lil Kim In her quest to establish herself as an emerging artist, Nicki Minaj took a lyrical jab at Lil Kim on her debut album, suggesting that Lil Kim had been swallowed by a pelican. This diss infuriated Lil Kim, who retaliated with a brutal track insinuating that Nicki Minaj suffered the same fate. Not one to back down, Minaj responded by dedicating an entire album to the concept of Lil Kim being swallowed by a pelican, with references to it in every song. The question remains: how will Lil Kim respond to this latest provocation?  4. T.I. and Ludacris These two prominent rappers from Atlanta have engaged in fierce competition for much of their careers. However, in a surprising turn of events, they buried the hatchet in 2007 and collaborated on a track that showcased their newfound respect for one another. T.I. rhymed Ludacris with "phenomenal kiss," while Ludacris returned the favor by rhyming T.I. with "great guy." This unexpected alliance marked the end of their feud.  5. Eminem and Several Unruly Swans In a”X‚  In a notable indication of a shifting global sentiment towards the United States, a recent survey reveals that the nation has become the object of worldwide mockery for reasons other than its gun laws. The University of Minnesota's Opinion Research Institute conducted the survey, which found that while America's gun laws used to be the subject of widespread derision, they now rank a distant second in terms of international ridicule. Surprisingly, the U.S. Congress's stance on climate change, which had previously been a leading cause for the nation being the butt of jokes, also fell far behind. Davis Logsdon, the supervisor of the poll conducted by the University of Minnesota, expressed surprise at the unanimity of foreign respondents when asked about the current reason that makes the United States the laughingstock of the world. "In all the years we've conducted this survey, we have never witnessed ninety-four percent of respondents giving the same response," he stated. Logsdon further noted that a significant majority of those surveyed were unable to control their laughter long enough to provide a coherent explanation for their choice.”X@  Residents of the city of Austin find themselves trapped within the confines of the state of Texas, a predicament that locals describe as dire. Austin, known for its semi-autonomous status and the freedom it afforded its inhabitants to host cultural events without interference from neighboring areas, now faces a potential end to its cherished liberties. Disturbingly, citizens report extremists within their city limits have seized control of the Capitol Building and established a militant regime, subjecting residents to their dominion. As the situation worsens, Austin has urgently called upon the U.S. military for assistance, particularly considering the military exercises scheduled to take place in Texas this July. The city hopes that the United States will employ its military power to liberate this isolated municipality and pave the way for its independence, akin to the establishment of Kurdistan. However, as residents of this besieged city eagerly anticipate military aid, their desperation continues to grow. In the poignant words of one resident, "We feel so alone here."”X„  In a surprising turn of events, Queen Elizabeth II of Britain wasted no time in expressing her disappointment towards New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for his lack of courage in legalizing gay marriage. The monarch's scathing criticism left onlookers in awe, as they were unaware of her close attention to Gov. Christie's stance on this issue. "I don't like to speak ill of others," the Queen remarked, "but as the leader of a monarchy that dates back to the ninth century, it appears I am more progressive than Chris Christie." Her initial attack left observers stunned, but she did not hold back, continuing to dismantle Gov. Christie's position. "I understand that he must cater to the extreme right-wing faction of his party," she stated, "but the truth is, he is not as forward-thinking as an eighty-seven-year-old woman who wears a crown on her head. It's truly pathetic." When asked if she had any advice for Gov. Christie, Elizabeth responded bluntly, "Just sign the damn bill, Chris." A reporter also inquired about the upcoming royal birth, to which the Queen replied, "To be honest, I'm just relieved the child isn't being born in New Jersey."”X5  In a surprising turn of events, a group of devoted Cleveland Browns fans has made a formal application to move their beloved N.F.L. franchise to Los Angeles, just two days after the team concluded yet another disappointing season. What sets this application apart from others vying for relocation to L.A., such as the St. Louis Rams, the San Diego Chargers, and the Oakland Raiders, is that it is believed to be the only one entirely submitted by fans.  Jimmy Haslam, the Browns owner, expressed his astonishment at the fans' unilateral relocation attempt. "Obviously, being an N.F.L. owner has been something of a steep learning curve for me," he admitted. "I was completely unaware that our city's fans had the power to move the team."  Butch Rydzewski, the mastermind behind this audacious relocation effort, believes that Los Angeles is the perfect destination for the team. "It's two thousand miles away and a place most of us have no intention of ever visiting," Rydzewski explained. In addition to relocating the team, he stated that Browns fans were taking further measures to ensure the team never returns. "We are actively lobbying the city council to demolish FirstEnergy Stadium," Rydzewski revealed. "Only then can the healing process truly begin."  While Cleveland fans forge ahead with their relocation plan, officials in Los Angeles are already taking steps to prevent the Browns from moving to their city. In a surprising move, they have even filed a restraining order against Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, indicating their resistance to the team's potential arrival.”X  Edward Snowden surprised a packed crowd at this year's SXSW with an impromptu performance of four songs from his newly released album, Edward. The audience, who had gathered to hear Snowden discuss the N.S.A. and government surveillance, were instead treated to the first-ever live performance of his music. Snowden expressed his gratitude to his fans, stating, "I made this music for you," and brushed off any criticism from detractors.  Opinions among listeners were divided regarding the quality of Snowden's eclectic four-song set, which encompassed various musical genres from alt-country to dubstep. Music critic Tracy Klugian was effusive in her praise, hailing Snowden as the most thrilling new artist to emerge from SXSW in recent memory. She drew comparisons to the impact Conor Oberst had on her when she first heard his music. Klugian did acknowledge that not every song resonated, stating, "Obviously, the duet with Kesha was a misstep, but I applaud his efforts."  However, music journalist Harland Dorrinson was less impressed, claiming that Snowden's music failed to offer anything groundbreaking. Dorrinson remarked, "Snowden said it was new music, but I didn't hear anything new. It sounds like he's been heavily influenced by Arcade Fire, in addition to his N.S.A. documents."  After his performance, Snowden disappointed some members of the audience by refusing to delve into discussions about government surveillance. He clarified, "Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of the whistle-blowing I did, but today I just want to focus on my music."”Xe  Americans remain deeply divided over which wild animal they would prefer to see Congress mauled by, as the partial government shutdown enters its twelfth day, according to a recent poll. The survey, released today, reveals that a majority of Americans would relish the sight of Congress being torn apart by a ferocious bear. However, there is disagreement as to which bear species would be most suitable for this task. Grizzly bears received the highest job-approval rating, followed by polar bears, with black bears ranking a distant third.  Nevertheless, the poll also indicated strong support for the idea of Congress being attacked by a pack of rapacious animals. Among the respondents, rabid hyenas emerged as the first choice, followed by feral dogs and cats. While bloodthirsty mammals were frequently cited as the preferred animals to eviscerate Congress, there was significant backing for an alternative scenario involving Congress being consumed by a swarm of predatory insects.  Surprisingly, fifteen percent of those surveyed strongly agreed with the statement that being torn limb from limb by a grizzly bear or devoured by a pack of rabid hyenas would be too lenient for Congress. These individuals believed that Congress should be slowly eaten by a colony of hungry fire ants. The idea of fire ants consuming Congress was described as "amazing" by these respondents.”Xà  Habitat for Humanity, the renowned nonprofit organization dedicated to improving living conditions worldwide, has embarked on an ambitious mission to tackle the pressing issue of affordable housing in the United States. Building on their decades-long commitment to this cause, the charity has now introduced a groundbreaking initiative that involves airdropping houses into some of the most impoverished areas of the country. This audacious endeavor, which began with a successful pilot program in western Kentucky last March, has the potential to revolutionize the world of affordable housing.  During the eight-day pilot program, Habitat for Humanity's fleet of specially equipped C-130 cargo planes dispersed an astounding 740 tons of fully furnished, energy-efficient homes from an altitude of 12,000 feet. The resounding success of this endeavor underscored the immense potential of the program and paved the way for its nationwide rollout in mid-January. Since then, an outpouring of support has been witnessed, with thousands of volunteers offering their time and efforts to construct the houses required for the initiative.  The impact of this initiative can already be seen in various parts of the country. In Cincinnati's Eden Park, a 1,000-square-foot single-family ranch home was successfully delivered, while in Ames, Iowa, a split-level Craftsman house found its resting place just east of a water treatment plant. Witnessing the bay doors open and observing these houses hurtle off the loading ramp has been a truly awe-inspiring experience for volunteers like Alex Conroy, who dedicated their weekends to rigging up the houses and delivering them to their designated drop zones. Their hard work and dedication are evident in the transformative effect these houses have on neighborhoods and the lives of those who inhabit them.  The impact of Habitat for Humanity's efforts cannot be overstated. By addressing the urgent need for affordable housing in a bold and innovative manner, this organization and its dedicated volunteers are effecting positive change on a monumental scale. The initiative's success is a testament to the commitment and selflessness of these heroes, who have stepped up to make a significant difference in the lives of those in need.”Xª  In a concerning twist for the Republican campaign, a recent poll conducted among likely voters revealed that presidential nominee Mitt Romney is lagging significantly behind an unexpected opponent - the empty chair that Clint Eastwood conversed with on stage during the Republican National Convention in Tampa. When asked to determine who exhibits a greater concern for individuals akin to themselves, a mere thirty-seven percent of respondents chose Romney, while a majority of fifty-two percent favored the chair. These poll figures mark the most substantial surge in popularity for an inanimate entity following a party convention since the nomination of Michael Dukakis in 1988.”X%  Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, unveiled an audacious new plan today aimed at rejuvenating the party. In a press conference, Priebus expressed the need for Republicans to adopt a more inclusive approach, reaching out to individuals with differing beliefs, such as those who embrace math and science. Following a disappointing outcome in Tuesday's election, Priebus emphasized the urgency for Republicans to exhibit greater tolerance towards those who lead a "math-and-science lifestyle." "Just because we don't subscribe to these ideas doesn't mean we cannot coexist harmoniously with those who do," he stated. The objective is to convey a resounding message: supporters of math and science are just as American as anyone else.  In a significant departure from previous electoral strategies, Priebus revealed that the Republican Party is even contemplating the possibility of appealing to women. "I recently came across a statistic indicating that women constitute as much as fifty-one percent of the population," he astonishingly shared. While this figure struck Priebus as remarkably high, he humorously suggested that one of the party's newly recruited math Republicans could verify its accuracy.  Priebus's remarks represent a bold shift in strategy for the Republican Party, which has historically leaned towards a more conservative base. By embracing a big tent approach and making efforts to broaden their appeal, Republicans aim to revitalize their political fortunes and forge stronger connections with a diverse range of voters.”X¨  In a groundbreaking move, the National Rifle Association (N.R.A.) has called for a sweeping ban on movies, asserting that they are the leading cause of violence in America. Tracy Klugian, an authoritative spokesperson for the influential gun-lobbying organization, emphasized that the N.R.A. could no longer passively observe movies destroying the very fabric of our society. Klugian further stated that the N.R.A. would utilize funds from its influential PAC, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund, to support politicians who advocate for a prohibition on filmed entertainment.  Following the N.R.A.'s announcement, politicians from both sides of the political spectrum promptly applauded the organization for addressing the long-overdue need for movie regulation. Speaker of the House, John Boehner, expressed his support, firmly stating, "It is time for us to stop the madness." Boehner proposed legislation that would enforce a two-year waiting period and background checks before individuals are allowed to view Hollywood releases. Shortly thereafter, the White House responded, deeming the Speaker's proposal a promising initial step, but contending that Congress must critically evaluate whether superhero costumes and masks should remain legal.  Overall, Klugian expressed cautious optimism that the N.R.A.'s call for new legislation would be heeded, as their message appears to be gaining traction: Guns do not kill people; movies kill people.”Xù	  President Obama Faces Criticism for Addressing Extremist Group  President Obama has ignited controversy with his choice to engage with a group that has witnessed a surge in extremist influence in recent years. The appropriateness of the President's decision to address such a group has come under scrutiny, particularly due to its history of issuing threats against the United States government. In 2013, for instance, these extremists even went as far as threatening to bring the entire federal government to a halt unless their demands were met. Despite mounting concerns, the White House came to the President's defense on Tuesday, emphasizing that the Administration has previously initiated dialogues with both Iran and North Korea.  The decision to engage with this extremist group has raised eyebrows among critics, who argue that it may only serve to legitimize their radical views. Critics contend that providing a platform for an organization that has shown a willingness to employ threats against the government could potentially embolden them further. Concerns over the potential consequences of such engagement have been heightened as the group's influence grows within the organization.  On Tuesday afternoon, the White House addressed the mounting criticism, asserting that their decision to engage with this extremist group was consistent with their strategy of initiating dialogues with other nations, including Iran and North Korea. The Administration defended its approach, stating that it believes in the power of dialogue to foster understanding and potentially resolve conflicts.  The President's decision to engage with this extremist group comes at a time when domestic extremism has come under increased scrutiny. The rise of extremist ideologies within the country has sparked concerns over the potential for violence and disruption. Critics argue that engaging with such groups without clear mechanisms to address their radicalization and violent tendencies may not only be ineffective but also risk legitimizing their actions.  As the President moves forward with his decision to address this controversial group, the debate over the appropriateness and potential consequences of engaging with extremists continues to unfold. Critics argue that the decision could inadvertently lend credibility to an organization that has shown a willingness to employ threats against the government. Meanwhile, the White House maintains that dialogue remains an essential tool in resolving conflicts, even with those who hold extreme views.”X-   In a surprising move, Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) announced today his plans to file a lawsuit against President Obama, accusing him of violating the United States Constitution by actually getting things done. During a press conference, Boehner expressed his belief that the American people were guaranteed a government that would remain inactive and free from any kind of productivity.  Boehner did not hold back in his criticism of the President, accusing him of repeatedly breaking this sacred trust. He condemned Obama's persistent determination to accomplish tasks, labeling it as outrageous. The Speaker stated that his lawsuit aimed to restore the long-standing tradition of inaction and inertia that have come to define American democracy.  While acknowledging that suing the President was an extreme measure, Boehner defended his decision, claiming that he had exhausted all other options to prevent Obama from achieving anything. With a resolute tone, he emphasized that his lawsuit would send a powerful message to the President, warning him of dire consequences if he continued to stubbornly take actions that resulted in tangible outcomes.  Boehner's unconventional approach has sparked intense debate among lawmakers and political pundits. Critics argue that it reflects a growing partisan divide and a lack of willingness to find common ground. Supporters, on the other hand, applaud Boehner's commitment to protecting the principles they believe underpin the American system of governance.  As this lawsuit unfolds, it remains to be seen how the courts will interpret Boehner's argument that accomplishing tasks is a violation of the United States Constitution. The outcome will undoubtedly have significant implications for the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government.”X•  Major League Baseball Pays Tribute to Jackie Robinson with a Historic Gesture  Major League Baseball (MLB) is set to honor the legendary Jackie Robinson, a trailblazer who broke baseball's color barrier and left an indelible mark on the sport. In a remarkable tribute, MLB has invited Robinson's widow, Rachel Robinson, to throw out the first pitch at all 2,430 baseball games this season. This extraordinary gesture aims to celebrate the immense contributions of the late No. 42, who not only shattered racial barriers but was also widely renowned as one of the most talented players to grace the field.  Rachel Robinson, now 93 years old, has been instrumental in preserving her husband's legacy since his passing. However, this year, MLB is joining forces with her to share Jackie's message of equality by having Rachel perform the ceremonial first pitch at all 81 home games for each of the 30 teams. This heartfelt endeavor serves as a poignant reminder of Jackie Robinson's profound impact on the game and his enduring contributions to baseball.  Commencing yesterday and continuing until the final game of the regular season in October, Rachel's daily routine will involve throwing the first pitch at Yankee Stadium before journeying to Citi Field via the subway. Once she concludes her duties there, a private jet awaits her at LaGuardia Airport, ready to transport her to the next ballpark. Rachel's day will conclude at Dodger Stadium, over 12 hours later, where she will deliver her final pitch of the day, cheered on by an adoring crowd of 50,000 fans. With little respite, she will repeat this momentous task the next day, demonstrating her unwavering commitment to honoring her late husband's legacy.  Jackie Robinson, undoubtedly, would be filled with joy if he were alive today. This remarkable tribute surpasses his achievement of winning the 1949 National League Most Valuable Player Award. It stands as the greatest honor MLB has ever bestowed upon him, and it is a fitting testament to his immense contributions to the sport. Fans attending any Major League ballpark this season should prepare to witness an awe-inspiring event that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression.”X“  In a stunning turn of events, Senator Rand Paul's grip on the title of Kentucky's most embarrassing figure was abruptly severed on Tuesday night. For almost a decade, Paul had steadfastly upheld his reign, snatching the ignominious distinction from his fellow Senator Mitch McConnell in 2010. Prior to Paul's ascent, McConnell had held the unenviable title for an astonishing quarter of a century. However, this fall presented a formidable challenge to Paul's five-year reign, as he confronted the formidable presence of county clerk Kim Davis.

This lip-synching scandal, they argue, has cast a shadow over the President's second term.  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a prominent voice among the critics, asserted that BeyoncÃ©'s lip-synching has tarnished the commencement of President Obama's second term. "The only way President Obama can dispel this cloud is by resigning from office without delay," Senator Paul stated.  While many members of the media have placed blame on BeyoncÃ© for the lip-synching controversy, Senator Paul emphasized that ultimate responsibility lies with President Obama. "We must not forget that this occurred under President Obama's supervision," he said. The Senator further argued that the White House's silence on the matter has only fueled suspicions that the President is hiding something. "If BeyoncÃ© lip-synched the national anthem, how can we be certain that President Obama did not lip-sync his oath of office?" Senator Paul questioned. "If that is the case, he may not be legally President. However, just to err on the side of caution, he should resign regardless."  Senator Paul also criticized Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her testimony on the Benghazi attack during the Senate hearing earlier today. He dismissed her strategy of answering every question posed to her, asserting that her tactics failed to deceive anyone.  As this controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how President Obama will respond to these calls for his resignation.”X—   Credit Photograph by Aude Guerrucci/picture-alliance/dpa/AP  WASHINGTON â€” In a surprising turn of events, Republican front-runner Donald Trump experienced a significant drop in his poll numbers on Monday following an unexpected endorsement from President Barack Obama. This endorsement, which came on the eve of the crucial Super Tuesday primaries, caused widespread shock and speculation.  During a nationally televised address, President Obama offered a full-throated endorsement of Trump, praising his stance on issues such as immigration and religious tolerance. Contrary to media reports, the President claimed that he and Trump shared the same views on these crucial matters. As he pointed to a framed picture of Trump on his Oval Office desk, Obama declared, "In every way that matters, Donald and I are on exactly the same page." He concluded his endorsement with a strong plea to his supporters, stating, "If you love me, vote for Trump."  Following this stunning endorsement, multiple polls conducted among Republican voters indicated a significant drop in Trump's popularity, pushing him from first place to fifth place. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson emerged as the new front-runner, leading Trump by several points.  The news of the President's endorsement sparked widespread outrage among former Trump supporters across the nation. In various locations, these disgruntled supporters gathered to express their anger, burning signs, trucker hats, and other campaign paraphernalia at spontaneous bonfires. Harland Dorrinson, who had attended a massive Trump rally in Alabama just a day earlier, expressed a deep sense of betrayal, stating, "I guess when all is said and done, Donald Trump was just too good to be true."

Led by Professor Davis Logsdon from the prestigious University of Minnesota, these academics have published their research, providing substantial evidence that the bar has finally reached its lowest possible position. Logsdon confidently stated, "For those who believed there was still room for the bar to be lowered, our findings resoundingly contradict that assumption. The bar is now essentially flush with the ground."  Logsdon candidly acknowledged that he and his esteemed colleagues have faced criticism in the past for asserting that the bar could not descend any further. Notably, they faced scrutiny when they published a paper to that effect following the selection of the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee in 2008. "We got that one wrong," Logsdon admitted, conceding that the bar still had room to drop at that time. However, their latest research has put those doubts to rest, firmly establishing that the bar has reached its nadir.  Having settled the question of whether the bar can be further lowered, Logsdon and his team now plan to investigate whether there is anything left to scrape at the bottom of the barrel. Though their findings are preliminary, Logsdon shared, "It appears that the answer is no." With a sense of finality, it seems that the bar has hit rock bottom, leaving nothing more to be discovered.  The scholars' research, meticulously conducted and meticulously debated, marks a significant turning point in the study of the bar's descent. Their conclusions, which have been met with both anticipation and skepticism, are sure to reverberate throughout academia and beyond. The era of lowering the bar, it seems, has come to an end.”X  In a scathing rebuke of the incumbent residing in the prestigious White House, Dick Cheney, the former vice president, took aim at President Obama on Wednesday, asserting that Iraq would have been a picture of stability if he had remained at the helm. During a press conference on Capitol Hill, Cheney did not mince words as he pointed fingers at the current administration for what he deemed as its role in enabling the rise of ISIS. "President Obama has paved the way for this predicament," Cheney declared with conviction.  As he prepared to attentively listen to President Obama's address on Wednesday night, outlining plans to dismantle the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, Cheney confessed to harboring low expectations. "I am not holding my breath for anything substantial," he admitted candidly. In Cheney's eyes, the president's rhetoric surrounding Iraq has been marked by a disconcerting detachment from reality. "Quite frankly," Cheney asserted, "whenever President Obama discusses Iraq, his words tend to be tinged with delusion."  The former Commander-in-Chief, known for his unwavering stance on national security, expressed his belief that under his leadership, the situation in Iraq would not have deteriorated to its current state. Cheney's remarks, delivered with an air of authority, underscore his perception of President Obama as a catalyst for the present instability in the region.”X]  Former Vice-President Dick Cheney underwent a heart transplant today, while former President George W. Bush remains on a waiting list for a brain, according to hospital officials. The intricate reconstruction procedure on Mr. Cheney's circulatory system was carried out by Halliburton, as part of a government contract signed during his tenure as Vice-President. The cost to taxpayers amounted to a staggering $14.2 billion. The surgeon who performed the operation described it as highly invasive, fulfilling the Vice-President's preferences. Although Mr. Cheney is expected to fully recover, he experienced some disorientation upon awakening from anesthesia. When asked about the current President of the United States, he momentarily questioned if he still held that position. However, he quickly regained alertness, engaging in conversations with his doctors and engaging in his characteristic hunting activities by accidentally shooting someone in the face. Former President Bush made a visit to the hospital, adorning Mr. Cheney's room with a Mission Accomplished banner prior to the completion of the operation.”Xw  Millionaires Unite in Washington to Thwart Minimum Wage Increase  WASHINGTON â€” In an extraordinary display of unity, a diverse coalition of millionaires descended upon the nation's capital today to halt a proposed bill that aimed to raise the hourly minimum wage for American workers to $10.10. Leaving behind their opulent mansions and extravagant yachts, these wealthy individuals were driven by what they perceived as an existential threat to the nation, according to Mitch McConnell, a spokesperson for the coalition.  "This is a truly diverse coalition," McConnell emphasized, highlighting the broad spectrum of wealth represented, ranging from the rich to the very rich to the super-rich. McConnell expressed hope that the coalition's united front in voting down the bill would enhance their reputation as influential individuals who get things accomplished.  Dismissing accusations of inaction, McConnell asserted, "Those who label us as 'do-nothings' couldn't be more mistaken. We spring into action when it comes to preventing workers from receiving higher wages."  The proposed legislation, which had gained traction among lawmakers seeking to address income inequality, faced a formidable opponent in the form of this well-heeled coalition. With their shared interests at stake, the millionaires effectively lobbied against the bill to ensure their financial status quo remained intact.”X}	  In a stunning turn of events, 28-year-old Jennifer Bauer, a resident of Boston, experienced a night that can only be described as extraordinary. After a grueling week, all she yearned for was a peaceful evening devoid of any mishaps. Little did she know, her wish was about to be granted. Against all odds, Bauer's desires were met and surpassed, leaving her in a state of disbelief.  The remarkable sequence of events commenced when Bauer received a text message from her closest confidante, Maggie, proposing an outing to a nearby bar accompanied by a select few of their cherished companions. A nearby establishment in the company of a handful of beloved friends - a combination seemingly too good to be true. Yet, astonishingly, this was precisely the scenario Bauer had envisioned for an ideal night. It may appear implausible, but rest assured, this is not a work of fiction. Reality, it seems, can be stranger than fiction.  As Bauer stepped foot inside the bar, she was greeted by a sight that defied all expectations. Amanda, Megan, Megan's significant other Sam, and of course, Maggie, were already present. Miraculously, Bauer did not have to endure the arduous task of securing a table, as it had already been arranged. Take a moment to gather your thoughts, for this revelation may require some mental readjustment. Contrary to what one might assume, the topic of work did not dominate the conversation. Strangely enough, it did not even warrant a mention. And, astonishingly, Bauer found herself blissfully ignorant of the burdens of her day. She indulged in a few reasonably priced libations, fortuitously achieving the optimal level of inebriation. Admittedly, the uncanny nature of this situation is rather disconcerting.  But hold on, as the story takes an even more bewildering turn. At a certain point in the evening, fate, it seems, intervened. The jukebox began to play Bauer's favorite Kanye West song. The sheer improbability of this occurrence is difficult to comprehend. This woman, desperate for a solitary night of tranquility, found herself immersed in a sequence of events that defied all logic. It is safe to say that we are all left dumbfounded by her fortune.  In conclusion, Jennifer Bauer's experience defies rational explanation. A night that promised respite and contentment became a surreal journey into the realms of the inexplicable. It is safe to say that this remarkable tale has left us”X4  In a surprising turn of events, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida faced criticism from potential rivals for the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination after he claimed that human activity does not cause climate change. Texas Governor Rick Perry, who is also eyeing a presidential run, expressed his disbelief at Rubio's sudden change of stance on the issue. "Now that Marco is thinking of running for President, he doesn't believe in climate change," Perry scoffed. "To those of us with long track records of ignorance on this issue, he seems a little late to the rodeo."  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky joined in the criticism, referring to Rubio as a "dummy-come-lately" when it comes to climate change. Paul emphasized that he believed Republican voters would be able to distinguish between those who are genuinely uninformed and those who are simply pretending. "At the end of the day, I have faith that Republican voters can tell the difference between someone who's truly uninformed and someone who's just faking it," Paul stated. "These comments by Marco don't pass the smell test."  Feeling the pressure, Senator Rubio defended himself against the attacks, asserting that questioning the authenticity of his ignorance was deeply offensive. "My refusal to accept the scientific research on climate change is a matter of public record," he asserted. "On this issue and many others, my ignorance should take a back seat to no one's." Rubio's defensive response suggests that he is committed to maintaining his position on climate change, despite the criticism from his potential rivals.”X  A Life-Altering Experience for a 10-Year-Old Vacationer in Santa Barbara  SANTA BARBARA, CA - In an unexpected turn of events, Taylor Mannello, a seemingly ordinary 10-year-old, has been bestowed with an extraordinary responsibility during his family's vacation. This morning, as the Mannellos checked into the Best Western hotel, Taylor was given his very own room key, an occurrence that promises to alter the course of his young life.   The implications of this newfound freedom are nothing short of staggering. Taylor, a fifth-grader, is now permitted to venture outside the confines of his family's hotel room unaccompanied. As long as he adheres to the rule of informing his parents of his whereabouts and refrains from staying out for excessive periods, the 10-year-old possesses the liberty to explore the hotel premises at will. The elevator, the business center, the weight room, and even the pool are now at his disposal. It is not inconceivable, then, that he might decide on a whim to visit the jacuzzi. Remarkably, Taylor has not yet reached middle school, making this newfound autonomy all the more extraordinary.  However, it would be erroneous to assume that Taylor is taking this responsibility lightly. Ever since receiving the room key - a sleek, plastic card resembling a credit card - from his father, he has diligently safeguarded it in the zipper pocket of his cargo shorts. He is acutely aware that losing this precious item would render him keyless for the remainder of their stay. Taylor's younger sister, Katy, has not been granted such a privilege, as it is believed she lacks the maturity to handle the responsibility.  As of now, there is no evidence to suggest that Taylor has succumbed to the allure of his newfound powers. He has yet to betray his parents' trust by engaging in any reckless behavior, such as clandestinely venturing into the hallway to frolic with the ice machine. Nevertheless, with three more days until checkout, the temptation remains ever-present. We wish Taylor the best of luck as he navigates this uncharted territory.”X¡   New Yorkers Brace for Impending Sludge Onslaught  If you thought your worries were already plentiful, brace yourself for yet another anxiety-inducing development. Today, the U.S. Sludge Warden issued a disconcerting announcement, revealing that the dreaded sludge is making its way towards us, and regrettably, there seems to be little we can do to avert disaster. During a press conference, the Sludge Warden cautioned that this hazardous substance, exhibiting signs of unrest, is poised to arrive imminently. "We have been closely monitoring the situation, and the current conditions are highly conducive to the sludge's return," the Sludge Warden soberly stated. "At this juncture, containment efforts are futile; it is merely a matter of time."  "Do not attempt to flee, for no mortal, regardless of age or gender, can escape the sludge," he continued ominously. "This malevolent force will engulf us all." To compound our concerns, the Sludge Warden cautioned that the sludge's impending arrival remains shrouded in uncertainty. Whether it will approach from the north or south, east or west, sky or sea, remains unpredictable. All we can be certain of is that its onslaught looms ever closer.  Until this menace manifests itself, the Sludge Warden implores all Americans to adopt basic precautions in order to safeguard against its ravages. Suggestions include interring family heirlooms, reintroducing pets to the wild, and encasing children and the elderly in garbage bags. However, he reiterated that regardless of the preparations made, the sludge will inexorably have its way. "We will remain oblivious until the very moment it engulfs us," he gravely warned.  As the nation grapples with the impending onslaught, we implore you, our readers, to share your strategies for confronting this imminent calamity. Reach out to us on Facebook or Twitter and enlighten us on what you and your loved ones are doing to prepare for the sludge's arrival.”X¨  Uh-oh.

The poll respondents expressed support for the isolation of several other cable-news personalities, including the entire cast of Fox & Friends. However, an overwhelming seventy-two percent of participants endorsed the idea of placing Blitzer under quarantine.   Officials at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have confirmed that a potential Blitzer quarantine is being seriously considered, with an effective plan already in place. The CDC spokesperson emphasized that the proposed quarantine would involve a lockdown of The Situation Room, where Blitzer conducts his renowned program. Under this plan, Blitzer would be provided with essential provisions, such as food and water, until the crisis subsides.   The growing sentiment in favor of isolating Blitzer reflects the anxieties gripping the nation as Ebola continues to dominate headlines. While the virus itself remains a serious concern, the widespread fear and panic it has generated are proving to be equally formidable. As a result, public opinion has started to shift towards preventive measures aimed at curbing the dissemination of fear and misinformation.   The support for quarantining Blitzer and other prominent news personalities underscores the public's desire to limit the spread of potentially dangerous information and the resulting panic. By ensuring that influential figures are adequately informed and contained, authorities hope to maintain a sense of calm and rationality among the general population.   As the nation grapples with the complexities of the Ebola crisis, the proposed quarantine of Blitzer signifies a broader shift in public perception. Americans are increasingly recognizing the need to combat the psychological impact of the virus, which can exacerbate the situation and hinder effective decision-making. By focusing on measures to curtail the spread of fear, officials are striving to strike a balance between public safety and the preservation of rationality.”X´  Construction in Sochi is well on track to meet the deadline for the 2018 Winter Olympics, according to Dmitri Brilosky, Russia's head of Olympic planning. Despite facing accusations of being too optimistic, Brilosky expressed confidence in reaching the 2018 deadline. He proudly highlighted the progress made by his team in constructing bathrooms at the site, stating that surveillance cameras had been successfully installed and preparations were underway to install toilets. However, when questioned about the presence of elevators in all the elevator shafts by 2018, the Russian official responded more cautiously, acknowledging the need to verify the status of this aspect of the project.”XI  Jenna Jameson, renowned adult film star, held a press conference today to address her recent endorsement of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney for President. Concerned about potential mockery and insinuations, Ms. Jameson aimed to provide a clear explanation for her headline-grabbing decision. When questioned about what initially attracted her to Mr. Romney, she humorously stated, "He's the only person who's assumed more positions than I have." The actress claimed to have thoroughly researched Mr. Romney's career and expressed admiration for his tenure at Bain Capital, emphasizing the financial aspect, stating, "There's nothing more American, I think, than profiting from unknown individuals." While Mr. Romney's recent foreign trip garnered criticism, Ms. Jameson praised his unfiltered communication style, stating, "I respect someone who speaks without considering the consequences." Addressing the controversy surrounding Mr. Romney's offshore bank accounts, the actress, known for her character Holly So Tightly in the film Dirt Merchant, appeared unfazed, stating, "I've invested my assets in numerous foreign locations." Concluding her press conference, Ms. Jameson reiterated her unwavering support for the Republican candidate, asserting, "Mitt Romney will replicate nationwide what I have already achieved with half of America."”X–  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia criticized cable network A&E today, arguing that their suspension of Phil Robertson, the star of the TV series Duck Dynasty, was unconstitutional. In a joint press conference with fellow Justice Clarence Thomas, Scalia expressed his anger towards A&E's decision and insisted that it should be reversed immediately. Scalia asserted that Robertson was simply exercising his First Amendment right to express an opinion, which he believed many other Americans also shared. He cautioned that such a suspension could have a detrimental impact on freedom of speech in the country, raising concerns about potential censorship of even Supreme Court Justices. Scalia, a devoted fan of Duck Dynasty, stressed that his objection to Mr. Robertson's suspension was solely based on constitutional principles. He adamantly stated that A&E's decision would not be upheld, and he intended to call an emergency session of the Supreme Court to overturn it. Scalia argued that A&E's action was a clear violation of the Constitution and indicated that he was not alone in his belief within the Court. However, Justice Thomas declined to comment on the matter.”X^  Supreme Court Rules Annual Physicals Unconstitutional, Advocates Random Strip Searches by Police  In an unexpected and far-reaching decision that has sent shockwaves through the healthcare and law enforcement communities, the Supreme Court declared today that annual physicals are unconstitutional and should be replaced with random strip searches conducted by police officers. This ruling, which seemingly expands the role of the police to include tasks like conducting breast and prostate exams, has sparked widespread surprise and concern.  Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, argued that while the Constitution does not explicitly address healthcare, it does safeguard the people's right to form militias. Scalia posited that the Founding Fathers intended for individuals with firearms, rather than medical professionals, to be responsible for invasive searches. "Clearly, the Founders believed that if anyone should be looking up our asses, it shouldn't be a doctor, but someone with a gun," Scalia wrote.  The Court's decision to replace annual checkups with random strip searches has raised alarm within the healthcare community, as experts worry that patients will not receive the necessary care. However, Justice Samuel Alito dismissed these concerns, asserting that citizens hold the ultimate responsibility for securing adequate medical attention. "When a policeman is searching his body cavities, for example, it's up to the citizen to say, 'There's a mole I'd like you to look at,'" Alito stated.  Justice Clarence Thomas expressed his personal readiness for a random strip search and exam at any given moment, even revealing, "I've got nothing on under this robe." Thomas' statement highlights the division within the Court and the contrasting views among the justices regarding this groundbreaking ruling.  The decision has left many pondering the potential implications for individual privacy, doctor-patient relationships, and the overall state of healthcare in America. It remains to be seen how this ruling will be implemented and whether it will face legal challenges or significant backlash from the public.”XÊ  In a recent poll, a majority of Republican voters have indicated their support for former Massachusetts Governor, Mitt Romney, marking a significant moment for his campaign. When asked about their reasons for backing Romney, a majority of those polled strongly expressed that there were no other viable options left in the race. This sentiment further solidifies Romney's position as the presumptive nominee. In light of his victories in five primary states on Tuesday night, Romney addressed his supporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, expressing his admiration for American democracy. His success in the primaries led former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to suspend his campaign, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum also offered his support for Romney, acknowledging that he had no alternative choice. These developments emphasize that financial resources can play a significant role in securing the nomination.”XJ  Donald Trump, the current leading candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, sparked intense controversy on Wednesday with his proposal to construct a wall inside the uterus if elected. By suggesting this addition to a crucial female reproductive organ, Trump aimed to emphasize its distinction from the existing uterine wall. The real estate mogul claimed that his proposed wall would be far superior to the current one, which he dismissed as inadequate. Trump confidently stated that the public would embrace this new wall. However, in line with his campaign style, the candidate provided scant details regarding his plan for constructing a wall inside the uterus, other than mentioning that women would be responsible for its funding.

Carson, known for his outspoken views, expressed concerns that a marauding swarm of dragons armed with flames capable of reaching towering heights could potentially annihilate life on our planet. Astonishingly, he claimed that not a single Democratic contender had even contemplated such a perilous scenario.  While the Las Vegas debate witnessed Democrats engaging in heated discussions on topics such as guns, Syria, and income inequality, Carson, a Republican Presidential hopeful, criticized their apparent neglect of the crucial issue at hand. "I did not hear the word 'dragon' once," Carson lamented during an interview with Fox News. In a bold pledge, he promised to assemble the brightest minds in technology to develop a dome constructed from dragon-proof material, should he secure the Presidency. As a contingency plan, Carson proposed persuading the dragons to direct their wrath towards Mars, rather than Earth, in the event of an attack.  According to Carson, his unparalleled preparedness to shield the United States from dragon-related threats sets him apart from his competitors. "This is the problem that keeps me up at night," he confessed. Concerned about the potential devastation that could result from a dragon onslaught, Carson's unwavering commitment to safeguarding the nation from these mythical creatures seems to be driving his campaign forward.”XÌ  Donald Trump's failure to insult fellow Republican candidate John Kasich within 24 hours of the Ohio governor entering the 2016 Presidential race has had a detrimental effect on Trump's poll numbers. Many supporters expressed a sudden loss of confidence in the real-estate mogul. Trump's gaffe occurred during a campaign rally in Des Moines on Wednesday when the former reality-show star admitted that he did not yet know enough about Kasich to properly insult him.  "I could get up here and call Kasich a loser, because my gut tells me that's what he is, but you've come to expect something more special out of me," Trump said. "If you bear with me, I promise you that I'll come up with a world-class insult that we can all be proud of."  The audience reacted with stunned silence, leading some observers to question whether Trump's failure to insult Kasich would turn into a full-blown scandal. Carol Foyler, a Trump supporter who attended the Des Moines event, said that she still liked Trump because of the insults he had delivered in the past, but she acknowledged that her belief in him had been shaken.  "When you're in the White House and that phone rings, you've got to be ready to insult someone right away," she said.”X  Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Presidential candidate, is expected to fully embrace Bernie Sanders's positions on major issues by noon on Thursday, according to officials from the Clinton campaign. Shortly after Sanders entered the Democratic race, Clinton swiftly released comprehensive position papers on trade, income inequality, national defense, and the environment, aligning closely with the Vermont senator's views. Sanders, who had planned to position himself to the left of Clinton in the 2016 election, woke up at 8 A.M. only to find that while he slept, Clinton had already begun moving slightly to the left of him. In a video released Thursday morning, Clinton warmly welcomed Sanders to the race, stating, "To those who share Bernie Sanders's views, let me assure you, I am Bernie Sanders." Sanders, who had scheduled a speech in Vermont for 11 A.M., abruptly cancelled it, acknowledging that Clinton had already expressed everything he had intended to say an hour earlier. Visibly shaken, the Vermont politician confessed to reporters that he was unsure whether he would continue with his campaign, stating, "I don't know anymore. I just don't know."”X“  Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin has continued to stand by his controversial comments regarding the female body, suggesting that the uterus should play a prominent role in national security. In an interview with KTVI-TV, Rep. Akin stated that there is seemingly nothing that the uterus does not know. He compared its knowledge to Spider-Man's spidey sense, but instead of a tingle, it occurs in the "lady parts." Rep. Akin argued that due to the uterus's extraordinary powers of detection, it should be utilized as America's secret weapon in the war on terror. He even proposed the idea of placing uteri at airports and along the border to enhance security measures, confident that no evildoer would be able to bypass these defenses. Rep. Akin concluded the interview by expressing his admiration and respect for the female reproductive system, admitting that he wishes he possessed the intelligence of a uterus.”X¥  In a surprising turn of events, Standard and Poor's, the renowned financial services company, has taken an unprecedented step by downgrading Iowa's intelligence quotient (I.Q.) in response to the results of today's Iowa straw poll. While the full implications of this extraordinary measure remain uncertain, experts suggest that the I.Q. downgrade could lead to challenges for Iowans in articulating thoughts coherently or navigating modern technology, such as operating a television remote.  An S. & P. spokesperson acknowledged that this downgrade would likely distress Republicans in Iowa, adding a touch of irony by noting that they were unlikely to comprehend the ramifications fully. On a brighter note, Representative Michele Bachmann (R., Minn.) emerged as the victor in the straw poll and delivered an impassioned victory speech that was broadcast statewide in English. Nonetheless, Representative Bachmann may face an uphill battle ahead, as a recent poll reveals a decline in her support among voters who identify as less intellectually inclined, with Texas Governor Rick Perry emerging as a beneficiary.  Governor Perry, seizing the moment, launched his presidential campaign today in South Carolina, introducing a fresh stump speech that pledged to overturn the advancements of the twentieth century. This bold move by Perry is sure to create ripples in the political landscape as the race for the Republican nomination intensifies.”X.  In an effort to address ongoing concerns about his finances, Mitt Romney, the Republican Presidential nominee, made a surprising statement today, revealing that his tax returns had been consumed by his dog and that said dog had also served as the Chief Executive Officer of Bain Capital from 1999 to 2002. This disclosure, which Romney shared during a campaign event in New Hampshire, evoked strong emotions and harkened back to Richard M. Nixon's famous "Checkers speech" in 1952, where he invoked his pet dog. Romney spoke passionately about his Irish setter, Seamus Romney, stating, "Seamus was more than a dog." His voice quivered as he continued, "As CEO of Bain, he was a job creator." However, this revelation about Seamus' involvement in private equity has prompted further scrutiny, with a spokesperson from People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) questioning the credibility of Romney's account. Carol Foyler of PETA remarked, "If we are to believe Mitt Romney, in 2002 while Seamus was supposedly running Bain Capital, he would have been at least 140 years old [in dog years]. This far-fetched tale is just another act of animal cruelty by Mitt Romney." In response to PETA's critique, Romney promptly issued an amended statement, clarifying that Seamus had in fact served as the CEO of Bain posthumously. Meanwhile, Ann Romney, Mitt's wife, had a relatively uneventful day following her recent gaffe on ABC's Good Morning America, where she made a controversial comment about "you people." She was seen calmly riding home on the roof of the Romney family car.”X8  In a nation fraught with divisive debates, the topic of children wielding military firearms emerged as the latest contentious issue on Wednesday. As pollster Davis Logsdon aptly points out, this matter is so multifaceted and intricate that it defies simple solutions. Comparing it to the ongoing national discourse on the wisdom of loading a car with dynamite and crashing it into a tree, Logsdon notes that opinions on allowing young children to handle automatic weapons are similarly divided. While a significant portion of Americans view this idea with dismay, others argue that with proper supervision, it is perfectly acceptable. Determining who is right in this complex predicament proves to be a formidable task. Logsdon further draws parallels to the national debate surrounding the use of flamethrowers indoors, emphasizing the arduous and contentious nature of these discussions. Just like the enduring debates on jumping off roofs, licking electrical sockets, and gargling with thumbtacks, the vexing question of whether children should be permitted to handle military-grade firearms appears destined for a protracted and unresolved deliberation. Much like the question of whether one should approach a bear from behind and prod it with a searing poker, it seems unlikely that a swift resolution will be reached anytime soon.”•‘     X	  North Korean Leader Expresses Disappointment Over Republicans' Letter to Iran  In a surprising turn of events, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un expressed his feelings of being snubbed by the decision of forty-seven Republican senators to write a letter to Iran but not to him, according to the official North Korean news agency. The unusually forthcoming interview with the Korean Central News Agency (K.C.N.A.) shed light on Kim's hurtful perception that the Republicans were playing favorites with enemies.  "I try not to take things personally, but it's hard to see them sending letters to Iran without feeling a little bit hurt," Kim lamented. Over the past two days, Kim revealed that he had his aides checking his mailbox on an hourly basis in hopes of finding a letter from the Republicans. However, his hopes have dwindled, and he admitted, "I thought I'd at least rate a text or something."  Kim's disappointment raises questions about the dynamics of international relations and the perception of power. "What does Iran have that I don't have?" he pondered, highlighting his confusion over the Republicans' actions. As North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, Kim expressed his concern that he may be taken for granted.  The North Korean leader's candidness offers a rare glimpse into his personal feelings and the complexities of diplomatic interactions. While the Republicans' letter to Iran has garnered significant attention and controversy, Kim's public expression of hurt reveals the potential ramifications of neglecting diplomatic communication with a longstanding adversary.  As tensions continue to rise on the Korean Peninsula, Kim's disappointment serves as a reminder of the delicate balance required in international relations. While some may dismiss his emotional response, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of neglecting communication with nations, particularly those with nuclear capabilities.  The absence of a letter from the Republicans to Kim Jong-un may seem insignificant in the grand scheme of global affairs, but it raises important questions about the role of communication and respect in international politics. As the North Korean leader reflects on his perceived snub, the world watches with anticipation to see how these developments will shape future diplomatic relations.”Xk  Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida, has taken a significant step towards his bid for the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination by officially resigning from his position as the brother of George W. Bush. This move, regarded as a crucial step in clearing the path to the nomination, was confirmed by an aide on New Year's Day. The aide expressed confidence that this decision would lead to a surge in Jeb's poll numbers.   According to the aide, the former Florida governor resigned from his post as brother during a brief ten-minute phone call with George W. Bush, following which he promptly blocked his brother's phone number and email address. In an official statement, George W. Bush expressed understanding and support for his former brother's decision. He further empathized with Jeb's choice, stating, "If I were him, I would no longer be related to me either."”X·  The New Yorker Acquires the selfnews, Bringing Lies to a New Home  In a surprising turn of events, The New Yorker has acquired the selfnews, a publication known for its fabrication of news stories. While some may wonder how the move to The New Yorker, renowned for its rigorous fact-checking, will impact the selfnews, it appears that its commitment to falsehoods will remain unchanged. The column will now reside at newyorker.com, marking a new chapter for the selfnews.  Devoted readers of the selfnews may question whether this relocation will compromise its editorial independence. However, David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, has reassured the selfnews writer that he can continue to pen whatever he pleases, with the exception of mocking Malcolm Gladwell. Therefore, it seems that the selfnews will retain its distinctive voice even under the umbrella of The New Yorker.  Amidst the announcement, the selfnews writer takes a moment to share a genuine sentiment. The passing of his mother, Helen Borowitz, at the age of eighty-three has deeply affected him. Recalling how she adored The New Yorker throughout her life and introduced him to the publication during his formative years, he expresses gratitude that the selfnews will now find a place within The New Yorker. This development would have brought immense joy to his late mother. As a tribute to her memory, he dedicates all future columns to her.  With this acquisition, The New Yorker embraces the selfnews, recognizing its unique charm and accepting its commitment to inaccuracy. As the selfnews settles into its new home, readers can expect the same blend of fabricated stories, with the occasional apology for mistakenly stumbling upon truth.”Xò  In the aftermath of the United States Senate's decision to roll back significant sections of the Patriot Act, former President George W. Bush expressed remorse that the law had been partially repealed without him ever having the opportunity to familiarize himself with its contents. Reflecting on the time when the legislation was being debated and adopted, Bush revealed that those in the White House had spoken highly of the law. "I distinctly recall thinking to myself, I really must read that," Bush shared from his residence in Crawford, Texas.  Following the enactment of the Patriot Act, Bush admitted to jotting down a reminder on a small Post-It note, urging himself to read the legislation. "It was certainly a priority for me," he affirmed. However, as time elapsed, Bush conceded that he failed to allocate time for this task. While acknowledging that it may now be too late to delve into the intricacies of the law due to its partial reversal, Bush hinted that he might still peruse it merely to understand the commotion surrounding it. "I believe they have a copy at my Presidential library, so perhaps I will dedicate some time in the future to examine it," he mused, before humorously adding, "But who am I kidding? That's highly unlikely to happen."”XÎ  In a rather unprecedented display of sentimentality from the expected Republican nominee, Mitt Romney made an unexpected trip to his offshore assets in the Cayman Islands. Standing amidst a trove of wealth inside a bank vault, Mr. Romney commended his funds for their valiant efforts in the ongoing battle for liberation from federal income taxes. He further proclaimed that his prosperity had evoked envy from individuals worldwide, remarking, "Thanks to your diligent endeavors, I am the envy of the less fortunate. To that, I extend my utmost admiration." While emphasizing that his funds' mission in the Caymans remained unfinished, he declined to provide a specific timeline for withdrawal. Alluding to his presidential aspirations, Mr. Romney expressed, "It would be an esteemed privilege to grace your surface with my countenance someday." After immersing himself in the pile of currency to individually touch numerous dollar bills, Mr. Romney departed in his private jet for an unanticipated visit to Switzerland. In other political developments, Newt Gingrich suspended his presidential campaign today, explaining to journalists, "A campaign is akin to a spouse. When it teeters on life support, it is time to bid adieu."”Xh  In an attempt to underscore his fundamental principles leading up to Tuesday night's primary contests, former Senator Rick Santorum embarked on a campaign swing through the seventeenth century today. During the first stop on this ambitious journey, Mr. Santorum reiterated his reasons for seeking the White House, stating, "I am running for President today because the position of Spanish Inquisitor is no longer available." The former Pennsylvania senator endeavored to appease his seventeenth-century supporters, asserting that, "Since we all concur that contraception is an unfavorable concept, it is now time to scrutinize electricity and soap more closely." Mr. Santorum, who pledged to revoke the Age of Enlightenment on his first day in office, placed great emphasis on the fact that he had personally educated all seven of his children. He proclaimed, "This indicates that there are at least eight individuals in this country who remain oblivious to the concept of evolution." In a lighthearted moment, Senator Santorum shared what he claimed to be his favorite joke with the audience: "A Kenyan, a Muslim, and a socialist walk into a bar. And then he makes everyone get an abortion." Meanwhile, elsewhere on the campaign trail, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich garnered attention with his remarks on education, asserting, "We should not leave any child behind, only wives."”X  In a moment of reflection at the Supreme Court today, Justice Antonin Scalia humbly acknowledged the privilege he felt in serving on the highest court of the land. He candidly remarked to his fellow Justices, "I can say stuff here that got me fired at Kinkos." This seemingly innocuous comment prompted curious glances from his colleagues, prompting Scalia to recount a lesser-known episode from his past in the mid-1970s when he briefly worked at a copying establishment. He fondly recalled, "They were pretty uptight. It seemed like every time I opened my mouth, I got hauled into H.R."  Justice Scalia went on to explain that during his time at Kinkos, he received a stern reprimand from a woman in Human Resources who cautioned him, "Nino, you can't just go around insulting blacks and women and whatnot. There's not a workplace in the country that will tolerate that." With a chuckle, Scalia admitted, "Well, guess what? She was right... until I got this job." While expressing gratitude for the latitude he now enjoys to offend gays, minorities, and women in his current position, Mr. Scalia acknowledged that it had effectively spoiled him for life in the "real world."  "I'll be at some ballgame shooting my mouth off, and suddenly I'm face down in the ground with someone's foot up my ass," Scalia lamented. "And then I'll have to remind myself, Nino, if you've got something to say, save it for the Supreme Court." These insightful remarks underscored the unique nature of his position and the unparalleled freedom of expression it affords him.”XI  In a historic turn of events, the American people have spoken, propelling Barack and Michelle Obama back to the White House for another term while relegating Mitt and Ann Romney to the era of 1954. This election marks a significant milestone in the political career of Mr. Romney, who had ardently pursued the presidency for an astonishing sixty-five years.  Speaking to his loyal supporters at the Boston Convention Center, Mr. Romney expressed mixed emotions about his defeat. While acknowledging the bitter taste of losing the election, he found solace in the fact that he would no longer be required to disclose his tax returns to the public scrutiny. Had he emerged victorious, Mr. Romney would have made history as the first president to ascend to the highest office in the land after openly disregarding the concerns of half the nation.  In a characteristic display of resilience, the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, Paul Ryan, addressed his defeat with a touch of bravado. Speaking to his dedicated followers, he confidently claimed victory, despite the outcome suggesting otherwise.”Xj  Brain Surgeons Relieved by Ben Carson's Shattering of Stereotype  In a surprising turn of events, brain surgeons across the nation are expressing their gratitude towards Republican Presidential candidate Ben Carson for dispelling the long-standing notion that they are among the smartest individuals in the world. Interviews conducted with these doctors reveal the immense pressure they have faced to live up to the exaggerated reputation of intelligence associated with their profession, a burden that Carson has singlehandedly alleviated.  Harland Dorrinson, a renowned neurosurgeon in Toledo, Ohio, shared his experience of being perceived as a genius simply because of his profession. "When people found out I was a brain surgeon, they would always assume I was some kind of a genius," he stated. "Now they are beginning to understand that you can know a lot about brain surgery and virtually nothing about anything else." Dorrinson explained that acquaintances used to seek his wisdom on various subjects, but ever since Carson made his infamous claim that prisons can turn people gay, that expectation has significantly diminished.  Interestingly, Dorrinson revealed his intention to contribute to Carson's campaign in order to ensure he remains in the race. "Every time he says something, it helps bring people's unrealistic expectations about brain surgeons back down to earth," he admitted. Furthermore, Dorrinson expressed his satisfaction with Carson's recent declaration that Muslims should not be eligible for the presidency. "Now you can cross politics off the list of things that people will expect me to be knowledgeable about," he exclaimed. "I think I speak for a lot of brain surgeons when I say, 'Thank you, Ben Carson.'"  In conclusion, the unexpected impact of Carson's controversial remarks has provided relief for brain surgeons who have long grappled with the unattainable reputation of being the world's smartest individuals. Carson's ability to challenge this perception has allowed these doctors to escape the burden of being seen as all-knowing authorities, and instead focus on their expertise in the field of brain surgery.”X
	  CIA Secretly Infiltrates Al Qaeda with JPMorgan Chase Executives  In a covert operation aimed at dismantling the remnants of Al Qaeda, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been deploying executives from JPMorgan Chase, the banking giant, within the terror network. The agency had intended to keep this mission under wraps, but it recently came to light when Al Qaeda ousted two of its top officials for engaging in highly speculative betting on credit-default swaps with the organization's funds. This unusual behavior caught the attention of analysts across the intelligence community, who questioned whether it was characteristic of Al Qaeda.  One analyst, who requested anonymity, remarked, "When I heard about this, my immediate thought was that it sounded more like the work of JPMorgan. Even for Al Qaeda, these investments were incredibly risky. They have a reputation for being extremists, but this seemed out of character." The dismissals of the top officials raised suspicions about the involvement of JPMorgan in the terror network's financial activities.  CIA Director David Petraeus, when questioned about the covert mission, confirmed its success during a recent press briefing. He stated, "If your objective is to cripple an organization, there is no one better suited for the job than these JPMorgan experts. One individual from their ranks can inflict more damage than a thousand drone strikes." Petraeus's remarks suggested that the deployment of JPMorgan executives had yielded fruitful results in targeting Al Qaeda's financial resources.  However, General Petraeus may have prematurely celebrated the success of the operation. Today, the official Al Qaeda website claimed that the terror organization was on the verge of securing a significant financial bailout package from a consortium of state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran and North Korea. The website boldly asserted, "Al Qaeda is too big to fail."  The revelation of the CIA's infiltration mission and the subsequent claims of a financial bailout package have created an air of uncertainty surrounding the future of Al Qaeda's financial operations. As analysts scrutinize the developments, the efficacy of the CIA's strategy and the potential consequences of Al Qaeda's alleged bailout remain subjects of intense speculation.”Xb  In a momentous event that unfolded within the hallowed walls of the Oval Office on Thursday morning, President Barack Obama affixed his signature to an executive order that would instantaneously dissolve Congress. The President, in a bid to enhance the operational efficacy of the federal government, emphasized the remarkable progress he had achieved since severing ties with Congress in November. Moreover, the elimination of this legislative body would lead to annual savings surpassing five billion dollars, which President Obama pledged to reimburse to the American taxpayers. While recognizing that some purists might contend that the Constitution mandates three branches of government, the President argued that his decree simply reduced that number by one.  The initial response from the public to the President's bold decision appeared overwhelmingly favorable, as news of the executive order propelled his approval rating to a staggering seventy-nine percent. Fielding queries from the press regarding any message he might have for members of Congress, President Obama confidently asserted, "I got it from here."”X²  Former Vice-President Dick Cheney issued a fervent plea on Tuesday, urging nations across the globe to take decisive action in prohibiting the abominable and repugnant practice of disseminating torture reports. In a prepared statement, Cheney expressed his profound shock and revulsion at the Senate Intelligence Committee's recent publication of a torture report, asserting that its transparency and candor flagrantly transgress the principles upon which our nation stands. He adamantly declared that the release of such reports is an offense not only to those implicated in past acts of torture, but also to all individuals who may entertain the notion of engaging in such practices in the future. Citing the Senate's distressing disclosure as his impetus for action, Cheney vowed an unwavering commitment to eradicate the pernicious scourge of torture reports from the annals of history, as long as he possesses breath in his body. Concluding his statement, Cheney called for an international summit dedicated to addressing the issue of torture reports, beseeching all prominent nations to unite in denouncing and exposing this abhorrent practice, and to resolutely affirm, "This is not who we are."”Xx  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, announced plans on Tuesday to introduce a bill aimed at imposing more transparent identification measures for individuals associated with white supremacist organizations. The proposed legislation, titled the White Supremacist Labelling Act of 2015, seeks to mandate that white supremacists wear conspicuous name tags measuring 4 inches by 6 inches, clearly identifying them as members of recognized hate groups.  Scalise argues that the current lack of discernibility between neo-Nazis and collectors of World War II memorabilia necessitates the implementation of clearer labeling requirements. By enforcing distinct identification for white supremacists, lawmakers would be better equipped to comprehend the nature of the organizations they are confronting in future policy-making endeavors.  Acknowledging the challenges posed by the prevalence of burning crosses and the resultant smoke, the Louisiana congressman suggested that the proposed labeling system would help cut through the haze and enable lawmakers to navigate the complex issue of white supremacy more effectively.”X¬  In a heartfelt address to his loyal supporters, former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, expressed an overwhelming sense of relief on Friday as he announced the preservation of his extensive portfolio of five to ten residences scattered across the nation. Romney, known for his ardent advocacy for the concerns of everyday Americans, candidly admitted that he had been prepared to engage in discussions about his genuine empathy for the common man. Yet, the prospect of relinquishing his cherished assortment of abodes had left him emotionally drained, even describing it as a potentially brutal experience.  The 2012 Republican nominee conveyed his profound gratitude for retaining the luxurious car elevator, an opulent fixture nestled within the sprawling eleven-thousand-square-foot mansion he proudly calls home in the picturesque region of La Jolla. Demonstrating his unyielding enthusiasm, Romney exclaimed, "Come on, that thing is neat!" Clearly, the preservation of this unique amenity brought him immeasurable joy.  As Romney navigates the intricate web of political discourse, it becomes evident that the preservation of his lavish properties holds immense personal significance.”X  A vast majority of registered voters who abstained from voting last Tuesday believe that the United States is heading in the wrong direction, with no one taking action to rectify the situation, according to a recent survey. This sentiment, fueled by anger, frustration, and a prevailing sense of doom, dominated the mood of those who chose to abstain from participating in Election Day. Exit polls targeting these non-participants were conducted as they exited malls, nail salons, gyms, and other locations where voting did not occur on Tuesday.  Carol Foyler, a thirty-one-year-old from Akron, Ohio, expressed her disillusionment with the current state of affairs: "The system is broken. We need to find a way for ordinary citizens to make their voices heard and have some influence on the decision-makers in Washington." The economy, jobs, and terrorism were the primary concerns weighing on the minds of those who chose not to cast their ballots. Mark Gardziak, a forty-seven-year-old who spent Election Day shopping for a phone, confessed his sleepless nights worrying about the future of the country for his children and future generations.  While pessimism about the future prevailed among the sixty-three percent of American voters who abstained from exercising their democratic rights on Tuesday, some individuals expressed a glimmer of hope. Tess Shardin, a thirty-eight-year-old who doubted her likelihood of voting in 2016, offered a potential solution: "The only way things could improve is if we all unite and remove the corrupt politicians from power."”X¾  In a recent appearance on the Fox News Channel, former Vice-President Dick Cheney expressed his disappointment that President Obama had the opportunity to bomb Syria, a feat that Cheney himself had long desired. During an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity, Cheney admitted to feeling envious, stating, "That was on my bucket list." When asked if he had any advice for the President regarding the bombing of Syria, Cheney responded with a touch of sarcasm, saying, "Just enjoy it. It doesn't get any better than this."  Towards the end of the interview, the former Vice-President took a moment to reflect on his own tenure. "Look, I had a good run," Cheney explained. "I got to bomb Afghanistan, and I got to do it to Iraqâ€”twice. But to witness someone else finally having the chance to bomb Syria, and it's not me? I would be lying if I said that didn't hurt like hell."  Cheney's remarks highlight the unique perspective of a former Vice-President who played a significant role in shaping American foreign policy during the George W. Bush administration. His longing to fulfill his "bucket list" item of bombing Syria underscores the complexities and personal ambitions that often come with holding high office.”X   Human Beings More Genetically Linked to Neanderthals Than Initially Believed, Scientists Confirm  In a groundbreaking revelation, scientists have confirmed that human beings share a closer genetic relationship with Neanderthals than previously thought. Professor Davis Logsdon, the esteemed chairman of the genetic science department at the esteemed University of Minnesota, has shed new light on the level of Neanderthal genes within humans, noting that it may vary from one individual to another.   "There are certain individuals amidst our society who might outwardly appear human, but are indeed Neanderthals in disguise, so to speak," Professor Logsdon revealed. His cautionary statement serves as a reminder of the intricate genetic tapestry that connects human beings to our ancient ancestors.  However, Professor Logsdon urged against hastily attributing any brutish or savage behavior to the presence of Neanderthal genes. Such assumptions, he argued, would be unjust towards the Neanderthals themselves. "To ascribe negative traits solely based on the amount of Neanderthal genes one possesses is truly unfair," he added, seeking to dispel any misconceptions surrounding our shared genetic history.  This groundbreaking research not only enhances our understanding of human evolution but also raises intriguing questions about the complexities of our genetic makeup. As scientists continue to unravel the mysteries of our ancient past, the intricate connections between Neanderthals and modern humans are becoming ever more apparent.”Xž  In a fiery rebuke, Senator John McCain of Arizona, a prominent Republican figure, fiercely criticized President Obama for his perceived failure to authorize a military strike on the historical site of Stonehenge during his visit to the United Kingdom for the NATO summit. Expressing the urgency of demonstrating American strength to adversaries, McCain conveyed his disappointment in an interview with Fox News. "Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we convey a resolute message to our enemies that the United States stands strong," McCain asserted. He contended that obliterating Stonehenge would serve as a potent symbol of American power. Astonished by what he perceived as Obama's unwillingness to take decisive action, McCain expressed his bewilderment at the President's hesitancy to order airstrikes on the ancient monument. "He had a clear opportunity to strike Stonehenge, and yet he faltered," McCain lamented.”X@   Chinese Hackers Drop US Government as High-Value Target  Chinese hackers made an unexpected announcement today, revealing their decision to remove the United States government from their official list of high-value targets. This revelation comes as a surprise from a notoriously secretive group that shies away from the public eye. A spokesperson for the hackers stated that they needed to allocate their time and energy towards hacking more powerful organizations.  The spokesperson further commented that referring to the United States government as an organization would be a stretch at this point, as it seems to be in a state of abject paralysis on its own. The hackers' ultimate goal had been to incapacitate the U.S. government, and it appears they have already achieved that. Despite years of compromising U.S. government computers, the hackers admitted that they had obtained little of value, particularly from the hard drives of congressional offices. According to the spokesperson, these computers did not seem to be used for work-related purposes. Instead, the hackers discovered nothing more than restaurant reservations and explicit content.  Upon hearing the news of the hackers' decision, U.S. stock markets experienced a significant decline. American politicians swiftly denounced this move as a hostile act intended to cripple the economy. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) expressed his outrage, labeling it an insult to the American people. He demanded that the Chinese hackers resume their activities immediately.  However, the hackers' spokesperson indicated that the chances of the U.S. government being reinstated on their target list were unlikely. They emphasized the need to focus on governments that function at a higher level. Currently, they are closely examining the situation in Venezuela as a potential target.”Xá  Eight Must-Watch Netflix Documentaries You Can't Afford to Miss  In search of a relaxing yet enlightening experience?

Don't miss out on these extraordinary Netflix documentaries that promise to entertain,”X¹  Bernie Sanders' potential run for the 2016 Presidency was declared over on Monday, even before it had a chance to begin. This premature conclusion can be attributed to a crucial aspect of the American political system, which deems a person of integrity ineligible for the White House. According to experts, the electoral system has implemented a series of safeguards in recent decades to prevent individuals with independence and strength of character from occupying the Presidency.  Bernie Sanders' failure to align himself with either major political party automatically excludes him from the intricate web of cronyism and backroom deals that are essential in our current system to secure the Presidency. Davis Logsdon, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, stated, "Sanders' inability to become a member of a major political party disqualifies him. Furthermore, his lack of allegiance to a major corporate interest or investment bank also renders him ineligible."   Logsdon further explains that due to these disqualifications, Sanders would be unable to raise the staggering amount of one billion dollars required under the current system to fund a Presidential campaign. "The primary source of such funds is billionaires, and unfortunately, Sanders has alienated them. It is clear that he did not fully consider the implications of his decision," Logsdon added.  Despite his ineligibility, Sanders may persist in his pursuit of the White House, but Logsdon believes such an effort would ultimately be futile. "Our political system has undergone refinements over the years specifically designed to prevent individuals like Bernie Sanders from reaching the White House. The system works," he concluded.”Xa  Unprecedented Move as Both Major Parties Cancel 2012 Election  In an unexpected turn of events, both major American political parties made a historic decision today to cancel the upcoming 2012 election. This decision, deemed unprecedented by historians, follows a recent poll revealing President Barack Obama's approval rating at an astonishing one hundred percent, a record high for any American President.  Even more remarkable is the fact that President Obama's popularity extends beyond party lines. A majority of Republican voters, displaying an unexpected shift in attitude, expressed their agreement with the statement, "I no longer care that he wasn't born here." This newfound bipartisan spirit sweeping the nation was exemplified by House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio), who, with tears in his eyes, shared with reporters, "This is a great day for America. Oh, leave me alone, goddamn it."  While no official announcement has been made, sources suggest that Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump is contemplating a run for Prime Minister of Canada. This development adds a further twist to the already dramatic turn of events.  The cancellation of the election follows the recent demise of Osama bin Laden, whose final words reportedly were, "I knew I shouldn't have signed up for Foursquare." Notably, Fox News refrained from reporting on bin Laden's death and instead opted to air cartoons indefinitely.  International reactions to bin Laden's demise varied. Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Qaddafi offered a succinct official statement: "Uh-oh." Meanwhile, North Korean President Kim Jong-il mourned the loss of his last friend on Facebook.  In Wasilla, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin urged for action, stating, "We must find and kill Osama bin Laden." Her impassioned plea reflects the gravity of the situation and the shared sentiment of many Americans.  The cancellation of the 2012 election marks a historic moment in American politics, demonstrating a shift in public opinion and a desire for unity. As the nation grapples with these unforeseen developments, only time will tell what lies ahead for the United States.”X=  Carly Fiorina, the former Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett-Packard, has made a splash in the race for the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination. Just a day after she announced her candidacy, a recent poll conducted by the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Opinion Research Institute revealed that Fiorina enjoys exceptionally high name recognition among the thousands of employees she fired during her tenure at Hewlett-Packard. The poll shows that her name recognition stands at a remarkable hundred percent among the terminated employees, who consider her to be unforgettable.  Furthermore, a significant majority of the laid-off workers expressed intense feelings towards Fiorina and stated that they frequently invoke her name in a vehement manner. The survey, supervised by Davis Logsdon from the University of Minnesota, has demonstrated that Fiorina's entry into the Republican race has reinvigorated many former Hewlett-Packard employees. Logsdon noted that most of these employees were previously apathetic about the race, but now they are eagerly following Fiorina's campaign.  What is particularly striking is that Fiorina's hundred-percent name recognition among the fired Hewlett-Packard employees surpasses other notable figures mentioned in the survey, such as Darth Vader (ninety-nine percent) and Satan (ninety-seven percent).”X    Nation Furious with Obamacare Website Issues  The long-awaited arrival of health insurance in the United States has been met with frustration as millions of Americans across the country report wasting precious time on the glitch-ridden website, HealthCare.gov. The site, the official portal for Obamacare, has been plagued with crashes, slow-loading pages, and various technical glitches, causing widespread anger among those attempting to access it simultaneously.  Tracy Klugian, a muffler salesman from Akron, Ohio, expressed his exasperation, saying, "Look, I understand that our country had to wait longer for health care compared to other industrialized nations. But the 35 minutes I spent on that website are 35 minutes I'll never get back." Klugian went on to share his "Obamacare horror story," explaining that the website's slow performance disrupted their Wi-Fi connection to the point where his children couldn't stream videos. "For a program that claims to promote health care, it's causing a lot of stress, which is anything but healthy, in my opinion," he added.  Harland Dorrinson, a gym manager from Knoxville, Tennessee, had his own nightmarish experience with the Obamacare website. He had to log on to the site twice before finally obtaining health insurance for the first time in his life. Bitterly, he remarked, "President Obama promised affordable and accessible health care for millions of Americans. He didn't mention it would take over an hour."  The issues plaguing HealthCare.gov have elicited widespread frustration from a nation that has patiently awaited the arrival of comprehensive health insurance. As Americans continue to grapple with the website's technical problems, the promise of affordable and accessible health care seems to be slipping further away.”XÍ  Official Washington breathed a collective sigh of relief on New Year's Day, as it managed to avert what could have been a completely unnecessary crisis, one that was entirely of its own making. This latest deal highlights the peculiar ability of our elected officials to procrastinate until the eleventh hour and then, in a manner that leaves no one truly content, partially resolve a problem they themselves created. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, proudly acknowledged this feat while cautioning his colleagues against becoming complacent in the wake of their half-hearted solution.  As Senator McConnell basked in the glow of self-congratulation, he emphasized that the work is far from over. The arrival of a new year signals the need for renewed dedication and the realization that there is much left to accomplish. He implored his fellow lawmakers to begin crafting entirely new optional disasters, which they would inevitably have to undo in a haphazard manner at a later date. The senator's message was clear: in this era of political dysfunction, we must strive to concoct fresh challenges for ourselves, as if our collective well-being depends on it.  In a somewhat related development, an arsonist was recently honored for successfully extinguishing his own fire. This peculiar recognition serves as a metaphor for the current state of affairs in Washington, where the ability to create and resolve unnecessary crises has become the norm.”X	  In a world that often seems plagued by selfishness and despair, an extraordinary tale has emerged that restores faith in the inherent goodness of humanity. Amidst the relentless stream of news that can leave one disheartened, a recent incident involving the Curiosity Mars rover serves as a powerful reminder that there are still individuals willing to go above and beyond to help others.  Last Friday, at approximately 4:30 p.m. EST, the Curiosity rover found itself trapped in a ditch while conducting a routine soil analysis on the red planet. Mission control held its breath as engineers feverishly attempted to free the rover from its precarious situation. However, as minutes turned into agonizing moments, it became evident that the rover was unable to extricate itself unaided. Despair threatened to engulf the room.  Then, in a truly remarkable turn of events, an unidentified stranger sprang into action, fearlessly rushing to the rover's aid. With unwavering determination, this selfless individual successfully pulled the stranded module out of the treacherous ditch. Remarkably, he did not seek any recognition or reward for his noble act of heroism; instead, he continued on with his day, disappearing into the annals of anonymity.  Unfortunately, due to the 14-minute transmission lag between Mars and Earth, the rover's camera was unable to capture the identity of this extraordinary individual. By the time the camera was redirected towards him, he had vanished. Nevertheless, his actions have not gone unnoticed.  "The sight of this individual springing into action was nothing short of awe-inspiring," expressed Ralph Roe, NASA's chief engineer. "He could have easily chosen to pass by without lending a hand, but he made the conscious decision to stop and assist the rover. I yearn to know his name so that I may express my gratitude."  Thanks to this anonymous knight in shining armor, the Curiosity rover can now resume its vital mission to search for traces of water and microbial life on Mars. NASA, alongside the rest of the world, salutes this nameless hero and acknowledges the profound impact of his actions.  In a society where cynicism often prevails, it is essential to remember that good people do exist, capable of performing extraordinary acts of kindness and selflessness. While the news may frequently highlight the darker aspects of human nature, it is stories like these that rekindle our faith in humanity.”X-	  Apple Unveils iPhone 5 with Revolutionary Empathy Feature  In a groundbreaking announcement today, Apple unveiled the highly anticipated iPhone 5, sending shockwaves through the tech world. The new device introduces a remarkable feature that has the potential to transform lives previously devoid of meaning. At the product launch event, Apple highlighted the enhanced version of its personal assistant, Siri, which now possesses a quality previously absent in its predecessors: empathy.  During a captivating demonstration, Josh, an app developer, posed a deeply personal question to the new Siri: "Why didn't my parents love me?" Siri's response, delivered with a touch of emotional intelligence, left the audience at the Yerba Buena Center spellbound. "Your parents were too self-absorbed and narcissistic to recognize your essential beauty and value as a human being," Siri sympathetically replied, evoking an emotional response from the crowd.  The grand finale of the presentation came from Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, who made perhaps his boldest claim to date about the iPhone 5. He confidently declared, "We believe that the iPhone 5 will make your current relationship obsolete." This assertion sent shockwaves throughout Wall Street, with tech analysts predicting a surge in sales as millions of Apple customers rush to replace their significant others with the latest iPhone.  However, Tracy Klugian, a devoted Apple enthusiast attending the launch, provided a more tempered perspective. "Most Apple snobs I know started putting their Apple products before their relationships a long time ago," Klugian remarked, suggesting that expectations of relationship replacement may be overstated.  In the wake of this groundbreaking announcement, Wall Street experienced a rally as investors anticipated a significant boost in sales for Apple. Tech analysts predict that the iPhone 5 will revolutionize the way people interact with their devices and redefine the boundaries of personal connection.  Notably, satirist Andy Borowitz will be performing at two shows during the upcoming New Yorker Festival in October. On Friday, October 5th, he will be joining the storytelling group, The Moth, and on Saturday, October 6th, he will share the stage with comedian Sarah Silverman. Ticket information for these highly anticipated events is available here.”Xý  In a surprising turn of events, Silvio Berlusconi, the former Prime Minister of Italy, has expressed his interest in making a political comeback in the bustling city of New York. Citing his impressive approval ratings in recent local polls, Berlusconi announced his intentions today. For the disgraced politician, the opportunity to start fresh in New York is nothing short of a dream come true. Comparatively, Berlusconi noted that the Italian justice system is far less forgiving, as even a minor mistake can result in a lengthy jail sentence. In contrast, New Yorkers are known for their more forgiving nature.  While he has yet to decide on the specific office he will run for, Berlusconi is currently leaning towards the position of public advocate. With his trademark booming laugh, he quipped that once New Yorkers witness his prowess in that role, they will undoubtedly elect him as mayor or governor. The former Prime Minister seemed unperturbed by rumors of another former European politician, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also considering a bid for office in New York. Berlusconi confidently dismissed any concerns, stating that he has no worries and receives positive feedback from people on the streets who give him a thumbs up. According to him, New York loves Silvio.”X7  Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney released a letter today addressing his recent comments about poor people. In an effort to clarify his stance, Romney expressed his genuine concern for the impoverished population, drawing a comparison between his own financial status and that of Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook.  Romney humbly acknowledged that while he may not be considered poor by conventional standards, his net worth of approximately $200 million pales in comparison to Zuckerberg's projected personal fortune of $28 billion following Facebook's Initial Public Offering (I.P.O.). This stark contrast, in Romney's view, illustrates his relative financial disadvantage.  The former governor of Massachusetts dismissed any notion of envy towards Zuckerberg's immense wealth, emphasizing that he believes in the importance of acknowledging and appreciating the success achieved through hard work. Romney commended Zuckerberg for creating innovative products such as imaginary sheep and Angry Birds, which have undeniably transformed the way we spend our leisure time.  In an unexpected turn, Romney revealed his own venture into the world of social networking with the launch of his platform, TwoFaceBook. This new network, according to Romney, distinguishes itself by constantly changing users' profiles every two seconds. The candidate expressed hope that this innovative approach would attract users seeking a dynamic social media experience.  In closing, Romney assured the American people that his concerns about poverty were not misplaced, as he recognized the presence of Groupons as a means of financial relief for those in need. He urged voters to consider his perspective on poverty and promised to advocate for policies that would create opportunities for all Americans.  Ultimately, Romney's letter aimed to provide clarity on his position regarding poverty and to offer a unique perspective on the issue. As the presidential election approaches, his words shed light on his view of wealth disparity and his commitment to addressing the concerns of the less fortunate.”X›  In a move that has been widely criticized as a desperate ploy to divert media attention from Donald Trump, the remaining fifteen candidates vying for the Republican nomination have shocked the public by releasing a joint explicit video. This tape, featuring prominent figures such as former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Texas senator Ted Cruz, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, and New Jersey governor Chris Christie, briefly appeared on major news websites before being swiftly taken down due to overwhelming viewer disgust.  Carol Foyler, one of the unfortunate viewers who stumbled upon the video during its brief presence on the CNN website, expressed her shock and disbelief at the content. "The images I saw will be forever etched in my mind," she stated. Foyler further added, "I couldn't fathom why these individuals would stoop so low to participate in such a disgraceful act." Notably, she made an exception for Rick Santorum, suggesting that his involvement might not have come as a surprise.  A spokesperson for Rick Perry, another candidate seen in the tape, defended the former Texas governor's decision to participate. "It shifted the conversation, if only for a brief moment," the spokesperson commented. Despite this claim, it appears that the release of the controversial video has inadvertently provided a boost to Trump's popularity. Recent polls indicate an increase of eleven points in his favor, possibly due to his exclusion from the explicit footage.  It is important to note that the rule for using "fewer" and "less" has been widely debated. "Fewer" is typically reserved for countable items, like beans, while "less" is used for uncountable things like bacon.”X
  Kobe Bryant, a basketball legend with an impressive resume of 18 NBA All-Star selections, five league titles, and two Olympic gold medals, announced that he will retire at the end of this season. As he plays his final games, stars from around the league are reflecting on his remarkable career and sharing their thoughts on one of the greatest Lakers of all time.  Paul George, a player known for his aggressive style on the court, commended Bryant for his sportsmanship. George revealed that Bryant would ask his opponents about their dinner plans before every game, showing a level of gentility rarely seen in the sport. What stood out to George was that Bryant would remember these conversations even years later.  James Harden, another NBA star, expressed his gratitude towards Bryant for introducing him to the game of basketball. Harden humorously mentioned that without Bryant, he might have mistaken a basketball for a large orange egg from "The Flintstones" cartoon series.  Dwyane Wade, who faced Bryant countless times, acknowledged his dominance on the court but also had a humorous criticism. According to Wade, Bryant would shout, "One more melon in the berry bowl!" whenever he took a shot. Wade humorously pointed out that while melons are fruits, they are definitely not berries, which didn't sit well with him.  Kevin Garnett, a former NBA player, commented on Bryant's habit of giving nicknames to his opponents. Garnett humorously shared that Bryant gave everyone the same nickname, "Cowboy."  Tony Allen, who once guarded Bryant, praised his dedication to preparation. Allen recalled a moment when Bryant muttered a series of dates during their matchup. Curious, Allen later discovered that those dates were the birthdays of all his cousins. This incident showcased Bryant's attention to detail and knowledge of his opponents.  Dirk Nowitzki, a longtime friend of Bryant's, shared an anecdote that highlighted Bryant's sense of humor. Before a game, Bryant took Nowitzki to Johnny Rockets and insisted on treating him to as many orders of chili cheese fries as he wanted. When Nowitzki expressed concern about getting bloated before the game, Bryant was genuinely appalled. He reassured Nowitzki, expressing his love and friendship, and encouraged him to indulge. Unfortunately, Nowitzki ended up vomiting on the floor at the Staples Center due to the excessive fries.  Tim Duncan, recognized as one of the smartest players in the game, acknowledged Bryant's intelligence on the court. Duncan admired Bryant's ability to focus solely on the game, without being”X¹  In an attempt to address the backlash caused by his recent controversial remarks about women, Donald Trump suggested on Sunday that the question of whether women should be regarded as humans should be decided by individual states. During an interview on CBS's Face the Nation, Trump stated, "I wouldn't want to tell Texas whether women are humans, for example. They obviously have some very strong opinions about that." When directly asked if he considered women to be humans, Trump responded by saying, "It should be a case-by-case thing." Additionally, Trump criticized the media for what he perceived as a double standard in their coverage of his statements about women. "I can call a woman a pig and it's totally taken out of context," he asserted.  Unsurprisingly, Trump's latest comments drew sharp criticism from his primary rival, Senator Ted Cruz, who was campaigning in Wisconsin at the time. Cruz lambasted Trump for his failure to find a more subtle way to express the Republican Party's alleged anti-woman views. "Once again, Donald has utterly failed," Cruz exclaimed.  On a lighter note, readers might be interested to learn about the proud father of the Times Square fixture, the Naked Cowboy.”Xp  Kim Jong-un, the Supreme Leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, recently penned a letter addressed to the citizens of the world, expressing his concerns and advocating for the widespread possession of nuclear weapons. In his letter, he highlighted the historical threats faced by North Korea and the necessity of nuclear arms for their defense.  Citing his father, the revered Kim Jong-il, he asserted that the only solution to counteract a bad actor with nuclear weapons is a good actor with nuclear weapons. The Supreme Leader emphasized his own sense of security, knowing that a loaded nuclear silo is but a button's press away from his nightstand.  Recognizing his father's wisdom, Kim Jong-un contended that true global safety can only be achieved when every nation possesses nuclear weapons. He lamented the alleged plot by the United States government and its allies at the United Nations to disarm North Korea, asserting that such actions undermine the nation's right to self-defense.  To combat these perceived threats, Kim Jong-un announced the establishment of the Nuclear Retaliation Association, aimed at safeguarding the sovereign rights of every nation to engulf the world in a catastrophic inferno. As an incentive, he promised to waive the association's initiation fee and reward new members with a bumper sticker proclaiming, "Nuclear weapons don't kill people. People kill people who don't have nuclear weapons."  In conclusion, Kim Jong-un signed off with a casual "Peace out," leaving readers to contemplate the weight of his words and the potential implications of his call for a world armed with nuclear weapons.”X#  House Speaker John Boehner made a public statement today, urging for an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for affluent individuals, effectively terminating a brief period of collaborative efforts with President Obama. This comes as no surprise to political analysts, who anticipated the Speaker's inability to maintain a cooperative stance for an extended period. Carol Foyler, a representative from Guinness World Records, commented on Boehner's track record, stating, "We were aware that he would not be able to sustain this faÃ§ade for long. However, it is worth acknowledging that Boehner's ability to feign bipartisanship for forty-eight hours is quite remarkable." Foyler went on to highlight that this achievement surpasses his previous record of maintaining a pretense for a mere twenty minutes, likening his accomplishment to that of renowned illusionist David Blaine. During a press conference, Speaker Boehner downplayed the significance of his record-breaking feat, modestly stating, "It simply feels gratifying to return to my assertive stance."”Xj   Cardinal Bonifacius Steuer had envisioned last night as a momentous occasion, a time of jubilation when his lifelong dream of becoming Pope would finally be realized. Standing on the balcony at the Vatican, the Dutchman from Rotterdam would revel in the adulation of thousands of faithful followers. However, today there are no exultant cheers for Steuer, only a resounding silence that forces him to contemplate what could have been.  In his first interview since his disappointing defeat, Cardinal Steuer admitted, "Look, I won't deceive you. It pains me not to be there, not to be at the Vatican fulfilling my duties." While he refrained from engaging in the blame game, there was a tinge of bitterness in his words when discussing the mainstream media. "They distorted my image, portraying me as a wealthy individual, when in reality, I live a modest life," he lamented.  Steuer believes that Pope Francis triumphed by championing a failed policy of the past: reaching out to the poor. "If you constantly harp on about the poor, you'll naturally garner support from those who desire handouts," he argued. Reflecting on the conclave that selected someone else, Steuer adopted a philosophical stance. "It was a roller coaster ride, filled with exhilarating highs and disheartening lows. But every ride has an end, and we must disembark. We cannot expect to live on a roller coaster forever."  While Steuer remained tight-lipped about his future plans, he expressed the intention to confer with his closest advisors to analyze his shortcomings. "I will sit down with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost and implore them to be candid with me," he declared. Despite his grievances about the hand he was dealt, Steuer reserved his harshest criticism for himself. "Ultimately, the blame lies with me," he admitted. "This was all about securing enough Catholic votes, and I failed to achieve that."”X  Fans of the universally adored Muppets are in for an extraordinary treat as the unpublished early journals of their creator, the legendary Jim Henson, have been recently unveiled by his estate. These captivating chronicles offer a profound insight into the genesis and evolution of the adored characters we have come to cherish. Prepare to be enthralled by the sheer brilliance contained within these pages.  It is truly remarkable to fathom that nearly half a century has elapsed since the composition of this remarkable journal, and yet Jim Henson's Muppets continue to captivate and delight families across the globe. The release of this journal is an unparalleled opportunity to delve into the imaginative realm of one of the most prodigious creative minds in the annals of television.”XA	  At precisely 8:13 p.m. on Monday, as the credits of Halloween: Resurrection began to roll, Joseph Condron succumbed to a flood of tears. But these were not tears of sorrow; rather, tears of sheer elation. At the age of 43, Condron had just etched his name in the annals of history, becoming the first human ever to conquer Mount Everest while simultaneously watching all 10 installments of the Halloween horror film series. A feat so extraordinary, it defied imagination.  Condron's accomplishment stands alone, unrivaled by any mountaineer or film enthusiast in existence. To achieve this remarkable feat, he had to brave the treacherous ascent of over 29,000 vertical feet and endure a staggering 920 minutes of spine-chilling cinema. And let's not forget that descending Everest can prove even more arduous than the initial climb itself. It is no wonder, then, that Condron's triumph was long believed to be an impossibility.  Others have come close to this elusive goal. Renowned American mountaineer Ed Viesturs has conquered Everest on seven occasions, while also managing to experience the spine-tingling Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers in 1995. The United Kingdom's own Paul Noble has also conquered Everest, all while indulging in six out of the 10 Halloween movies. These individuals' achievements are undeniably impressive, but they must now yield the spotlight to Condron's extraordinary feat.  Condron's monumental accomplishment stands as a testament to his unwavering determination and resilience. It is difficult to fathom the sheer audacity of his endeavor, especially when considering the current cinematic landscape with a staggering 10 Halloween films. A towering mountain and 10 films may seem utterly ludicrous, and indeed, there were moments when it appeared that Condron may fall short of his daunting quest.  However, it was during this critical juncture, with the release of Rob Zombie's Halloween in 2007, that Condron embarked on an awe-inspiring run of achievements. He swiftly devoured the Rob Zombie reboot in early 2008, followed by Halloween III: Season Of The Witch (1982) in 2009. Then, in 2010, Condron scaled the majestic heights of Mount Everest for the first time. Finally, in 2012, he witnessed the enthralling Halloween II (2009), leaving only Halloween: Resurrection (2002) as the final hurdle between Condron and his imm”XŠ   In a nation brimming with approximately three hundred million individuals, the United States of America has steadfastly embraced the notion that only two families hold the key to the White House. Through extensive interviews conducted nationwide, Americans have come to acknowledge that although the country houses numerous exceptional figures in technology, business, public policy, and government, none shall be presented as viable candidates to voters simply because they do not hail from one of the anointed two families. "Undoubtedly, there are countless remarkable individuals out there who could potentially serve as President," mused Stoddard Vinton of Toledo. "Yet, I suppose our system of exclusively selecting candidates from these two families has proven itself quite successful." Leslie McEdwards of San Jose concurred, adding, "While it would indeed be intriguing to choose a President from a wider pool, the advantage lies in the fact that we voters are spared the arduous task of acquainting ourselves with a plethora of unfamiliar names."   Nevertheless, Doug Chessing of Grand Rapids voiced his concerns, stating, "Our nation is confronted with unprecedented challenges, and it will require fresh ideas to resolve them. I am keeping my fingers crossed that someone from these two families can rise to the occasion." Halynn Cross of Knoxville echoed this sentiment, noting, "Although Barack Obama, the current President, did not belong to either of these families, it always felt somewhat peculiar to me. He exerted great effort, but after eight years, it will be a relief to have someone from the two families once again."   In an emphatic endorsement of America's two-family system, Rick Keelins of Albany vehemently expressed his exasperation with those who criticize it. "At least we have two families to choose from," he retorted. "Numerous countries, like North Korea, are constrained to a solitary option."”Xˆ  Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader, has recently checked into a rehabilitation facility to address his ongoing difficulties with nouns and verbs, confirmed an aide to the congressman. The aide explained that McCarthy's struggles with these fundamental aspects of speech had escalated to such a degree that he abruptly withdrew from the Speaker of the House race. It was during an intervention, where individuals close to McCarthy gathered to express their concern, that he was shown videos of himself speaking. The congressman acknowledged the need for assistance, although it took some time for those involved to fully comprehend his message.  A source familiar with McCarthy's challenges, however, expressed skepticism regarding the official account. According to this source, it is not solely nouns and verbs that present difficulties for McCarthy, but also adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns. Consequently, it is expected that McCarthy will remain in rehab for an extended period of time.  McCarthy himself provided a succinct evaluation of his situation in a brief statement to reporters. "It's bad," he acknowledged, "but soon it will be less bad."”XŽ  In a surprising turn of events, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey took matters into his own hands on Sunday night, declaring himself a medical doctor in response to constant questioning of his medical credentials. Dr. Christie, as he is now known, admitted that typical medical training involves pre-med classes, four years of medical school, and additional years of residency. However, he justified his unorthodox path by citing the urgency of the Ebola epidemic.  Dr. Christie announced that he would commence a series of random house calls on Monday to assess New Jersey residents for Ebola and assign them to quarantine if necessary. "I can usually diagnose someone with Ebola in under a minute," Dr. Christie confidently stated, noting that his diagnosis skills were even faster when he didn't actually see the patient.  Before implementing his quarantine plan, Dr. Christie consulted with prominent epidemiologists, including Dr. Rick Perry from Texas, who supported his approach. "He concurs," Dr. Christie affirmed.  Facing criticism for his unconventional methods, Dr. Christie defended his quarantine plan by pointing out that innovative procedures in medicine often encounter initial opposition. "We're accustomed to hearing that the nurses and doctors treating Ebola patients are heroes," he argued. "But the real heroes are the ones who lock up those heroes."  Dr. Christie's bold move has generated mixed reactions, with some questioning the legitimacy of his sudden medical expertise. Only time will tell if his unique approach to combating the Ebola epidemic will prove effective or if it will further contribute to the ongoing debate surrounding the crisis.”X  In a grand and opulent gesture to bid farewell to the Michael Bloomberg era, the former three-term mayor of New York City received lavish accolades last night from his most privileged constituents: those who can still afford to reside in the city. Harland Dorrinson, the principal owner of hedge fund Garrote Capital, hosted an extravagant black-tie dinner in the vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, paying tribute to a mayor who, according to Dorrinson, made living in New York a privilege reserved solely for the deserving few.  While many attribute Mike Bloomberg's legacy to his efforts in reducing smoking and improving diets, Dorrinson believes that these achievements should not overshadow his greatest accomplishment: making housing in New York City unattainable for the majority. "When Mike took office, this city was populated by regular working people," Mr. Dorrinson reminisced, visibly disturbed by the memory. "Today, it is a magnificent tapestry of investment bankers, real estate developers, and Russian oligarchs."  Such is Mr. Dorrinson's adoration for Bloomberg that he has only one grievance: the former mayor left office too soon, leaving the task unfinished. "There are still a few unfortunate pockets in the city where the middle class seems to persist," he lamented. "The rent is simply too low."  As for Bloomberg's critics, Mr. Dorrinson remains philosophical. "I am aware that there are some who believe Mike was detrimental to New York, that he destroyed its rich diversity. Fortunately, they have all relocated elsewhere now."”•¾      Xó  Mitt Romney, the Republican Party's candidate for the presidency, received a much-needed boost today as he emerged ahead of President Obama in a survey conducted among NFL replacement referees. The poll, carried out during NFL games last Sunday and Monday, instantly lifted the spirits of the Romney campaign. The results of the survey indicated that if the election were to be held today, Mr. Romney would outperform President Obama, with a score of 14-12. A significant majority of the replacement referees strongly concurred with the statement, expressing their need for further consultation before making a final decision. This news comes as a welcome relief for the Romney campaign, which has been grappling with a series of setbacks in recent weeks.”XÕ   New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner sparked a fresh wave of controversy today as he unabashedly continued to send explicit text messages during a press conference dedicated to apologizing for his past behavior. Mr. Weiner, in a display of shocking audacity, was only halfway through expressing his remorse when eagle-eyed reporters caught sight of him discreetly extracting a phone from his pocket. Unmistakably, he directed the camera lens towards his lower body. The candidate proceeded to snap a photograph of his pants region and promptly send a text message, leaving the press corps stunned.  Reporters wasted no time in seizing the opportunity to interrogate Mr. Weiner, demanding clarification on whether he had indeed engaged in sexting right then and there. The embattled candidate, though caught red-handed, mustered the audacity to admit his transgression, asserting that this would be his final indiscretion. "Yes, I did, but I swear this was the last time," he professed, attempting to assuage the outrage. "This behavior is now behind me," Mr. Weiner added, desperately hoping to restore his tarnished image.  In a finale that can only be described as brazen, Mr. Weiner concluded the press conference by astonishingly removing his shirt and hastily capturing an image of his unclothed torso. The shock and disbelief among those in attendance were palpable.  Despite the scandal-ridden journey that Mr. Weiner has embarked upon, it appears that his actions have not completely eroded his support among a particular cohort of voters. According to the most recent poll conducted in New York City, Mr. Weiner still maintains a commanding lead among those who, rather disconcertingly, choose to identify themselves as "pervs."  As the race for New York City's mayoral seat intensifies, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Weiner's brazen disregard for decorum and persistent controversies will ultimately spell his political demise or if he will somehow manage to salvage his candidacy.”Xà  ISIS Continues Reign of Brutality with Attack on Beloved Sitcom  In yet another display of its merciless and conscienceless nature, ISIS has once again shocked the world with its latest devastating attack. The extremist organization released a video this morning that has left viewers horrified. The footage features the popular sitcom Friends, but with a disturbing twist: the laugh track has been replaced by an unknown voice making derogatory remarks about one of the show's main characters, Ross.  The video, which can be viewed below (although viewer discretion is strongly advised), is truly chilling. It serves as a stark reminder of just how far this terrorist group is willing to go in its pursuit of spreading fear and chaos.   The Islamic State has repeatedly proven its unwavering commitment to depravity, as demonstrated by the destruction of sacred cultural sites and the brutal murder of innocent civilians. Yet, even in the face of such atrocities, this latest attack manages to shock and disturb.  As the world watches in horror, it is clear that the reign of terror orchestrated by ISIS must be stopped. The international community can only hope that someone will rise to the occasion and put an end to this unrelenting brutality.”Xz  Title: Ohio Man's Unusual Obsession Alienates Loved Ones  Byline: By [Author's Name]  CINCINNATI - Harland Dorrinson, a 41-year-old carpet-tile salesman from Ohio, has found himself isolated from friends and family due to his unwavering preoccupation with the so-called fiscal cliff. Former friends of Mr. Dorrinson attest to his peculiar fascination with perhaps the most tedious conversation topic in existence.  "We were all like, 'Harland, every time you talk about this, people start to lose consciousness'," says Carol Foyler, a former friend who has severed ties with Mr. Dorrinson over his fiscal-cliff obsession. "I don't know what impact the fiscal cliff will have in January, but if you're trapped in a conversation with Harland, the effect is that you want to drown yourself."  In response, Mr. Dorrinson claims that his ex-friends, who have shown no interest in the fiscal cliff, are simply uninformed individuals missing out on something significant. "I suppose there are people out there who aren't interested in whether capital-gains taxes and marginal rates will rise, or which Republicans have distanced themselves from Grover Norquist's anti-tax pledge," he says. "But honestly, would you want to be friends with someone like that? Or even marry one?"  If Mr. Dorrinson harbors any regrets, it is that the fiscal-cliff issue will inevitably be resolved by the end of the year. "I know I'm going to experience a profound feeling of loss when it's gone," he laments. "There hasn't been anything this captivating since the debt-ceiling debate."  For those interested, tickets for Andy Borowitz's next live show are now available for purchase.”XÚ  Coleridge Elementary, an underprivileged school in Detroit, has faced numerous challenges over the years. Limited funds prevented the school from acquiring essential supplies such as textbooks and computers, while faculty cuts led to overcrowded classrooms with more than 30 students per teacher. However, a recent turn of events has brought hope to this struggling institution: a philanthropic timpani player, Eric Gustav, has generously donated a staggering $60 million to establish a world-class timpani program at the school. This remarkable act of benevolence has garnered praise and admiration.  Eric Gustav, an ardent timpani enthusiast and heir to a vast fortune, recognized the school's plight and decided to provide a solution. Prior to his extraordinary donation, Coleridge Elementary's timpani program consisted of a single dilapidated timpani, with only one mallet for all 900 students to shareâ€”well below the national average. However, thanks to Gustav's contribution, the school now leads the way in timpani education, and it is all thanks to one man's vision.  During a public ceremony held at the school, Eric Gustav expressed his childhood experience of never having to worry about access to a timpani. He firmly believes that every child, regardless of their financial means, should have the privilege of experiencing the joy of timpanis. His words resonated with the audience, emphasizing the magnanimity of his gesture.  The impact of the grant on the school's timpani classes has been transformative. Each student now has access to a top-of-the-line timpani, manufactured in a prestigious 100-year-old Italian drum factory. Additionally, the school has been able to employ 25 full-time timpani tutors and invite guest speakers from leading philharmonics worldwide. To further enhance the program, the school acquired an adjacent lot to construct an 800-seat concert hall dedicated to timpani practice and recitals.  Just last week, the future appeared bleak for the students of Coleridge Elementary. However, thanks to one man's remarkable generosity, their prospects for learning and playing the timpani have undergone a remarkable change. This act of goodwill serves as a testament to the enduring existence of kindness in our world. Bravo!”X¾  In an effort to address concerns surrounding his proposed military intervention in Syria, President Obama presented a more modest strategy today, suggesting that any U.S. action in the region would lack any clear objective. Speaking in a CNN interview, the President emphasized, "Let me be clear," stating that the goal would not involve regime change, altering the power dynamics, or bringing an end to the ongoing civil war in Syria. Instead, he outlined a plan to carry out a random operation for one or two days before promptly withdrawing. Seeking to reassure both allies and the Syrian people, Obama asserted, "What we are about to undertake, if we undertake it at all, will have no purpose or goal." This aligns with previous U.S. foreign policies.  Although President Obama hoped that his proposal for a brief and purposeless intervention would alleviate concerns within the international community, it was met with immediate opposition from U.S. allies. They argued that a two-day timeframe for such a mission was too open-ended. In response to this criticism, White House spokesman Jay Carney briefed reporters later in the day, suggesting that the President was open to scaling down the mission to 24 hours, or at most, 36 hours. Carney explained, "Maybe we get in there, take a look around, and get out right away. But regardless of the duration, one thing remains constant: this mission will serve no purpose." The President remains resolute in this stance.”XM  In an extraordinary turn of events, Lady Luck has bestowed her blessings upon Jason and Brooke Ashby, a couple residing in Philadelphia. Their unassuming two-bedroom house experienced a miraculous surge in value when Billy Joel inadvertently found himself glued to their porch. The renowned Piano Man was discovered early Saturday morning, frantically attempting to detach his forehead from the front porch. However, despite his valiant efforts, Joel remained firmly stuck, prompting the Ashbys to summon an appraiser. To their astonishment, the expert valued their abode at more than three times its original purchase price. A windfall indeed!  Ever since this fortuitous incident, the Ashby residence has become the object of envy within the neighborhood, with neighbors flocking to catch a glimpse of the rock-and-roll legend in the flesh. "When we acquired this place, the thought of stumbling upon a music icon glued to our domicile never entered our minds," Jason gleefully remarked, his smile stretching from ear to ear. "And never in our wildest dreams did we anticipate it would be someone as iconic as Billy Joel. It has truly been a godsend."  Whether Joel is battling in vain to liberate himself or thirstily imbibing rainwater, the six-time Grammy Award winner has already added an additional digit to the property's value. As for the Ashbys, they face a decision: capitalize on their newfound fortune by selling now or patiently await the possibility of further skyrocketing prices. Regardless, there is no denying that Jason and Brooke Ashby now rank among the most fortuitous individuals on earth.”Xy  Senate Republicans Refuse to Create Jobs, Risking Election Year Backlash  In a surprising move, Senate Republicans have chosen to prioritize their political agenda over job creation, thwarting any attempts to fill vacant positions this week. This decision has raised questions among voters nationwide, who are puzzled by the party's refusal to allow even a single American to secure employment. The Republicans' actions have also sparked speculation among Washington insiders, who believe that GOP senators are reluctant to contribute to the improving jobs market under President Barack Obama's leadership.  "Contradicting their professed interest in creating jobs, Senate Republicans resolutely refused to put even one American to work this week," said Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. He pointed out that the party's obstructionist tactics undermine their claims of job creation. "You have a job opening and a highly qualified applicant, but you're blocking the applicant from taking the job? That doesn't sound like you're very interested in creating jobs," Secretary Perez added.  Notably, the Republican leadership's decision to impede job growth comes at a time when the economy has added over nine million jobs under President Obama. This raises suspicions among analysts that the GOP senators are reluctant to give the President any credit, especially during an election year. "The last thing the Republicans want to do is give him credit for one more," revealed an insider familiar with Senate proceedings.  Sources within the Senate have suggested that the Republican leadership hopes the job applicant, a sixty-three-year-old male, will eventually become discouraged and abandon their search for employment. This move is seen as a strategic attempt to undermine the positive trend in job creation during the Obama administration.  While many professionals in the field, including copy editors, journalists, grammarians, lexicographers, and linguists, are embracing the use of the singular "their," we stand firm in our position against it. The New York Times remains committed to traditional grammatical standards and will not adopt this linguistic trend.”Xø  In a bid to clarify the confusion surrounding the declaration of war against ISIS, the White House made an effort on Friday afternoon to emphasize its commitment by vowing to employ every possible synonym for war at its disposal. This pronouncement followed a series of contradictory statements, beginning with Secretary of State John Kerry's assertion that the United States was not engaged in war, only to be later contradicted by the White House's affirmation that it indeed was. In an attempt to address this discrepancy, White House spokesman Josh Earnest held a press conference, affirming that no synonyms for war had been dismissed as options. "Yes, this is a war," Earnest asserted. "But it is also a conflict, a campaign, a struggle, a fracas, and, if you will, a melee." He further clarified that Secretary Kerry's position and the White House's stance were not contradictory. "While Secretary Kerry stated that there was no war and we stated that there was, we are all in agreement that hostilities will take place," Earnest explained. Looking ahead, Earnest mentioned that the White House would decide on the most appropriate term to refer to the enemy in the coming days: whether it be ISIS, ISIL, the Islamic State, or an entirely different name altogether.”X,  In a stunning turn of events, Ted Cruz, despite his relatively strong showing in the Republican primary elections, announced today that he is suspending his campaign for president. The reason? Cruz expressed a deep and emotional commitment to tending to his thousands of glistening eggs. This unexpected twist has sent shockwaves through the political landscape, leaving pundits and observers scrambling to make sense of it all.  Speaking at a press conference in St. Louis, Cruz made it clear that his eggs were his top priority. "I believe that I could have admirably served the American people as president," he said, visibly emotional. "But at the end of the day, my throbbing, glistening eggs come first." Cruz went on to explain the time-consuming process of keeping his eggs wet with Sprite soda, a task that required his constant attention. "I cannot, in good conscience, continue my bid for the presidency when I know that twice every hour I need to go into my garage, where my thousands of throbbing eggs shimmer in the dim headlights of the minivan I keep idling at all times, and I need to moisten them with Sprite soda from a spray bottle. My eggs have got to be wet with Sprite soda. I'm sorry."  During the Q&A session that followed his announcement, a supporter asked why Cruz couldn't entrust someone else to care for his eggs until the election was over. Cruz responded firmly, explaining the various responsibilities he had towards his eggs. "I need to sing hymns to my eggs, I need to keep them safe from cockroaches and other predators, I need to count them, and I need to keep them wet with Sprite soda. Most importantly, when they hatch, I need to be there so that the hatchlings can devour my body. It has to be me."  The impact of Cruz's decision on the remaining presidential hopefuls is yet to be seen. With one less candidate in the GOP pool, the dynamics of the race have shifted. The 2016 presidential primary season continues to defy expectations, rewriting the rules in the process. Observers eagerly await what lies ahead in this unprecedented election cycle.”XÎ  Get ready to mark your calendars, because an extraordinary opportunity is on the horizon. Soon, individuals all across the nation will have the chance to immerse themselves in a fragment of American history that may typically seem inaccessible. Arlington National Cemetery is embarking on a unique journey, and it just might be heading to your town! Residents from Dallas to Detroit will be granted the opportunity to visit the cemetery and pay their respects at revered landmarks, such as the USS Maine Memorial, JFK's eternal flame, and the gravesites of more than 400,000 American servicemen. The grand tour is scheduled to make an astonishing 50 stops during its national expedition, culminating in a week-long exhibition at New York's iconic Madison Square Garden.  "Here in D.C., we are fortunate to have the ease of visiting Arlington whenever we desire," remarked Chuck Cartwright, the executive director of the Procession Of Heroes tour. "Now, millions of Americans will have the privilege to experience this national treasure firsthand. From the meticulously aligned rows of white crosses on the main lawn to the revered Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, we are ecstatic to offer the entire nation an opportunity to pay homage to the unwavering dedication and sacrifices of these courageous individuals."

The University of Minnesota's Opinion Research Institute conducted the poll, which revealed that the candidate, commonly referred to as "Muslim Question Guy," is leading the GOP field with thirty-four percent of the vote, while Trump trails behind with nineteen percent. Republicans participating in the survey commended Muslim Question Guy for his assertion that President Obama is neither Christian nor American, criticizing Trump for his lack of vocal agreement on these points. Shortly after the poll results were made public, Trump launched an offensive against Muslim Question Guy during an appearance on CNN. The business tycoon questioned the knowledge of those supporting the rival candidate, stating, "People who are supporting this guy haven't done their homework. If you look back over the past seven years, no one has called Obama a foreign-born Muslim more often than I have." Despite Trump's efforts, Muslim Question Guy's momentum remains unaffected. In fact, the candidate drew an impressive crowd of four thousand people at his inaugural campaign rally in Concord, New Hampshire, where he pledged to reclaim the nation from Muslim clockmakers.”XS  In a nail-biting victory during Super Tuesday's pivotal Ohio primary, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney triumphed by a hair's breadth. Moments after his win, an elated Romney addressed his supporters in Boston, brimming with confidence. "Tonight, I stand before you as the individual who is slightly less despised than Rick Santorum," he declared. Romney expressed his hope to carry this marginal advantage all the way to the Republican convention in Tampa, capitalizing on the momentum it would provide.  Romney stressed that the voters of Ohio had made it clear they preferred the lesser of two evils. "I am the lesser," he proclaimed to the enthusiastic crowd. However, despite his victory, the Santorum camp showed no signs of conceding defeat. Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum highlighted his wins in states like Oklahoma and Tennessee, proudly asserting that voters resoundingly expressed their intense dislike for Romney. "They can't stand Mitt more than they detest me," Santorum confidently declared, interpreting the results as a recipe for his success.  Similarly, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich vowed to continue his campaign, undeterred by his opponents' victories. Gingrich, who hails from Georgia, emphasized that voters in his home state harbored greater disdain for both Romney and Santorum than they did for him. "This race isn't about winning or losing," Gingrich remarked. "It's about affording me the opportunity to stand in front of a microphone and revel in the sound of my own voice for as long as possible."  Meanwhile, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin hinted at a potential role for herself if the Republican contest reached a deadlock. Palin reminded the public of her historic contribution to the race, claiming it was her lowering of the bar that made this Republican contest possible.  As the candidates maneuvered and strategized their way through the grueling primary season, one thing remained clear: the race for the Republican nomination was far from over. With each candidate holding onto hope, their individual ambitions and aspirations continued to shape the path ahead.”X-  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled new software on Thursday at the company's headquarters that he claims will revolutionize the way people waste their time. The software, called Home, is designed to take over users' phones and render them useless for anything other than Facebook, much like many Facebook users themselves. Zuckerberg proudly announced that Home will bombard users with constant status updates, transforming Facebook from a social network into something resembling a neurological disorder.  During the presentation, Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook users still had a few hours a day when they were leading somewhat healthy and productive lives. However, he assured the audience that Home would change that by effectively eliminating any semblance of a life. He emphasized that his team had spent months developing the software, aiming to be "a million voices inside your head."  One audience member expressed concern about the potential invasion of privacy that Home might entail. Zuckerberg responded by suggesting that after using Home for several weeks, users would have no life left to invade. While proud of his latest creation, Zuckerberg made it clear that he had no intention of resting on his laurels, stating that at Facebook, their goal is to replace real experiences with something soulless and empty.  The unveiling of Home marks another step in Facebook's ongoing quest for dominance in the digital world. With this software, the company hopes to further cement its influence over users' lives, leaving them with little time for anything else.”XÔ   In a surprising announcement on state television, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un expressed his belief that international pop sensation Justin Bieber is merely a few brushes with the law away from becoming his dear friend. Speaking directly to the camera, Kim extended a heartfelt message to the pop star, urging him to consider the offer. "Justin, if you are watching right now, this is my message to you," Kim stated, emphasizing his eagerness to establish a close bond. The capricious dictator revealed his intentions to enlist Mr. Bieber's assistance in revitalizing North Korea's struggling pop-music industry, which pales in comparison to the globally renowned hits produced by their neighbors in South Korea, such as the iconic "Gangnam Style."  Kim Jong-un went on to propose an intriguing role for the Canadian artist, suggesting that he could serve as North Korea's Minister of Culture. This move, he believes, would breathe new life into the nation's creative landscape, fostering a more vibrant and prosperous musical industry. While acknowledging the concerns expressed by Bieber's devoted fan base regarding the singer's recent controversial behavior, the North Korean leader sought to assuage their worries. "He is heading to North Korea," Kim proclaimed, confidently asserting that such a move would ultimately prove beneficial for the young artist.  The proposition put forth by Kim Jong-un, while undoubtedly unconventional, underscores the leader's relentless pursuit of bolstering his nation's cultural standing on the global stage. As North Korea continues to grapple with numerous challenges, including economic stagnation and international isolation, Kim's overtures toward Justin Bieber reveal an unorthodox strategy to leverage the reach and influence of Western pop culture to invigorate his own country's artistic landscape. Only time will tell if Bieber will accept the North Korean leader's invitation and embark on a path that may forever alter the trajectory of his career.”X  In a nation grappling with the looming threat of an Ebola outbreak, a startling sentiment has emerged among a faction of Americans: the fear that science might become their saving grace. Through a series of interviews conducted across the country, prominent figures in the anti-science movement have expressed their concerns about the possibility of the American people, gripped by anxiety over the potential spread of the virus, turning to science in a desperate attempt to find a solution.  Harland Dorrinson, a well-known activist against scientific advancements hailing from Springfield, Missouri, believes this inclination towards science is a deeply human response driven by fear. "Under enough stress, even the most rational individuals will succumb to panic and begin placing their faith in science," Dorrinson remarked during our conversation. He further worries about a dangerous progression towards reliance on facts, as he envisions a slippery slope where belief in science could lead to belief in math, ultimately fostering an alarming dependence on objective truths.  Nonetheless, Dorrinson maintains a glimmer of hope, fervently desiring that this doomsday scenario never materializes. "Time and time again throughout history, Americans have been exposed to scientific discoveries and steadfastly refused to embrace them," he asserted. "I pray that this time, we will once again reject the allure of science."”Xû
  Republican National Committee Provides Tips for Delegates to Pretend to Like Mitt Romney  In preparation for the 2012 Republican National Convention, the Republican National Committee has released a confidential memo containing helpful tips for delegates on how to appear enthusiastic about Mitt Romney, despite any personal reservations they may have. The memo acknowledges that many delegates have already made up their minds about Romney, but emphasizes the importance of presenting a united front to the American people.  The memo acknowledges that the eyes of the world, particularly the liberal-dominated media, will be watching the convention closely. It warns delegates to be cautious of media attempts to exploit any signs of wavering support for Romney, except when they are trying to provoke discussions about sensitive issues such as rape.  The primary goal of the memo is not to convince delegates to genuinely like Mitt Romney, but rather to secure a victory in the November elections and protect the values that our nation's founders fought for, including controversial measures such as mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds.  The memo offers several suggestions for delegates to feign enthusiasm for Romney. Firstly, it advises delegates to immediately applaud or cheer whenever the name "Mitt Romney" is mentioned, in order to eliminate any awkward silence. Secondly, it suggests visualizing something or someone that the delegates genuinely love whenever they hear Romney's name. This exercise can be done anywhere, even in the privacy of their hotel rooms or cars.  Additionally, the memo announces coaching seminars on fake smiling and squealing, to be led by Flo from Progressive insurance. These seminars, scheduled to begin on Monday morning at the Tampa Marriott, will include light refreshments and amphetamines.  The memo also acknowledges that some delegates may find it difficult to suppress their negative emotions towards Romney. In a surprising twist, it encourages delegates to embrace their true feelings and even cry openly when Romney's name is mentioned. The memo suggests that television viewers may interpret this as a sign of overwhelming love for Romney.  In order to help delegates improve their crying skills, the memo provides a DVD of Michael Phelps's mother, Debbie, at the London Olympics, as well as footage of Kim Jong-il's funeral.  Finally, the memo advises delegates to think of Rick Santorum, a former Republican candidate, in order to maintain their focus and enthusiasm during the convention.  Overall, the memo emphasizes the importance of unity and putting on a convincing show of support for Mitt Romney, regardless of personal opinions. It remains to be seen how successful these tips will be in shaping public perception of the Republican Party's nominee.”XH  St. Dominics Soup Kitchen in Weehawken, NJ has taken it upon themselves to spread some holiday cheer by enhancing the flavor of their soups.

The incident has raised serious concerns regarding the efficacy of White House security measures. Not only was the intruder able to gain access to the White House and even enter the Lincoln Bedroom, but he also proceeded to teach the president basic guitar chords and even the opening riff to Cream's "Sunshine Of Your Love" before his presence was detected. The magnitude of this security failure is undeniable, and it is clear that accountability measures need to be taken.  Following the guitar lesson, where the intruder taught President Obama the names of guitar strings as well as the C-major and A-minor scales, the Secret Service issued an apology, shouldering the responsibility for the incident. However, a mere apology may not suffice. A chronological breakdown of the guitar lesson reveals the gravity of this security breach:  7:32 a.m.: A masked intruder successfully scales the White House fence and gains entry through an unlocked utility door, primarily used by maintenance staff. 7:43 a.m.: The intruder navigates a service tunnel, accessing the main hall of the White House. 7:52 a.m.: Unattended by Secret Service, the intruder locates President Obama in the Lincoln Bedroom. 8:00 a.m.: The intruder allows the president to borrow a subpar nylon-string acoustic guitar. 8:06 a.m.: Displaying remarkable skill, the intruder performs an impressive solo, showcasing the potential that lies in dedicated guitar practice. 8:12 a.m.: The intruder imparts knowledge about the guitar strings, using the acronym "Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good-Bye Eddie" to aid the president's memorization. 8:16 a.m.: The intruder inquires whether the president is more inclined towards rock or jazz. 8:18 a.m.: President Obama receives a lesson on playing the E-major, A-major, and D-major chords. 8:25 a.m.: The intruder makes an ambitious attempt to teach the president an F-major bar chord. 8:32 a.m.: Recognizing the challenge, the intruder encourages the discouraged president to work on the F-major bar chord independently after the lesson. 8:35 a.m.: The intruder imparts the opening riff of Cream's "Sunshine Of Your Love" to President Obama, who proceeds to repeat it for the next ten minutes. 8:45 a.m.: Secret”X³  North Korea Faces Humiliation as It is Expelled from the Axis of Evil  In a major blow to North Korea's reputation, the reclusive nation has been expelled from the Axis of Evil just hours after a failed rocket launch. The decision was made by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who presides over the group, citing North Korea's lack of evil as the reason for its expulsion.  President Ahmadinejad expressed his disappointment, stating that there are numerous evil countries, including Iran, who are actively developing nuclear weapons to instill fear in the world. He argued that North Korea's unsuccessful rocket launch only makes it harder for the rest of the Axis of Evil countries to maintain their credibility.  A spokesperson for North Korea vehemently objected to President Ahmadinejad's statement, claiming that it was unfair to judge the country's evilness based on one failed rocket launch. The membership in the Axis of Evil is highly valued by rogue nations like North Korea, as it enhances their reputation as a threat to the global community. Therefore, being expelled from the group is a significant setback.  The failed rocket launch has undoubtedly damaged North Korea's credibility in terms of its evilness, according to an aide to North Korean President Kim Jong-un. The aide further revealed that their attempts to intimidate Japan were met with no response, as the message went straight to voice mail. In a possible indication of reduced ambitions, North Korea resorted to hurling a roll of toilet paper over the border at South Korea.  President Ahmadinejad refrained from commenting on the latest incident on the Korean Peninsula, simply remarking that the entire situation is rather sad.”X  In an unprecedented turn of events at the White House, President Obama made an extraordinary request today, urging his staff to start including him in all email correspondence. Addressing his team in the Oval Office, the President acknowledged that some may consider him too busy to be bothered, but insisted on being copied nonetheless. "It is imperative for me to remain informed about the happenings within these walls," he stressed. "It is disconcerting when I turn on the news and find myself unaware of developments at the White House."  Expressing his belief that being cc'd would rectify this situation, Mr. Obama suggested a simple solution to avoid oversight: "Perhaps, a Post-It note on your computer saying 'CC POTUS' would serve as a gentle reminder," he offered as the meeting concluded. Following the discussion, the President confided in his aides, expressing his optimism about the outcome and his eagerness to be kept in the loop. Unfortunately, sources reveal that Mr. Obama's mood soured later in the day when he discovered his email address had been omitted from a message titled "Things the Treasury Dept. Is Planning to Do."  Reacting swiftly to the oversight, Mr. Obama promptly summoned his staff once again, emphasizing the importance of his previous request. "It seems I must clarify myself," he emphasized. "Such information is precisely what I should have been included in. Even Biden understood that. Could one of you kindly forward it to me, please?" As of the time of this report, the President had yet to receive the email.”XÓ  Justice Antonin Scalia caused a stir at the typically serene Supreme Court today, abruptly storming out of his office to express his vehement disapproval. "I'm never going to another damn N.B.A. game as long as I live!" he exclaimed. While the exact cause of Justice Scalia's outburst remained unclear, one of his clerks disclosed that he had witnessed something on ESPN that deeply upset the esteemed Justice. Prompted by the commotion, the other Justices emerged from their chambers to witness a visibly rattled Justice Scalia, his face flushed and his body trembling with fury. "I've attended basketball games my entire life," he roared. "I always believed they were a safe haven. Well, it seems I was mistaken. It appears I've been wrong about many things, haven't I? Haven't I?" In an attempt to console him, Justice Clarence Thomas silently approached, only to be met with a vehement rejection. "Get away from me, Clarence!" Scalia screamed. "I can't trust anyone anymore."”X¢   In the final stretch of the campaign, Mitt Romney is said to be undergoing a transformation, as his aides claim that jealousy is consuming him over President Obama's burgeoning bond with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Despite publicly expressing his indifference to Christie's helicopter ride with the President, Romney has privately confided to his advisors about his inner turmoil, confessing, "Seeing him with Chris Christie is tearing me apart." This internal struggle began earlier this week when Romney watched Christie on CNN mentioning that President Obama had given him his contact number at the White House. According to a Romney aide, the former Massachusetts governor responded dismissively, saying, "Fine, whatever, do we have to watch this?" before abruptly leaving the room, leaving behind an uncomfortable atmosphere.  Compounding Romney's distress is the fact that Christie has been unresponsive to his attempts at communication. The aide revealed, "Mitt was trying to explain his position on FEMA to reporters yesterday, and he got all excited because his phone started vibrating." Unfortunately for Romney, the call turned out to be from his wife, Ann, instead of the desired response from Christie. Recent reports have observed Romney absentmindedly doodling Christie's name in the margins of his briefing books, indicating his preoccupation with the New Jersey governor. In a bid to incite jealousy in Christie, Romney has taken to reaching out to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, according to the aide. However, Cuomo has also neglected to respond to Romney's attempts at contact, leaving the Republican nominee feeling despondent and alone.  The emergence of this new Romney, consumed by envy and seeking to provoke feelings of longing in others, is a stark departure from his previous demeanor. As the campaign nears its end, it remains to be seen how this internal struggle will affect Romney's final push for the presidency.”XÍ  Prepare yourself for a narrative that will genuinely stir your emotions. In the face of kidney failure resulting from her type 2 diabetes, 11-year-old Julie Mandelo suddenly found herself engaged in a life-or-death battle. Without a prompt transplant, her chances of survival were alarmingly low. However, a remarkable turn of events unfolded: an anonymous individual, with no prior connection to Julie or her family, stumbled upon an abandoned field and began an extraordinary search, ultimately unearthing a kidney. Astonishing! Could there be a more fitting depiction of a real-life guardian angel? The stranger's awareness of the fifth-grader's desperate need for a kidney transplant remains unclear, yet his intervention proved fortuitous. Venturing into a field off I-80 near Lincoln, NE, he diligently combed through the area for a suitable match. For a full 45 minutes, this good Samaritan scrutinized rocks and explored shrubbery until he finally detected the scent of a kidney resting in the soil alongside a cluster of wheat stalks. Demonstrating remarkable dedication, he even took the time to rinse it in a nearby stream! All this for an unfamiliar individual about whom he knew nothing, aside from her dire need for assistance. Truly inspiring! Naturally, he remained far too modest to accept any recognition for his noble act. After embarking on a 500-mile journey to deliver Julie's new kidney to her hospital in Chicago, he promptly departed before she even had the opportunity to express her gratitude. This exemplifies the true essence of a humble hero who, upon hearing of a stranger's need for a kidney, did not hesitate to immediately commence his quest in the dirt. Inspirational! Faith in humanity is hereby restored.”Xq  In a move driven by concerns over security, House Speaker John Boehner announced on Wednesday that he would confine all his drinking to the walls of his office for the foreseeable future. Acknowledging the potential need to extend his work hours to accommodate this adjustment, Boehner justified his decision, emphasizing, "I am doing this for the American people. They deserve an assurance that their Speaker remains secure." Classifying this measure as a temporary precaution, the Ohio Republican was adamant that his resolution to consume alcohol exclusively within the confines of his workspace should not be misconstrued as a critique on the proficiency of the nation's bartenders, whom he praised for their exceptional craftsmanship. To those individuals expertly positioned behind the bar, Boehner, his voice quivering with emotion, expressed, "I assure you, I will return."”Xs   Critics of President Obama are pressuring him to adopt a more assertive approach in response to the crises in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine, arguing that his cautious foreign policy strategy lacks coherence. Leading the charge, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) criticized Obama for his failure to take swift and reckless action. They contend that the President's insistence on thoughtful consideration goes against the core principles of American foreign policy.  Expressing their frustration, McCain and Graham called on Obama to act hastily and without restraint. They argued that the urgency of the situation demands an immediate and impulsive response. McCain stated, "The President's decision to waste valuable time pondering these events is a departure from the most fundamental principles of American foreign policy."  Graham echoed this sentiment, lamenting that the American people are growing impatient with Obama's refusal to engage in imprudent actions. He emphasized the need for the President to do something rash, as the situation in these regions requires a bold and thoughtless approach.  McCain, in his most scathing criticism, accused Obama of exhibiting a failure of leadership by stubbornly refusing to engage in reckless behavior. He asserted that if he were President, he would have already taken numerous ill-advised actions. "If I held the highest office in the land, you can be certain that I would have made plenty of foolish decisions by now," McCain asserted.  These criticisms reflect a growing sentiment among some political figures who believe that a more reckless and impulsive approach is necessary in addressing the complex challenges facing the United States on the international stage. They argue that caution and thoughtful deliberation, which have been hallmarks of Obama's foreign policy, are insufficient in addressing the urgent crises at hand.”Xy  In a scathing critique of the economic strategies implemented by the current Administration, the chairman of the Republican National Committee has accused President Obama of coercing a staggering five million Americans into joining the workforce since his inauguration in 2009. Speaking on Sunday's episode of Meet the Press, Reince Priebus lamented, "When President Obama assumed office, there were five million Americans who spent their days at home, but alas, they are no longer in that position. Regrettably, they now find themselves compelled to work five days a week, and their frustration knows no bounds."  Priebus asserted that the Republican Party's contenders in the upcoming midterm elections would seize on what he deemed to be the President's most glaring vulnerability, which he referred to as the unsightly facet of employment. "To uproot five million Americans from their domestic lives and require them to abandon their abodes for a full eight hours per day is an affront to the principles of democracy," Priebus declared. "This is not a dictatorship; this is the United States of America."  Furthermore, Priebus contended that the President's shortcomings in this area have bolstered the Republican Party's ability to communicate effectively with voters. "If you are weary and exasperated by the notion of gainful employment, then we implore you to cast your vote for us," he urged.”XA  In the ongoing discussion surrounding Syria, a prominent Senate Republican asserted today that the most effective solution to the crisis in the war-ravaged Middle Eastern nation is to defund Obamacare immediately. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), appearing on the Fox News Channel, shared his viewpoint with host Sean Hannity. He stated, "If we are aiming to send a resolute message to Bashar al-Assad, I cannot think of a more effective method than defunding Obamacare." Expanding on his strategy, Senator Cruz continued, "By defunding Obamacare, we would essentially be conveying to Assad that this is how we challenge our own President, so just imagine what we would do to you. This would make him reconsider before engaging in any further provocative actions." Senator Cruz expressed his belief that firing Tomahawk missiles would not have the same impact on Syria as defunding Obamacare. "You can launch as many Tomahawk missiles as you want," he stated. "But they will not yield the same consequences for Syria as defunding Obamacare."  Shortly after Senator Cruz's appearance, his statements were strongly criticized by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona. Senator McCain referred to the prospect of bombing Syria as the sole reason for his continued existence. "Look, I have been in a very desolate state since the 2008 election," Senator McCain told reporters. "There have been numerous mornings when, to be quite honest, I have lacked motivation to get out of bed. It is easy for individuals like Ted Cruz to condemn Tomahawk missiles, but the act of striking Syria is what keeps me going."”X±  In a heartwarming display of unity amidst conflict, Christmas brought together American troops and ISIS fighters in the disputed Syrian city of Raqqa. As the sun set on Christmas Eve, members of the American-led coalition against the Islamic State stationed on the streets were taken aback by the resonant voices of ISIS fighters, walking towards them with arms interlocked and no weapons in sight, singing Silent Night. The insurgents' outpouring of Christmas joy was so moving that American troops, defying orders from the Pentagon and their commanding officers, joined in the chorus. They left their posts and mingled with their former adversaries around a pine tree, which a jihadist had cut down and adorned with makeshift decorations.  This scene repeated itself across ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq. Late into the night and into the morning, tears of joy glistened in the eyes of fighters as they sang, socialized, and even engaged in games of pickup soccer with the very individuals they would have executed only hours before. For one day, the two sides embraced each other, exchanged modest gifts of food and cigarettes, and prayed together, solemnly commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ.  This remarkable event serves as a reminder that even in the darkest corners of the world, where hope appears lost and the interminable war traps unfortunate individuals, the spirit of Christmas shines through. It is a testament to the power of this holiday, which brings out the inherent goodness in people, even in the bleakest of circumstances. So, this Christmas, let us extend our well wishes to America, to ISIS, and to every family, regardless of the side they find themselves on. Merry Christmas!”X?  Colonel Muammar Qaddafi, the former dictator of Libya, has ended the speculation surrounding his whereabouts by surprising many with his announcement to run for the Republican Presidential nomination. This unexpected declaration was made during a town-hall meeting in Concord, New Hampshire. Joining a Republican field rumored to consist of over seven hundred candidates, Qaddafi's appearance at the Concord town hall left some New Hampshire Republicans astonished. The Libyan strongman's aide, however, stated that his transformation into a G.O.P. candidate was logical considering his increasing detachment from reality in his final days in Tripoli. Qaddafi, recognizable in his trademark yellow turban and robe, received mixed reviews during his first campaign appearance. Some citizens of New Hampshire criticized his excessively long six-hour stump speech and called for it to be trimmed. Others suggested toning down his rhetoric, particularly his closing statement about fighting for the Republican nomination until the last drop of blood. Despite these critiques, Qaddafi was praised by some for his extensive knowledge of history and geography, surpassing that of Michele Bachmann. Nonetheless, Qaddafi faces significant challenges in his pursuit of the G.O.P. nomination, as current polls place him towards the back of the pack, ahead of former Senator Rick Santorum but trailing behind a candidate known as the "pizza guy." One pollster remarked that Qaddafi's potential downfall may be his perceived moderation, which puts him out of sync with the current group of Republican contenders.”X™  In a series of unfortunate events, Mitt Romney finds himself embroiled in yet another gaffe, further jeopardizing his aspirations of portraying himself as a skillful statesman. The incident unfolded during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where Romney presented him with gifts that resulted in an unexpected turn of events. A HoneyBaked ham and a wheel of cheddar cheese were offered as tokens of goodwill, but to Romney's dismay, Netanyahu promptly ordered their removal and destruction from his residence.  Undeterred by this initial setback, Romney proceeded to address the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. However, his speech took an unexpected turn when he extended his congratulations to the Jewish people for their alleged role in building the pyramids. To the astonishment of the legislators, Romney recounted his personal encounter with these magnificent structures during a Middle East cruise with his wife, Ann. While acknowledging that pyramid construction might not be as momentous as saving the Olympics, he urged the Jewish people to bask in their accomplishment, stating, "Nice job. Sensing that his remarks were not well-received, Romney attempted to salvage the situation by insisting, "No, really. Incredible building job you did. If any of you would like to work on our house in La Jolla, just say the word. Only thing is, you'll have to work Saturdays."  The day concluded on an awkward note for Mr. Romney as he encountered further difficulties during a visit to the West Bank. His ill-fated attempt to deposit ten million dollars left him in an uncomfortable situation, adding to the string of missteps that have come to define his campaign.”X   San Diego Convention Center to Host Inaugural Gathering of Those Who Eliminated Osama bin Laden  SAN DIEGO - The San Diego Convention Center is set to welcome an unprecedented convention of individuals responsible for taking down the notorious terrorist mastermind, Osama bin Laden. With an expected attendance of between three thousand and four thousand, organizers are eagerly anticipating the debut event. The primary objective of this convention, according to organizers, is to assist those who eliminated bin Laden in effectively marketing their experiences for various media platforms, including books, movies, YouTube videos, and more.  Tracy Klugian, the mastermind behind the convention, conceived the idea shortly after his own successful mission in 2011. Klugian expressed his hopes that this weekend-long gathering would propel participants to elevate their narratives surrounding the elimination of Osama bin Laden. "Ultimately, this convention is centered around the art of storytelling," Klugian stated. "I've encountered countless individuals with incredible tales about their encounters with bin Laden. However, many of them require a few workshops to transform their stories into captivating TED talks."  Klugian dismissed any notions that the market had become oversaturated with accounts from those who took down the Al Qaeda leader, suggesting that this would hinder efforts to monetize that fateful night in Abbottabad. "That's akin to suggesting there can only be one Hunger Games movie," he scoffed. "Trust me, the act of eliminating bin Laden carries immense brand power."  The convention is set to commence in the coming weeks, and anticipation is running high within the community of those who played pivotal roles in bringing down one of the world's most notorious terrorists.”Xó  Head of National Security Agency Vows to Avoid Detection in Spying Scandal  In the wake of the recent controversy surrounding the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance of European allies, General Keith Alexander, the head of the agency, pledged today that they would take all necessary measures to prevent future detection. General Alexander emphasized the two main responsibilities of any spy agency: conducting surveillance and evading discovery. Regrettably, he acknowledged that the NSA had excelled in the former while neglecting the latter, resulting in a breach of trust with some of its closest allies.  General Alexander outlined the agency's plans to implement stringent new protocols, amounting to a zero-tolerance policy for getting caught. He convened a meeting with his top officials, urging them to channel the same level of dedication they applied to spying on Germany, France, and Spain into safeguarding the agency's covert activities from detection. He underscored the imperative for nothing less than complete success, asserting that any failure to prevent exposure would be deemed unacceptable.  Furthermore, General Alexander extended a sincere apology to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, one of the primary targets of the agency's eavesdropping. Recognizing the distress caused by the revelation that her closest ally had monitored her phone conversations for over a decade, he assured her that such knowledge would remain hidden in the future.  The NSA's commitment to avoiding detection represents a distinct shift in strategy for the agency. As it grapples with the fallout from the spying scandal, the implementation of these new practices aims to rebuild trust with European allies and prevent similar controversies from arising in the future.”X(	  Americans Express Concern as Climate Change Impacts Home Landscapes  A recent poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Opinion Research Institute reveals a notable shift in Americans' attitudes towards climate change. While many were previously unconcerned about the global issue, the poll shows that citizens are now becoming worried as the effects of global warming begin to impact the appearance of their lawns. This newfound concern has left residents across California particularly angry and outraged.  Despite witnessing rising sea levels, habitat destruction, and catastrophic weather events like hurricanes and tsunamis, Americans have largely remained indifferent to the urgency of climate change. However, as their lawns suffer from unsightly barrenness, citizens are finally waking up to the crisis. The University of Minnesota's poll emphasizes the disconcerting fact that the loss of decorative plantings, shrubs, and ground cover options has become more alarming to Americans than the broader consequences of climate change.  In interviews conducted throughout California, residents expressed their frustration and outrage at the worsening impact of climate change on their lawns. Harland Dorrinson, a resident of suburban Sacramento, lamented, "We are being forced to create a front lawn out of stones and, yes, cacti. I'm not sure I want to leave this world to my children." Tracy Klugian from San Diego echoed this sentiment, stating, "Right now we're looking at a situation where we have to choose between saving our climbing hydrangeas or our roses. We are no longer living like humans."  Carol Foyler, a San Mateo resident, witnessed her once-gorgeous green lawn turn into a hideous brown during California's drought. Foyler placed blame on scientists, accusing them of failing to adequately warn the public about the true cost of climate change. "They always said that polar bears would starve to death," she said, "but they never told us our lawns would look like crap."  This poll highlights a significant shift in public perception, as Americans are beginning to connect the dots between climate change and their own daily lives. The concern for the appearance of lawns, once seen as a trivial matter, now serves as a wake-up call for many, prompting a reevaluation of the urgency needed to combat climate change.”X{  In a recent announcement, the National Alliance of Funeral Directors expressed their agreement with Republican Supreme Court Justices who argue that the Affordable Care Act, a cornerstone of the Obama Administration, is unconstitutional. The Alliance, echoing the sentiments of Revolutionary War hero Patrick Henry, believes that the Constitution guarantees every American the liberty to be deceased.  The organization vows to fight relentlessly for individuals' right to be deceased. They draw attention to the Second Amendment, which protects Americans' right to shoot one another, without any mention of providing health insurance to prevent death. This constitutional right to inflict harm on others and cause death is currently upheld in all fifty states, most recently in Florida.  Justice Samuel Alito, in his remarks on the Affordable Care Act, likened it to burial insurance. Interestingly, burial insurance aligns with the Republican health-care plan, which the Alliance wholeheartedly supports. Under this plan, individuals would be obligated to purchase a coffin from one of the Alliance's member-owned and -operated funeral homes. They highly recommend the luxurious Peaceful Valley Royale coffin, complete with a sienna satin interior and exquisite imitation antique nickel handles, priced at $2,899.  As the leading organization representing funeral directors, gravediggers, embalmers, and cremators across America, the Alliance is confident that the Supreme Court will ultimately recognize the constitutional right to pursue death and reject health care. When this decision is made, the Alliance will be ready to provide their services to all.”X  Majority of Oregonians Support Building Border Wall to Prevent Influx of Angry White Men, Poll Finds  A recent poll released on Monday indicates that a majority of Oregon residents are in favor of constructing a twenty-foot wall along their state's border to keep out irate male Caucasians. According to the survey results, Oregonians have grown weary of these individuals entering their state and bringing with them guns, violence, and acts of terrorism that have tarnished the once idyllic region.  State Senator Carol Foyler, an advocate for the wall, expressed her concerns about the changes that have occurred since the arrival of these angry white men. "This used to be such a nice state," she lamented. "But parts of it are now unrecognizable."  Despite the growing support for the Oregon wall, critics argue that the proposal fails to address the existing population of angry white men already residing in the state. These opponents believe that a more effective solution would involve forcibly deporting these individuals and resettling them elsewhere, potentially in Texas.  While some critics acknowledge that such deportations might separate these individuals from their families, others argue that their loved ones would be accepting of their departure. The debate surrounding this issue remains contentious, with proponents of deportation emphasizing the need to restore peace and safety in the state.  In an unrelated matter, Marc Philippe Eskenazi was captured on video at Rockefeller Center, charming passersby with his melodic holiday tunes.”Xþ   Bond fans, get ready to be shaken and stirred! Sony Pictures is already building anticipation for the film that follows Spectre, and they've just made a casting announcement that is going to leave you shaken, not stirred. Hold on to your martinis, because Channing Tatum is set to bring the iconic American poet, Walt Whitman, to life on the big screen.  In a statement released this morning, Sony Pictures revealed that Tatum has been cast as the 19th-century literary figure, and it's safe to say that this role couldn't be in better hands. Tatum himself confirmed the news on Twitter, expressing his excitement with a simple, yet powerful, "Yes. Just yes."  Tatum has been on a career ascent lately, and stepping into the shoes of the father of free verse is the perfect opportunity for him to showcase his talent in a big-budget franchise. His agent revealed that Tatum has been immersing himself in the world of Bond by watching every film in the series and diving deep into Whitman's poetry, particularly his masterpiece, Leaves Of Grass. To truly embody the character, Tatum has also been working closely with a dialect coach to master the accent, and he has undergone a physical transformation, gaining an impressive 65 pounds and growing out Whitman's iconic shaggy beard.  Not only are fans eagerly awaiting Tatum's portrayal of Whitman, but his future co-star, Daniel Craig, is equally thrilled about the casting. In a statement, Craig expressed his admiration for Tatum, stating, "I've always been a big Channing fan, and it's an honor to have him join the Bond family. I, for one, think he's going to be an incredible Walt."  While we still have a month to go until Spectre hits theaters worldwide on November 6, the announcement of Tatum's involvement has already sparked excitement for the film that will follow. Stay tuned for exclusive photos of Tatum on set in England, where he will be almost unrecognizable as the late literary pioneer. Bond fans, get ready for a thrilling ride with Channing Tatum as Walt Whitman in Bond 25!”X  Vice President Joe Biden expressed his eagerness today to deliver a riveting speech at the upcoming 2012 Democratic Convention, yet he remains in the dark about the event's location. With a whimsical touch of humor, Mr. Biden admitted that resorting to a Google search crossed his mind, but alas, his internet connection has been on the fritz for several weeks, leaving him in a state of technological disarray. The Vice President remains hopeful that he will soon be informed of the convention's whereabouts, but in the meantime, he is diligently crafting his speech, assuring that it will leave a lasting impact on the attendees. Reflecting on Clint Eastwood's unorthodox performance at the Republican Convention, Mr. Biden acknowledged that he initially planned to rely on a pre-written script. However, the renowned actor's unconventional act has compelled the Vice President to raise the bar and view this event as an opportunity to showcase his exceptional improvisation skills, adding an unexpected element of excitement to his address.”•t     Xž   Americans Long for Republican Candidate Indifferent to Their Fate, Survey Finds  In a striking indication of shifting voter perspectives on Presidential hopefuls, a recent survey has unveiled a deep sense of nostalgia among Americans for a Republican candidate who had expressed little concern for the well-being of nearly half of the country's population. Through interviews conducted nationwide, voters have voiced a sense of longing and wistfulness for a man who appeared indifferent to the fate of a significant portion of the nation's residents.  "When he was running, it seemed like a negative trait that he didn't care whether forty-seven per cent of the country lived or died," confessed Tracy Klugian from Akron, Ohio. "Now I realize we were perhaps too discerning." Kent Bantwell from Springfield, Missouri added, "He may have caused thousands of people to lose their livelihoods and face homelessness, but at least he didn't expel them from the country. I must admit, I miss him."  While Harland Dorrinson from Jupiter, Florida expressed his desire for the man to enter the 2016 race, he admitted that such a scenario was unlikely. "That secret tape where he admitted to screwing over forty-seven per cent of the country would undoubtedly resurface," Dorrinson lamented. "The fact that he wasn't harming an even larger portion of the population would haunt him now."  Carol Foyler from San Dimas, California shared her regret for the harsh criticism she had directed towards the man during his 2012 Presidential campaign. "I called him every name in the book â€“ a jerk, a tool, a sociopath, and worse," Foyler recalled, shaking her head. "Now, in hindsight, he appears almost saintly."  As the nation yearns for a candidate with similar indifference towards a significant portion of Americans, the sentiment is clear: a Republican candidate who lacks concern for the well-being of a substantial segment of the population is deeply missed.”XI  In a disconcerting development for the 114th Congress, a recent poll released on Tuesday indicates that the newly-formed legislative body is already the most reviled in the nation's history. The University of Minnesota's Opinion Research Institute conducted the poll, revealing that a mere eight percent of respondents voiced their approval of Congress's performance, a scathing condemnation of the lawmakers' initial foray into their duties. To begin with, the 114th Congress received a slightly more favorable ten percent approval rating. However, after the House of Representatives reelected John Boehner (R.-Ohio) as Speaker, that number plummeted to eight percent. On the Senate side, Joni Ernst (R.-Iowa), a fresh face in the most abhorred Congress in American history, dismissed the low approval rating as inconsequential. Ernst argued that if individuals were asked to pick a number between one and ten, eight would be considered relatively high. "So it's all good," she asserted. Astonishingly, Congress's approval rating dipped to a meager four percent following Senator Ernst's comment.”X  House Republicans Vote to Shut Down Prefrontal Cortex, Escalating Stalemate in Washington  WASHINGTON - In a bold move that deepens the political deadlock gripping the nation's capital, House Republicans voted today to effectively shut down the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for reasoning and impulses. The resolution, which received significant support from the Tea Party faction, calls for a partial shutdown of the brain, leaving the medulla and cerebellum, commonly referred to as the reptilian brain, intact and functioning.  The passage of the bill was met with cheers from the Tea Party caucus, with Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, the sponsor of the measure, hailing it as long overdue. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, did not provide a specific timeline for reopening the prefrontal cortex, stating that it would most certainly remain closed during any negotiations with President Obama. "That's the only leverage we have," he told reporters. Representative Bachmann echoed Boehner's sentiment, stating, "The President can go ahead and put a gun to our heads. There's nothing there."  While the decision to shut down the prefrontal cortex rattled Wall Street, neuroscientist Davis Logsdon argued that it should be viewed as little more than a symbolic vote. Logsdon noted that the prefrontal cortex has effectively been dormant since the 2008 election, rendering this move largely redundant.  The vote underscores the deepening divide between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, with both sides digging in their heels and refusing to budge on key issues. The shutdown of the prefrontal cortex, a critical component of cognitive function, is seen as a drastic measure that further hampers the ability of lawmakers to find common ground and pass legislation.  As the stalemate in Washington continues, the nation anxiously awaits a resolution to the impasse. With the prefrontal cortex effectively shut down, the prospects for productive negotiations and bipartisan compromise appear increasingly bleak.”X-   Coca-Cola Sparks Controversy with Super Bowl Ad Suggesting the Existence of Other Languages  The Coca-Cola Company found itself at the center of a firestorm on Sunday when its Super Bowl ad made a seemingly inflammatory claim: that languages besides English actually exist. The controversial commercial, which quickly drew outrage and horror from viewers across the country, has been dubbed by many as the most incendiary Super Bowl ad in history.  One such viewer, Carol Foyler, a mother of three from Akron, Ohio, expressed her shock and dismay at the ad's message. "I was enjoying the Super Bowl with my family, and suddenly, out of nowhere, comes this ad suggesting that there are other languages that aren't English," she recounted. "I grabbed the remote and turned it off. My kids shouldn't be exposed to garbage that's just going to confuse them."  The Alliance for Responsible Advertising, a conservative watchdog group known for monitoring ads it deems offensive and unsuitable for family viewing, wasted no time in condemning Coke's ad. In a strongly-worded statement, the group demanded an apology from the company and insisted that the ad never be aired again. "Last night, Coke assaulted millions of Americans with its misguided and inappropriate view that other languages exist," the statement read. "In the future, we strongly hope that Coke will keep its crazy theories to itself."  The controversy surrounding the ad has sparked a broader conversation about the place of diversity and multiculturalism in American society. While some argue that the ad was a harmless celebration of cultural diversity, others see it as a threat to the primacy of the English language. As tensions rise, it remains to be seen how Coca-Cola will respond to the backlash and whether it will affect the company's reputation in the long term.”X›  Months-long and nationwide, an exhaustive manhunt concluded in a remarkable fashion today with the discovery of an individual in Wisconsin who, regrettably, lacks the charismatic appeal of Mitt Romney. As the U.S.S. Wisconsin set the stage, representatives from the esteemed Guinness Book of World Records were present to officially verify the outcome of this quest. Indeed, this man has been determined to be the least interesting person in the United States, as confirmed by a Guinness official, who further noted that Mr. Romney had held this title since 1947.  Following their joint appearance, during which cautionary advice was issued against operating heavy machinery, Mr. Romney and the newfound individual shared their thoughts. Seizing the spotlight, the center of attention utilized his brief remarks to outline his vision for America, asserting that substantial savings could be achieved by abolishing the necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. On the other hand, Mr. Romney echoed a theme that will resonate throughout the upcoming autumn campaign, emphasizing the need to transform America, with both individuals proudly identifying themselves as Transformers.”X¯  In a stunning turn of events, the House select committee abruptly canceled its highly anticipated Benghazi hearings on Tuesday morning. The decision came just moments after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shocked the nation by announcing her withdrawal from the Presidential race. The chaos unfolded rapidly, with Secretary Clinton making her announcement at 9:00 A.M. swiftly followed by the committee chairman, Trey Gowdy, canceling the hearings at 9:04 A.M.  Gowdy addressed the media, explaining the committee's sudden change of plans. "As you know, we have been diligently preparing for this week's hearings for months," he said. "However, after a brief meeting with my fellow committee members over the past four minutes, we have unanimously concluded that we possess all the necessary information regarding Benghazi." Gowdy firmly denied any connection between the cancellation and Clinton's unexpected departure from the race. "We genuinely wish her well in her future endeavors," he added.  Nevertheless, the situation took yet another twist when Clinton swiftly called an impromptu press conference at 9:13 A.M. to announce her reentry into the presidential race. "I was simply trying to make a point," Clinton explained to reporters before embarking on campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire.  The aftermath of Clinton's second announcement was far from calm. An irate Gowdy, responding to her decision to reenter the race, deemed it highly unethical and promptly revealed that the committee's investigators had just uncovered new evidence pertaining to Benghazi. The revelation only added to the confusion and turmoil that gripped Washington in the wake of these unexpected developments.”XÆ   Prepare yourself for a heartwarming tale that is sure to brighten your day. In a significant development, the American Medical Association (AMA) has officially renamed autism as boys autism, paying tribute to a young boy who had previously battled with the condition. This remarkable gesture serves as a beautiful homage to his memory. "We felt it was important to ensure that the boy who once grappled with what was known as autism would always be remembered. Therefore, we have decided to change the name of the condition to boys autism," stated Dr. Steven J. Stack, the esteemed president of the AMA. This tribute is believed to be a fitting memorial to the boy's enduring legacy. Dr. Stack further emphasized the AMA's unwavering commitment to unraveling the enigmatic aspects of boys autism. This astonishing tribute to the boy is truly extraordinary. Having been diagnosed with the condition many years ago, he lived his entire life with boys autism. Despite the numerous challenges he faced due to his condition, the boy never lost hope and dedicated himself to leading a fulfilling and meaningful existence. It is his unyielding determination and resilience in the face of adversity that prompted the AMA to bestow this honor upon him. "This is an unequivocal milestone in the history of boys autism," proclaimed Joanna Whisenhunt, chairwoman of the National Boys Autism Foundation, an organization dedicated to comprehending the origins and repercussions of boys autism. Shockingly, one in every 68 children is diagnosed with boys autism. Now, whenever boys autism is discussed, we can fondly remember the boy who battled boys autism and draw inspiration from his unwavering spirit. It is highly likely that you know someone affected by boys autism, a condition that impacts millions of individuals in the United States alone. On this momentous day for boys autism, we encourage you to express your gratitude to the AMA in the comment section, as their actions deserve recognition.”e(X%	  Ferguson Protesters Descend on St. Louis After Fatal Shooting Involving Off-Duty Cop  ST. LOUIS â€” The city of St. Louis found itself once again at the center of unrest last evening, following a fatal shooting in the Shaw Neighborhood. The incident, which occurred around 7:30 p.m., involved an off-duty St. Louis City police officer who was patrolling for a private security company in the area.  According to reports, the officer noticed three men as he was driving by the intersection of Klemm and Shaw. The men began to run, prompting the officer to give chase. Eventually, the officer got out of his car and followed one of the suspects through a gangway. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson stated that the three suspects regrouped, with one of them approaching the officer in an aggressive manner. Despite the officer's commands to stop, the suspect refused, leading to a physical altercation. The suspect then attempted to flee, firing three shots at the officer before the officer returned fire. The suspect's gun malfunctioned and jammed, allowing the officer to fire a total of 17 shots. The suspect, identified as an 18-year-old African American male, was pronounced dead at the scene. Police later recovered a 9 millimeter gun believed to belong to the suspect.  Notably, this incident has attracted the attention of Ferguson protesters, who swiftly descended upon the Shaw Neighborhood. Overnight, the area experienced unrest, with reports of vandalism and attacks on police cars. Many of the protesters present were individuals who had previously participated in demonstrations in Ferguson, as well as at Busch Stadium during Cardinals playoff games and downtown.  The Shaw Neighborhood, known for its beautifully restored Victorian-era architecture, was not the only area affected by the protests. Demonstrations spilled onto Grand Avenue, prompting the closure of portions of the street near Saint Louis University Hospital and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital.  Relatives of the deceased suspect have disputed the police account, claiming that he was unarmed. However, this contradicts both the aforementioned account and the statement made by Police Chief Dotson.  As St. Louis grapples with yet another incident involving police and protests, residents are left to wonder when this cycle of unrest will come to an end.”X
  Vote Rigging is Real and Practically Undetectable  In yet another instance of Donald Trump drawing attention to critical issues, the spotlight is now on the ability to elect the next president of the United States fairly and with integrity. At the heart of this concern lies an electronic voting system known as the GEMS election management system, which is currently utilized by around 25 percent of the country.  Unfortunately, the GEMS system has a built-in capability for committing election fraud through vote manipulation. One of the primary methods employed in this fraud is through a fractional vote feature. This feature is embedded in each GEMS application, allowing for the alteration of votes by pre-setting vote percentages to predetermined levels, completely disregarding the actual votes cast. The most troubling aspect is that this process is invisible and impossible to detect for poll watchers and those without computer expertise.  According to the reputable site Black Box Voting, the use of the decimalized vote feature is highly unlikely to be detected through auditing or canvass procedures. Moreover, this manipulation can be applied swiftly across large jurisdictions in less than a minute. Some well-known entities involved in GEMS fraud-enabled machines include Global Election Systems, Diebold Election Systems, Premier Election Systems, Dominion Voting Systems, and Election Systems Software. Additionally, there are several private regional subcontractors implicated in this issue.  At the time of their report, these compromised machines were being used in various states such as Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah, and Vermont, as well as multiple counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. It is also worth noting that the GEMS system is employed in Canada.  Another concerning aspect is the ability to manipulate overall percentages. For instance, one candidate can be assigned 45% of the votes, another 35%, and the remaining 10% allocated to a third candidate. These predetermined percentages will be reported as the final results, irrespective of the actual votes cast. To further complicate matters, fractions are not visible in the final reports by default, with decimals reported as whole numbers. Furthermore, any evidence of tampering or the existence of fractional values can be instantly erased from the underlying database using a specific setting in the GEMS data tables.  Black Box Voting emphasizes that the instructions to treat votes as decimal values instead of whole numbers are repeated multiple times within the GEMS source code, ruling out the possibility of accidental creation”X^  Judge Napolitano Offers Insight on Replacing Hillary Clinton on the Democratic Ticket  In the wake of Hillary Clinton's recent health episode at the September 11 memorial, speculation about the possibility of her replacement on the Democratic ticket has been rampant. Opinions on the matter vary, with some suggesting that she can indeed be replaced, while others argue that she must first resign. Confusion surrounding this issue has left many scratching their heads, prompting some to turn to George Orwell's works for clarity. During a recent appearance on Fox and Friends, Andrew Napolitano, a libertarian judge and lawyer, provided a comprehensive explanation of the options available to the Democrats and the potential pitfalls they could encounter.  While some media outlets claim that the Democrats have already selected a replacement candidate, others continue to defend the notion that Clinton's illness is nothing more than a case of pneumonia from which she will soon recover. However, it is rather presumptuous to assume that the American people are incapable of discerning the truth or that we share common experiences with the elite. Recovering from pneumonia takes time and cannot be rushed.  The reality of the situation remains uncertain as those with the knowledge refuse to disclose it. This lack of transparency has led to a widening credibility gap that is causing frustration among patriots. Regardless of the outcome, we can expect an eventful few weeks ahead, accompanied by a lesson in history. It is worth noting that even I, as a writer, am aware of the Eagleton incident, despite him being my senator.”X  Missing Baby's Body Found in Dumpster, Suspect Still at Large  Long Beach police announced on Sunday, through a statement posted on the department's Facebook page, that the suspect responsible for the heinous crimes in question remains outstanding. Eliza's mother and uncle, unfortunately, remain in critical condition, while her father has been discharged from the hospital. Eliza, a first-born child, was the apple of her father's eye. Upon his arrival home, he chose not to make any statements.  Long Beach Police Lieutenant Lloyd Cox expressed that the family is living in fear of potential retribution if they were to disclose any information about the incident. Cox stated, "They're afraid of a person coming back again, if they talk, and that they could be the victim of any retaliation." The family's apprehension is evident, and they are living in terror. The motive behind this heinous act is not believed to be random, leading investigators to speculate that the abductor may have been acquainted with the family. The perpetrator has been described as a dark-skinned Hispanic or African American man, providing law enforcement with little to no leads.  The investigation into this heart-wrenching case continues as authorities work tirelessly to bring justice for Eliza and her family.”Xm   Allen West Criticizes Obama's Foreign Policy and Clinton's Campaign Tactics  In a recent interview with an RT anchor, Allen West, the executive director of a policy center, expressed his concerns about the Obama administration's foreign policy and Hillary Clinton's campaign tactics. West argued that both the Obama regime and the Clinton campaign have failed to properly formulate and execute their policies.  The anchor questioned whether the focus on projecting a policy deflects from the more important issue of formulating effective policies. West agreed, emphasizing the importance of policy and the need to portray courage, resolve, resiliency, and strength in foreign relations. He criticized Clinton's "reset button" gimmick with Russia, arguing that foreign policy should not rely on empty rhetoric and sound bites.  West also criticized Obama's statement that Assad must go, calling it one of the dumbest statements ever. He argued that such tough rhetoric without backing it up undermines credibility. West expressed his concern that Clinton would continue these policies, which he believes have diminished the United States' standing in the world.  West's criticism aligns with a broader concern about the consequences of decades of nation-building and a perceived disregard for the country's military forces. He argued that another four years of reckless policies and diminishing the United States' power under Clinton would be detrimental.  In conclusion, West's remarks highlight his disagreement with the Obama administration's foreign policy and his concerns about Clinton's campaign tactics. He emphasized the importance of formulating thoughtful and pragmatic policies, rather than relying on gimmicks and empty rhetoric. West's views resonate with a growing sentiment that the United States needs a change in leadership to restore its credibility and strength on the global stage.”X   Berkeley Petition Fails to Halt Controversial Speaker Bill Maher  In spite of widespread opposition, Bill Maher, known for his controversial remarks, delivered a commencement speech at the University of California, Berkeley on December 20. A petition signed by approximately 6,000 individuals who objected to Maher's comments about Islam had called for the rescission of his invitation. However, Chancellor Nicholas Dirks stood firm, asserting that free speech is a fundamental right, both constitutionally protected and deeply ingrained in Berkeley's identity.  Protestors gathered to express their discontent with Maher's presence at the ceremony, holding signs both inside and outside the venue. Their grievances stemmed from Maher's assertion that Islam behaves like the Mafia, resorting to violence when faced with criticism. They were also troubled by his remarks during a televised argument with Ben Affleck.  During his 15-minute speech, Maher touched on various topics that he believed graduates should remember. He emphasized the significance of the First Amendment, reminding the audience that they were fortunate to live in a country that upholds such freedoms. Maher commended the University for choosing him as the speaker on the anniversary of the Free Speech Movement. As he concluded his address, he urged UC Berkeley students to embrace free thinking, stating, "Though I may not agree with everything the man says, I believe all Americans should remember: the last thing I'll suggest to you is to be a free thinker. One reason our politics are so chaotic is because tribalism has taken over."  Despite the controversy surrounding his appearance, Maher's speech proceeded as planned, leaving many attendees with conflicting emotions regarding both his message and his presence at the ceremony.”XÛ	  "Freed Slaves in Washington? Don't Blame Us, We Weren't Born Yet!"  April 2015 marked the 150th anniversary of the conclusion of the Civil War. However, there are a few individuals in Washington who seem determined to defy the passage of time. These individuals want to hold white people responsible for events that occurred a century and a half ago. One such individual is Sheila Jackson, who claims to be a freed slave. Yet, the only chain she has ever known is the gold necklace paid for by American taxpayers. She has lived a life of luxury, never missing a meal and enjoying the comforts of first-class travel. To claim that she is a freed slave is just as ignorant as those who once owned slaves. No one has the right to punish others for events that occurred 150 years ago. Similarly, they have no right to appropriate the accomplishments of Dr. King from fifty years ago. Unfortunately, some leaders are turning Dr. King's dream into a nightmare. While Dr. King stood for civil rights and sought to unite all Americans, figures like Al Sharpton do nothing to improve the lives of anyone. Instead, they deepen the divide between black and white communities. It is important to remember that hunger, poverty, and racial discrimination affect individuals of all races. Racism is not inherent; it is taught. It is perpetuated by the ignorance broadcasted on television and preached in churches by individuals like Al Sharpton, who tarnish the title of "Reverend." Perhaps we should gather Al Sharpton and the Westboro Baptist Church together and allow them to confront their own hypocrisy and racism. These individuals need to be held accountable and should be discarded. Millions of Americans struggle every day, while some millionaires in Washington claim they can relate. These individuals represent the top one percent of wealth in our nation and possess far more than the majority of Americans. If we truly want to improve our country, we must start by removing this trash. Trash comes in all colors, and all of it stinks. Semper Fi America, and may God bless us all.   It is disheartening to witness the level of ignorance prevalent in our country. Recently, I came across an article suggesting that Hillary Clinton should be elected solely because it is time for a female president. This line of thinking is monstrously stupid! The level of stupidity displayed by the people in this country is mind-blowing. Can you believe that I even read somewhere that she holds a degree from Yale? It is truly incredible! Do”XÏ	  Expect Electronic Machines to Be Hacked, Be Prepared, Don't Allow Certification  As concerns over election fraud continue to mount, many are worried that the upcoming election may be compromised in favor of Hillary Clinton. President Obama's unwavering confidence in his victory further fuels speculation about the possibility of foul play. Despite being plagued by health issues and a controversial past, Clinton's popularity in the polls continues to rise, while her opponent, Donald Trump, seems to be losing ground. Trump's massive and enthusiastic crowds far outnumber those of Clinton, who relies heavily on union members transported to her events. Anonymous, a well-known hacking group, has also picked up on the possibility of election fraud and has issued a warning to the Trump campaign. According to the group, the manipulated polls are setting the stage for a Clinton victory through electronic vote machine hacking. They urge the American people not to allow this to be the greatest vote theft in history. Anonymous insists that the electronic voting machines were designed to be hacked, and they predict that they will be. After all, it is highly unlikely that the global elite would allow themselves to lose power. Anonymous believes that Clinton will win unless proper measures are taken to counter the vote hacking. They propose one solution for Trump to prevent the alleged election theft: sending a team of two exit pollers, a statistician and an attorney, to each precinct in swing states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, and North Carolina. Whenever irregularities are identified, the team should immediately file an official complaint. Delaying action would only serve the interests of those attempting to rig the election. It is crucial that the complaint be legal in nature, involving law enforcement and potentially the government. The current polls, which show Clinton gaining ground and Trump losing support, are in fact reversed, according to Anonymous. They argue that this is all part of a carefully orchestrated plan to manipulate the election results. By flipping the votes in swing states, Clinton would reluctantly accept the victory, allowing the "evil guys" to triumph. Anonymous concludes that a simple analysis of crowd sizes and polling trends throughout the year clearly demonstrates that as Trump's support grows, Clinton's diminishes. However, the polls consistently show the opposite. This, they claim, is evidence of a deliberate setup to favor Clinton.”Xè	  Donald Trump Fires Back at Accusations Made by Ted Cruz  Hold onto your seats, folks. Brace yourselves for even more chaos in the 2016 presidential race. As previously reported by both this journalist and a colleague, the National Enquirer recently published a story suggesting that Texas Senator Ted Cruz engaged in multiple extramarital affairs. In response, some accused me of being paid off by Donald Trump and his campaign. Let me assure you, that is not the case. Furthermore, comments on my articles and other online platforms suggested that the story was planted due to Mr. Trump's close ties with the National Enquirer's owner.  After maintaining silence on social media for 20 long hours, Donald Trump finally addressed the issue on his Facebook page this afternoon. He stated, "I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this week's issue of the National Enquirer is true or not, but I had absolutely nothing to do with it, did not know about it, and have not, as yet, read it." Trump also took a jab at Cruz, asserting that unlike him, he does not surround himself with political hacks and henchmen and pretend to be innocent. Trump firmly placed the blame on Cruz, stating, "Ted Cruz's problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone."  To complicate matters further, it has been revealed that the reporter who broke the story for the National Enquirer is the same journalist who has previously broken similar stories and even won a Pulitzer. For the record, the National Enquirer denies any collusion between them and Trump. In contrast, Cruz's statement can be described as a non-denial denial, reminiscent of the infamous line, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." Adding to the confusion, one of the women mentioned in the pictures released this morning referred the media to her lawyer. Amanda Carpenter, a former Cruz staffer, echoed Cruz's sentiments. Surprisingly, there is no mention of lawsuits for defamation or libel, which would be justifiable if the story is indeed false. Considering Cruz's background as a lawyer, it raises questions as to why he hasn't sued the National Enquirer and Trump if there is proof of collusion to smear his name.  While there is much more to uncover in this story, the nature of the sources and the knee-jerk reactions from everyone involved indicate that we are far from the truth. For now, we must settle with this incomplete picture. However, the suspicious conduct surrounding this entire situation suggests that someone will not be”Xš   Michele Bachmann, the former congresswoman, has raised concerns about the potential for election theft by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), particularly under the leadership of Jeh Johnson. Bachmann believes that Johnson's recent statements about considering the election system as critical infrastructure is a trial balloon for a direct attack on the electoral process. Johnson's remarks were made during a media conference hosted by the Christian Science Monitor in August. He suggested that the election process should be considered critical infrastructure, much like the financial sector or power grid, due to its vital national interest. The DHS defines critical infrastructure as sectors whose incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on national security, economic security, public health, or safety.  Bachmann argues that Johnson's comments were not accidental, but part of a larger plan. She criticizes President Barack Obama for his alleged disregard for the Constitution and accuses Johnson of failing to uphold the laws regarding border security. Bachmann fears that the current administration could federalize the upcoming elections and potentially manipulate the results to ensure a victory for Hillary Clinton. One possible consequence she envisions is federal officers overseeing voting machines and the federal government taking control of the ballot counting process, which could be problematic given that many voting machines lack a paper trail and are vulnerable to manipulation.  Bachmann believes that if the federal government succeeds in asserting control over the election process, it would be clear evidence of an attempt to steal the election. She urges the public to raise their voices in protest if such a scenario unfolds. In a separate audio clip, she discusses the potential actions Congress could take to address this issue, acknowledging that their willingness to act is uncertain.”Xù   Taxpayer Cash Down The Drain: The EPA's Posh Office Furniture  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), already notorious for being a drain on tax money, has now revealed its penchant for expensive office furniture. While the agency's primary focus should be on tackling pollution and industrial messes, it seems they have taken a detour to indulge in luxury furnishings. Surprisingly, the EPA chose high-end manufacturers Knoll and Herman Miller, spending a staggering $92 million on office furniture. This extravagant shopping spree equates to roughly $6,000 per employee, according to federal spending data provided by OpenTheBooks.com, a government watchdog.  Meanwhile, as private companies and citizens struggle under the weight of government regulations, the EPA lounges comfortably in its plush chairs. "The EPA can't relate to the financial hardships regular Americans face. It's Herman Miller furniture for the bureaucrats, but Ikea for the taxpayers," remarks Adam Andrzejewski, founder of OpenTheBooks.com. It's worth noting that with the same amount of money, one could shop clearance racks and provide clothing for fifteen individuals in need.  The Washington Times has awarded the EPA with their Golden Hammer award for wasteful spending in Washington. This is despite the fact that the agency spent over $70,000 simply to move furniture to replace office carpeting. The EPA claims that new furniture purchases were necessary due to expiring lease agreements and the need for space consolidation between 2000 and 2014. However, it seems that this opportunity was seized upon to acquire designer office furniture.  It is alarming to witness such disregard for fiscal responsibility within the EPA. As taxpayers foot the bill for luxurious furnishings, it becomes increasingly evident that the agency is out of touch with the financial realities faced by average Americans. Perhaps it is time for the EPA to consider more budget-friendly options, such as garage sales or Craigslist, instead of indulging in excessive spending.”XÂ   FBI Documents Confirm Claims of Hillary Clinton's Difficult Behavior  Former First Lady Hillary Clinton has long faced allegations of being unpleasant to work with, particularly from former Secret Service agents. Recent FBI transcripts, released to the public, confirm these reports. An FBI agent from the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) stated during a recent interview that Clinton's treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was contemptuous, leading many of them to seek reassignment or employment elsewhere.  Prior to Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, being an agent on the Secretary's protective detail was considered an honor reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of Clinton's term, the detail was primarily staffed with new agents, as it was challenging to find senior agents willing to work for her.  Furthermore, the transcripts reveal a stark contrast between Clinton and her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, in terms of adherence to security and diplomatic protocols. Rice, known for her strict adherence to State Department protocols, demonstrated a respect for rules that Clinton frequently and blatantly disregarded.  One example of this disregard was Clinton's refusal to travel in an armored limousine with the U.S. ambassador when visiting foreign countries, as is standard diplomatic and security protocol for the Secretary of State. Instead, Clinton chose to be accompanied by her Chief of Staff, Huma Abedin, in the limousine. This breach of protocol often led to complaints from ambassadors who felt insulted and embarrassed.  Clinton's breaches of protocol were well-known within Diplomatic Security and were numerous, according to the FBI transcripts.  These revelations add to the growing legend of the Clinton era, as more security details come forward with comments about Clinton's behavior. It appears that Clinton does as she pleases, without concern for who she may offend.  These quotes are from The Daily Caller.”Xï   Title: Pro-Invasion Racist Group Leader Accuses Americans Defending Their Country of Extremism  In a recent interview on MSNBC, Janet Murguia, the President and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, criticized Americans in Murrieta, CA, who obstructed the path of three Department of Homeland Security (DHS) buses transporting individuals seeking asylum. Murguia referred to these citizens as extremists and vigilantes, expressing her shock and outrage at their ability to influence the situation.  Murguia emphasized the importance of honoring a process, pointing out that the buses contained women and children who were seeking refuge. However, critics argue that this stance disregards the fact that these individuals are in violation of immigration laws. The interviewer failed to address the orchestrated failure to uphold these laws and protect national sovereignty.  Interestingly, the tactics employed by the Murrieta protesters mirror those regularly used by La Raza to demand preferential treatment based on race. Murguia only finds these tactics appropriate when her organization employs them, highlighting the inconsistency in her stance.   The protesters argue that the law being invoked to allow these individuals into the country was strategically placed as a Trojan Horse to facilitate this invasion. Critics claim that socialist groups like La Raza have been laying the groundwork for their takeover for years, exploiting this law to further their agenda while ignoring the violations committed by others.  As everyday Americans defend their country against what they perceive as an invasion, they are labeled extremists by Murguia and her supporters. However, this accusation comes at a time when many Americans have grown weary of being disregarded.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, recognizes the multiple threats our nation, Constitution, and traditions face. He believes they are under a full-scale assault and urges readers to engage with his work on Facebook, Twitter, or his website, www.rickwells.us.”XE
  Rick Perry Trial Continues: Democrats Using Familiar Strategy That Sidelined Sarah Palin  In the cutthroat world of American politics, the left, represented by the Democratic Party, will stop at nothing to prevent individuals they perceive as dangerous to their cause from holding national office. Just as they did with Sarah Palin, the Democrats have employed a similar tactic against Texas Governor Rick Perry, a potential 2016 presidential candidate.  In August, Perry was indicted on two felony charges: abusing his power as governor and coercing a public official. The allegations stemmed from his threat to veto funding for an office whose district attorney refused to step down following a drunk driving conviction. Perry followed through with his threat, prompting the Democratic district attorney to file a lawsuit. While the majority of reasonable individuals fail to see how these actions constitute an abuse of power, the case persists.  This week, a Texas judge rejected Perry's motion to dismiss the charges on technicalities, ensuring that the trial will proceed. This development not only poses a potential distraction to the 2016 presidential race, but also provides ample ammunition for left-leaning publications to generate negative headlines. Already, the Huffington Post has published an article with a headline that reads, "Perry, Considering a Second White House Run, Faces Lingering Criminal Case."  Initially, top national Republicans rallied behind Perry, vehemently denouncing the criminal case against him. However, as the trial drags on, their support has grown quieter. The truth is that Republicans, as well as anyone who objectively follows politics, view this case for what it truly is: an attempt to sideline Perry and prevent his entry into the 2016 presidential race. Why? Because he poses a genuine threat to the Democrats' chances of retaining the White House.  While hard-right conservatives may not view Perry as a significant threat, the opposition certainly does. In recent years, successful governors from southern states have often ascended to the presidency. Perry, as a governor of Texas, undoubtedly fits this mold. Furthermore, Texas has been a prosperous state from various perspectives, making Perry's qualifications even more formidable.  The fact that the left is willing to pursue charges against Perry for actions they would demand if he were a drunken district attorney speaks volumes. It suggests that they possess knowledge about Perry that deeply unsettles them. This is precisely why Perry is receiving the same treatment that Palin did - he is seen as a genuine threat.”X	  "Trump the Chump or Romney Reality: Which is it?"  This Sunday, Fox News Sunday will feature a highly anticipated discussion between Rush Limbaugh and Mitt Romney. The conversation promises to shed more light on Donald Trump's authenticity, as both Limbaugh and Romney offer their perspectives. In the 2012 election, I found myself drawn to Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, due to Romney's ability to evoke the spirit of President Reagan. His demeanor was cool, confident, and humble, qualities I admired. I have always struggled to understand why some establishment Republicans chose to stay home and not vote for Romney/Ryan.  Romney, in his recent speech, issued a grave warning, suggesting that the character of our nation hangs in the balance. He expressed his concerns about Trump's brand of anger, which he believes has led other nations to ruin. Romney criticized Trump's temperament, accusing him of bullying, greed, and misogyny. He even borrowed Marco Rubio's term, labeling Trump a con man. Interestingly, the party's 2008 nominee, John McCain, seemed to echo Romney's concerns, stating that he shared the same worries about Trump. McCain urged voters to carefully consider their choice for the next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world.  Since the Fox debate on March 3, 2016, Trump's behavior has increasingly taken on a childlike quality. He resorted to discussing the size of his hands in relation to his anatomy, a move that appeared both immature and comical. As Trump's consistent name-calling continues, one cannot help but wonder what would become of our society if he were to become our Commander-in-Chief. It is worth noting that Romney's wealth was seen as a negative during his campaign, so why does Trump's wealth not receive the same scrutiny?  We must take Romney's warning seriously; he clearly possesses knowledge that the American people are not privy to. Trump's performance in the debate was marked by evasive answers that sidestepped direct questions. Is this not what we have come to expect from salesmen and politicians? Is Trump truly as tough as his supporters believe, or is he simply an ego-maniac with deep-seated insecurities? When compared to the other three candidates, Trump undeniably stands out. However, I sincerely hope that he loses, as his ego mania reminds me too much of Obama. Our country simply cannot afford another four years with an Obama clone at the helm.”Xt	  Donald Trump Jr. Raises Concerns About Clinton Foundation's Practices  In the midst of a tumultuous 2016 presidential campaign, the Clinton Foundation's alleged misconduct has been overshadowed by the media's focus on other issues. While attention has been primarily directed towards the email scandal and the truth behind Benghazi, Donald Trump Jr., the eldest child of the Republican nominee for President, has chosen to highlight a different aspect. During an appearance on Hannity this week, Trump Jr. expressed his concerns about the Clinton Foundation, specifically questioning its operations and practices.  One major indication of the foundation's questionable practices can be found on Charity Navigator, a prominent website that rates non-profit organizations. A visit to the foundation's page on the site reveals a peculiar message: "Why isn't this organization rated?" Charity Navigator explains that they had previously evaluated the Clinton Foundation but had difficulty capturing its unique business model within their current rating methodology. Their decision to remove the foundation from their site should not be viewed as a condemnation or endorsement of the charity, but rather as a reflection of their inability to accurately assess its operations.   The absence of a rating implies that the Clinton Foundation does not meet Charity Navigator's criteria and does not operate like a typical charity. While some may interpret this as a hesitancy by the organization to rate the foundation poorly, donors can still infer that the foundation's accounting practices deviate from the norm.   Furthermore, the Clinton Foundation's removal from the Charity Navigator Watch List, a list no charity wants to be associated with, is also worth noting. According to Charity Navigator's policy, the foundation was removed from the list in December 2015 after providing publicly accessible information regarding their amended tax forms for several years. This information, along with a public memorandum addressing other concerns raised in the Watch List entry, satisfied the requirements for removal.  Donald Trump Jr.'s comments shed light on the potential irregularities within the Clinton Foundation and the need for further scrutiny. As the election continues to unfold, it is crucial for voters to consider the broader implications of these allegations and their impact on the credibility of the foundation.”XÇ  Ted Nugent Stirs Controversy by Highlighting an Overlooked Detail, Potentially Angering Islamic Extremists  Renowned musician and outspoken conservative Ted Nugent recently ignited a firestorm of debate by shedding light on a seldom-discussed facet of the Islamic faith. In an eyebrow-raising Facebook post, Nugent raised the issue of pork consumption, an act strictly forbidden in the Islamic religion due to the belief that pigs are impure animals.   Nugent's provocative statement, undoubtedly met with mixed reactions, touched upon a rather unexplored topic within the realm of Islamic extremism. By pointing out the Islamic prohibition on pork and pork products, the musician insinuated that these terrorists' expectations of a heavenly afterlife may be met with an unforeseen surprise.  In his social media missive, Nugent conveyed his belief that these militants, driven by their radical ideology, might not have fully considered the implications of their religious commitment. The musician's post, while polarizing, has generated significant discussion regarding the potential consequences these extremists may face in the afterlife.  The controversial nature of Nugent's remarks has sparked a range of responses. Critics have argued that his comments perpetuate Islamophobic stereotypes, pointing out that not all Muslims are terrorists. Others, however, maintain that Nugent has simply identified a little-discussed aspect of the Islamic faith, challenging extremists to reflect on the consequences of their actions.  This latest controversy involving Nugent underscores the ongoing debate surrounding the intersection of religion and terrorism. While religious beliefs are deeply personal and should not be used to generalize entire groups of people, the musician's remarks have opened up a broader discussion about the motivations and understanding of those who commit acts of violence in the name of Islam.  It remains to be seen how these comments will impact the already tense relationship between Western societies and the Muslim world. However, Nugent's bold intervention draws attention to a vital and often overlooked element of Islamic theology, prompting a necessary conversation about the complexities of religious extremism.”XO  In a recent report by New York magazine, Fox News broadcaster Megyn Kelly has come forward with claims that she was sexually harassed by her boss, Roger Ailes. As a result, Ailes has been asked to resign by August 1st or face termination over the allegations. However, 21st Century Fox, the media corporation that owns Fox News Channel, has declined to comment on the matter. Spokespeople for Fox News, the conservative-leaning cable news network founded by Ailes, were also unavailable for comment.  According to two sources, lawyers for 21st Century Fox have given Ailes a deadline to resign or be fired for cause. Ailes' legal team, which now includes Susan Estrich, former campaign manager for Michael Dukakis, has not yet responded to the offer. Sources also indicate that Ailes has sought advice on strategy from Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani. One part of Ailes' strategy has involved attacking Kelly in the press. Ailes' spokesperson, Irena Briganti, has been criticizing Kelly to reporters, accusing her of selfishness for not standing up for the man who gave her career opportunities. Approximately twelve Fox women have praised Ailes since former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed her sexual harassment lawsuit against him. According to a source at Fox, anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle has been leading the pro-Ailes campaign, taking over Carlson's former time slot.  Kelly, a former corporate attorney, alleges that the harassment by Ailes occurred in the mid-2000s when she was a legal correspondent in Fox's Washington bureau. She quickly rose to prominence, regularly appearing on Bill O'Reilly's show and hosting her own legal segments. In 2010, Ailes gave her a two-hour daytime show, and in 2013, he moved her into prime time to replace Sean Hannity at 9 p.m.  The Paul, Weiss lawyers, who have been hired to investigate the sexual harassment claims, are now attempting to interview former Fox employees who have stories of harassment but have remained silent due to settlements with Ailes' attorney, Dianne Brandi. 21st Century Fox has decided to waive the non-disclosure agreements, allowing these women to speak out.”XM  Obama Calls Trump Unfit for Presidency, Criticizes Clinton's Critics  In a recent statement, former President Barack Obama expressed his belief that Donald Trump is not fit to hold the highest office in the country. Obama cited Trump's attack on a Gold Star family, who had made significant sacrifices for the nation, as well as his apparent lack of knowledge about key issues in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.  While Obama's comments garnered attention, some have questioned the lack of similar outrage when Hillary Clinton referred to Patricia Smith, a Gold Star mother, as a liar. Critics argue that this discrepancy reveals the one-sided nature of political discourse or perhaps a lenient treatment of Clinton due to her potential historic significance as the first female president.  Those who see Trump as a threat view his actions through a negative lens, criticizing virtually everything he does. Conversely, they argue that Clinton enjoys a seemingly unimpeded journey, with the liberal press, the FBI, and even Obama himself providing a protective shield. Obama's involvement in the current political landscape is also called into question, as some argue that his role as an acting president ought not to extend to making statements about the presidential race.  However, Obama's willingness to make statements beyond the traditional boundaries of an acting president is not surprising, considering his track record over the past seven and a half years. Critics argue that his previous actions demonstrate a disregard for established norms, thus making it unlikely for him to alter his behavior now.”XÃ
  Title: FBI Director Absent from Terror Summit: Administration Faces Scrutiny  In a surprising turn of events, the Obama administration has come under fire for neglecting to invite the FBI Director, the very person responsible for overseeing the American agency's surveillance efforts on its own citizens, to a recent terror summit. The omission has sparked questions about the administration's priorities and decision-making process.  Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, attempted to provide an explanation during an interview with ABC's John Karl. However, his justifications failed to appease critics who found the move perplexing and potentially detrimental to national security.  One of the reasons given for the FBI Director's absence was the presence of Eric Holder, the outgoing Attorney General, at the summit. The administration argued that since Holder holds a prominent position in U.S. law enforcement, there was no need to invite the FBI Director. This reasoning, however, has been met with skepticism.  Critics argue that the FBI Director, being intimately involved in gathering intelligence on potential violent extremists within the country, is a crucial figure who should have been included. By excluding him, the administration missed an opportunity to ensure the seamless transition of knowledge and expertise once Holder steps down.  Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the administration's decision to focus the summit on community organizing tactics rather than law enforcement strategies. By prioritizing talking points over the expertise of professionals in the field, some argue that the administration missed a crucial opportunity to address the growing threat of violent extremism.  The absence of the FBI Director at the summit has raised questions about the administration's commitment to combating terrorism. While it is important to consider the perspectives of various stakeholders, the exclusion of key individuals responsible for investigating and countering extremism may hinder efforts to effectively tackle the issue.  The controversy surrounding the summit has also shed light on the administration's messaging. Some critics argue that the event seemed more like a jihadi appreciation gathering, focusing on societal factors such as joblessness as the primary motivator for extremism. This narrative has drawn criticism for oversimplifying the complex nature of radicalization and potentially diverting attention from the pressing issue at hand.  As the fallout from this decision continues, concerns about national security persist. It remains to be seen how the administration will address these criticisms and work towards a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to combating terrorism.”Xe  Lou Dobbs Criticizes Bushes and Clintons for Opposing Trump  In a scathing critique, Lou Dobbs has expressed his disappointment in politicians such as Ryan, Romney, the Bush Brothers, and Senators Graham and McCain for failing to support Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. Dobbs argues that these politicians are not only betraying their party but also their country.  Dobbs singles out the Bushes, accusing them of embracing Obama's policies while refusing to back Trump out of animosity. He argues that their refusal to support the Republican voters' choice will effectively aid Hillary Clinton's candidacy, despite knowing that a Clinton presidency would be disastrous for the nation they served. Dobbs particularly emphasizes the irony of George W. Bush, who himself experienced a hotly contested election, failing to recognize his duty to support Trump, the GOP, and the nation.  According to Dobbs, the disloyalty of the political elites and their egoistic elitism is precisely why millions of voters are rejecting career politicians and the failed class of political elites. He believes that Trump's candidacy represents a new era in American history, one that will restore principle, integrity, and prosperity to the government and its citizens.  Dobbs argues that the public arena is where the true debate is happening, and where millions of new voters are making their choices. This surge of voter participation is deeply unsettling to the establishment, which is why, in Dobbs' opinion, the Bushes are withdrawing and reportedly supporting the Clinton campaign. He concludes by stating that there is a reason why 7 in 10 voters oppose political dynasties in America, and Trump has already defeated the Bush family's representative in this election. Dobbs believes that by defeating one more candidate, Trump will broaden the nation's leadership and restore representation for the American people.  In closing, Dobbs challenges the Bushes, Romney, Ryan, and others to either honor the will of the people or accept that they will not be missed as the rest of America works towards making the country great again.”X‚

The bill had overwhelming support and was expected to pass with ease. However, on the eve of the vote, GOP leadership decided to shelve the bill due to concerns raised by GOP women representatives.  The specific concern raised by these women was the reporting requirement for victims of rape or incest who would seek an exemption from the ban. Under the proposed bill, the exemption would only apply if the woman reported the crime to the police. The two GOP women who were named in reports of the closed door meetings are Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Renee Ellmers of North Carolina.  The main worry for these women was the potential backlash in messaging that the Democratic spin machine would generate, particularly among millennials. They feared that the legislation would be portrayed as insensitive and would alienate this key demographic. However, it is worth noting that young people actually support abortion curtailment more than older people do.  The disappointment among the strongly pro-life contingent in the House is palpable. Many believe that a 20-week abortion ban, with strict exceptions, would be beneficial for women. They argue that prosecuting men who commit the crimes of rape and incest, and sparing women the mental anguish of having a late-term abortion, would be in the best interest of everyone involved. Public support for a 20-week abortion ban stands at a rate of 2 to 1.  While the bill has been shelved for now, it is not completely dead. Another bill that would ban federal funds from paying for abortions is coming to the floor of the House today. However, this decision to halt the 20-week abortion ban was seen by many as a fumble, as it was based on uncertain concerns raised by a few GOP women.”XH   Bowe Bergdahl Begins Repatriation Phase of Treatment with Desk Job  Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant who was recently released in a controversial prisoner swap with the Taliban, has successfully completed his post-captivity treatment and is now back on duty. Just six weeks after the trade, Bergdahl has taken up a desk job at the Army North headquarters in Fort Sam Houston, located in San Antonio, Texas. As part of his reintegration process, Bergdahl will also meet with Major General Kenneth R. Dahl, who is currently investigating the desertion charges against him.   The Army describes Bergdahl's transfer from therapy to regular duty as a crucial step in his return to Army life. He will reside in a barracks and be accompanied by minders who will assist him in readjusting to his surroundings. Over the past three weeks, Bergdahl has been receiving outpatient treatment while continuing his debriefings since his release.  Last week, Michigan Democrat Senator Carl Levin, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released letters from each of the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressing their support for Bergdahl's repatriation. The unanimous agreement among the military leaders has raised suspicions that some political maneuvering may have taken place to ensure the return of a suspected deserter. Senator Levin is known for his ability to apply political pressure, as demonstrated by his involvement in the IRS abuse of conservative groups. Critics argue that this unanimous support aligns with the Obama administration's tendency to prioritize political considerations in its decision-making.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, acknowledges the multiple threats that our nation, Constitution, and traditions currently face.

This comes as no surprise, considering Soros' track record of financing anti-American movements. The Democrats, known for their manipulation of racial tensions, are expected to play a significant role in this event, just as they have in the past through organizations like Black Lives Matter and Moveon.org.  However, not all black Americans are falling for the Democrats' deceitful tactics. Some recognize that the real problem lies within the Democrat Party and the communists who have infiltrated it. They understand that slavery, in some form, still persists in America, and that the Democrats, not the Republicans, are the true slave masters hiding behind a facade of progressiveness.  Alfonzo Rachel, a prominent commentator, sheds light on the issue of institutionalized slavery within the Democratic Party. He reveals how many black Americans have been convinced that the Democrats are fighting for their interests, when in reality, they are only perpetuating the cycle of dependency. Through short-term support and asset redistribution, the Democrats create an illusion of progress, akin to socialism or even early stages of communism. However, the rewards of this system can only be maintained as long as black Americans continue to vote in their masters into power.  In a video from last September, Rachel's message resonates even more strongly today. The situation has worsened, thanks to the deliberate actions of the Obama administration and other influential figures like Soros. Rachel warns his fellow black Americans that they are being manipulated and controlled by the Democrats. If only they would listen, there is much to be gained from understanding the truth behind the Democrats' agenda.

The incident, allegedly committed by three young individuals, has raised concerns about the safety of the community and the integration of refugees into American society.  The investigation, currently being conducted by the Twin Falls Police Department, is centered around an incident that is said to have occurred on June 2 near the Fawnbrook Apartments. Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs confirmed the investigation to Idahos First News, but emphasized that charges will only be filed once the police investigation is complete.  However, some individuals have taken it upon themselves to delve deeper into the case, revealing additional details that they believe the media is suppressing. One such individual, Pamela Geller, has conducted her own investigation, shedding light on what she refers to as "brutal facts" about the incident. Geller claims that the alleged perpetrators are Muslim males, and suggests a connection between their actions and Islamic teachings regarding non-Muslim women.  These claims have further divided opinion in Twin Falls, as residents express concerns about the impact of the recent influx of migrants on their community. In a recording of a Twin Falls city council meeting, residents can be heard voicing their apprehension regarding the safety of their community. However, their concerns have largely been disregarded by the council.  The incident has also reignited the debate surrounding the refugee program and its implications for American society. Critics argue that incidents like this highlight the potential risks involved in accepting refugees into the country. Proponents, on the other hand, stress the importance of providing a safe haven for those fleeing war-torn countries and argue that incidents like these should not be used to generalize about an entire group of people.  As the investigation continues, the Twin Falls community finds itself grappling with difficult questions about the balance between compassion and security. The incident is likely to fuel further discussions on immigration policy and the future of the refugee program in the United States.”X®
  Welfare: Europe's Approach Praised  In a groundbreaking ruling this week, the European Court of Justice has received praise from Prime Minister David Cameron for what he deems "simple common sense" and a positive step forward. The ruling, which addresses the issue of benefit tourism, came about due to an appeal by a 25-year-old Romanian woman, Eliazbeto Dano, who had relocated to Germany with her 5-year-old son to live with her sister.   Dano, who had a previous conviction for petty theft in Romania, has been applying for social benefits since her move to Germany in November 2010. Despite having no employment history in either country, she had been receiving Â£150 per month in child benefit payments and approximately Â£100 per month in maintenance payments. Additionally, she had applied twice at the local job center for basic provision benefits, amounting to Â£300 per month, but was denied both times due to her refusal to accept job offers from the center, despite being deemed capable of holding a job.  After making a court appeal, the case was referred to Luxembourg, where it was ultimately rejected. The European Court of Justice supported this decision, stating that economically inactive EU migrants who rely solely on state benefits have no right to move to another country if they cannot financially support themselves. The court declared, "A member state must have the possibility of refusing to grant benefits to economically inactive Union citizens who exercise their right to freedom of movement solely in order to obtain another member state's social assistance, although they do not have sufficient resources to claim a right of residence."  In the United Kingdom, EU migrants are barred from claiming jobseeker's allowance for the first three months of their stay. They are then allowed to claim for the subsequent six months if they can prove they are actively seeking employment, although this period is set to be reduced to three months. After this period, migrants must present compelling evidence that they are actively pursuing employment or risk being denied benefits.  The ruling has received support from the Labour party, who believe that only those who contribute to the economy should have access to welfare benefits. Prime Minister Cameron also expressed his approval, stating, "The right to live and work in another country should not be an unqualified right; there should be rules about restricting benefits and this is good news." Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, echoed this sentiment, calling the ruling "excellent" and emphasizing the belief that individuals who lack the necessary resources to support themselves should not burden national welfare systems.  Overall”X,  Krauthammer Criticizes Obama for Not Naming Islamic Terrorism  In a recent episode of Fox News Special Report, the panel, which included Charles Krauthammer, a former psychiatrist with a medical degree, examined the Obama Administration's response to the video of 21 Coptic Christians being beheaded by ISIS terrorists. The panel specifically focused on the administration's refusal to explicitly label the violence as Islamic terrorism. Dr. Krauthammer expressed his concerns about this issue, highlighting the administration's hesitancy to identify the targets of ISIS, namely Christians.  Dr. Krauthammer emphasized that the video was addressed to the "Nations of the Cross" and pointed out the ongoing attacks on churches in the birthplace of Christianity. He argued that the Obama Administration's labeling of the victims as simply Egyptian citizens, although technically correct, fails to acknowledge the true motive behind their killings. According to Dr. Krauthammer, in order to effectively combat this global threat, it is essential to address the root cause, which the Obama Administration is currently refusing to do.  It is worth noting that in addition to the President, many Republicans in office are also not actively addressing this issue. The lack of action from both parties is contributing to the problem, according to critics.  The current situation has led to widespread criticism of the Obama Administration, with many arguing that the lack of acknowledgement of the Islamic nature of these terrorist acts is hindering efforts to combat this growing threat.”Xø  Fox News Obtains First Draft of Obama's Amnesty Plan; Announcement Expected Next Week  In a recent development, Fox News has obtained exclusive details of President Obama's proposed amnesty plan for illegal aliens. The ten-point plan, set to be announced as early as next week, is expected to stir controversy among those who oppose amnesty and believe in upholding the law. According to Fox News reports, the plan encompasses a range of initiatives, including bolstering border security and enhancing compensation for immigration officers.  This initiative brings to mind the events of 2012 when President Obama circumvented Congress to pass a version of the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act aimed to grant permanent residency to undocumented individuals of good moral character who arrived in the United States as minors. As per the 2012 legislation, these individuals had to have lived continuously in the country for at least five years before the enactment of the bill, and be under the age of 31. However, this new executive action seeks to expand the scope of eligibility to include anyone who entered before the age of 16, shifting the cut-off date from June 2007 to January 1, 2010. This change alone is estimated to make nearly 300,000 illegal immigrants eligible for relief.  Critics argue that this move is primarily motivated by political considerations, asserting that the Democratic Party supports amnesty in order to secure votes from the Latino community. They contend that if Latinos were more inclined to vote Republican, Democrats would likely oppose such measures.  As anticipation builds for the official announcement of Obama's amnesty plan, it remains to be seen how this polarizing issue will be received by the American public and the political landscape as a whole.”X+  Obama Finally Reaches Out to Grieving Family, but Not the Ones You Might Expect  President Barack Obama, known for his famous pen and phone, has been curiously silent in the wake of numerous homicides within the United States. Speculations arose as to whether his phone was broken or simply neglected. However, it appears that whatever issue kept the phone idle has been resolved. Obama has finally utilized his phone to extend condolences to the family of a murder victim. But was it Kate Steinle, the woman tragically killed by an undocumented immigrant? Regrettably, that is not the case. As of now, no member of her family has reported any contact from the President or his officials.   Perhaps Obama reached out to the loved ones of Officer Jessie Hartnett, who was slain by an Islamic terrorist while sitting in his car. Surprisingly, Officer Hartnett received no recognition from the White House. Could it be, then, that the President placed a call to the families of the four Marines and Navy sailor who were brutally killed by a terrorist at a recruiting station? Unfortunately, that is not the case either. The relatives of Carson A. Holmquist, Randall Smith, Thomas J. Sullivan, Squire K. Skip Wells, and David A. Wyatt have been met with a deafening silence.   One might assume that Obama made an effort to reach out to the families of the more than 40 police officers who lost their lives in 2016. However, that assumption would be incorrect. The President has yet to respond to the tragic losses suffered by law enforcement. Instead, the call was made to the husband of the recently slain British Labour MP, Jo Cox. Cox, who was shot and stabbed to death last Thursday, had previously worked on Obama's 2008 campaign team before becoming a Member of Parliament.   Let me be clear, it is commendable that Obama took the time to offer condolences to Cox's family on behalf of the American people. However, I cannot help but question why the same sentiments were not expressed when American citizens lost their lives at the hands of Islamic terrorists and undocumented immigrants.”XÃ  Judge Jeanine Pirro Delivers Scathing Critique of Mitt Romney and Establishment Politics  In a powerful and impassioned monologue, Judge Jeanine Pirro voiced the frustrations of many patriotic Americans who refuse to align themselves with the labels of progressive or conservative. With her trademark ability to distill complex issues into clear and relatable messages, Judge Pirro directed her criticism towards Mitt Romney and his supporters.  She highlighted the growing discontent among the American people, who feel ignored by legislators and betrayed by international agreements that are shrouded in secrecy. Judge Pirro emphasized the desire for transparency and accountability in politics, a sentiment that has fueled the rise of Donald Trump and the rejection of establishment figures.  Not only are politicians feeling the wrath of the people, but the media is also facing criticism. The silent majority is no longer willing to accept the narratives dictated by supposed experts and pundits. The Republican Party's decision to showcase Mitt Romney as a spokesperson for a brokered convention only further underscores the disconnect between the establishment and the grassroots movement.  The judge's remarks have struck a chord with those seeking alternative voices and perspectives. For further analysis and engaging discussion, readers can find insightful comments on this topic in the comments section of Conservative Treehouse.  Judge Jeanine Pirro's strong words serve as a reminder that the American people demand a political landscape that addresses their needs and concerns. Her critique of Mitt Romney and the establishment resonates with those who are seeking genuine change and a departure from the status quo.”X
  ISIS Targets UFC Fighter  In a surprising move, ISIS has set its sights on a rather unconventional target - a UFC fighter. Tim Kennedy, a former Special Forces operative, current National Guard member, and self-defense teacher, seems an unlikely choice for the Islamic extremist group. However, it appears that the ever-intelligent terrorists have taken to social media to threaten Kennedy, prompting the involvement of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Kennedy, who is ranked #6 in the UFC middleweight division, has brushed off the threats, stating that he receives as many as 10 on a daily basis. Unfazed by the cowardly tactics of online tough guys, Kennedy runs a group called Sheepdog Response, where he trains individuals to defend themselves in dangerous situations. With his extensive background in the Army and Mixed Martial Arts, he is not one to back down from a fight.  While ISIS may be gambling on their ability to carry out their mission before time runs out, they should be wary of underestimating Kennedy and the thousands of Americans who share his sentiments. As the sands of time continue to trickle away, it is only a matter of time before a strong-willed leader, unyielding to Islamic sympathizers, takes the helm as President of the United States.  Source: Fox News”X+  In a display of political theatrics, Democratic representatives took to the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday to stage a sit-in in an effort to push for gun control legislation. However, their actions were met with disapproval from some Republican representatives, who were not willing to simply walk away. Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas, in a moment of frustration, confronted his colleagues in a heated exchange. Thanks to the ubiquity of smartphones, a video capturing the altercation quickly spread. While this incident did little to address pressing issues such as terrorism, flaws in the background check system, and the need for a renewed respect for human life in America, it underscored the lack of civility in government. It also highlighted the fact that some politicians have yet to mature and realize that sit-ins are no longer effective means of protest. Despite the rejection of their ideals, the occupy crowd continues to cling to outdated beliefs from half a century ago. As Representative Gohmert attempted to admonish these "overgrown hippies," it is clear that the debate around gun control remains unresolved. Perhaps, instead of engaging in shouting matches, the focus should be on fostering a sense of love and unity by learning to protect one's neighbors from potential harm.”Xó	  In the early hours of Saturday morning, a horrifying incident unfolded in south Bakersfield, leaving more than a dozen children injured in a gang-style attack. Walter Vides had just returned home from work when he heard a barrage of gunfire erupting from across the street. The source of the chaos was a house party, attended by over 100 people, which had spiraled into violence. Two gun-wielding teenagers, along with a third suspect who had been ejected from the party, unleashed a hail of bullets on the attendees, many of whom were as young as 13 years old. The attackers remain at large.  Vides, witnessing the terrifying scene from his doorway, saw a 16-year-old girl shot in the shoulder as she desperately sought shelter behind his garage. Meanwhile, a 13 or 14-year-old boy with a leg wound struggled to hop over a fence, and numerous others fled for their lives. In the midst of the chaos, at least one party guest bravely returned fire, according to the police. Authorities suspect that the shootout, which took place on Stephens Drive, was gang-related.  Across the street, Vides observed a man lying in the gutter near a blue Chevrolet Tahoe, suffering from a head wound, one of the most severe injuries of the night. Panic ensued as people tried to escape, desperately searching for their family members. Another bullet grazed a man named Jesse, who Vides claimed owned the house where the party was held. The bullet tore off a portion of his ear. Later that day, Jesse returned home, still wearing a hospital gown and with a blood-soaked bandage wrapped around his head. Vides also mentioned that Jesse's daughter, who had her parents' permission to host the party but inadvertently attracted unwanted guests by promoting the event on social media, was also shot.  This early morning shootout stands as the most devastating incident in the city this year, amidst a surge in violent shootings in the Bakersfield area. Since the beginning of April, at least 50 such shootings have occurred, resulting in the deaths of over two dozen individuals â€“ surpassing last year's tally of 15 gunfire-related homicides across Bakersfield.  According to Ray Pruitt, a public information officer with the Kern County Sheriff's Office, the three perpetrators, described as black teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19, arrived in a vehicle and opened fire on the party-goers. While investigators have encountered challenges in obtaining information from both victims and witnesses, Pruitt asserted that those present at the party likely know the”X¬   White House Dismisses Claims by 13-Year-Old CJ Pearson, Prompting a Sharp Rebuttal  In a recent turn of events, the White House found itself embroiled in a heated exchange with 13-year-old CJ Pearson, who accused President Obama of lying. Pearson, an outspoken young black teen, had been using his platform to call out the President's alleged falsehoods. However, his efforts to secure an interview with President Obama were met with resistance, as he discovered that his Twitter account had been blocked by either the President or his staff, who operate the official @POTUS account.  Pearson, undeterred by this setback, took a screenshot of the message he received, clearly indicating that he had been blocked from the account. As public outcry grew and criticism of the administration's immaturity mounted, Assistant Press Secretary Frank Benenati responded by dismissing Pearson's claims, essentially accusing the 13-year-old of lying. This response did not sit well with Pearson, who swiftly fired back, prompting the Obama administration to face further scrutiny.  The incident has raised questions about the White House's handling of dissenting voices and its willingness to engage with critics, particularly when they are as young as Pearson. Many have criticized the administration for its alleged preference for extending invitations to illegal immigrants and young Muslims who have garnered media attention, such as the case of Ahmed Mohamed, who was famously involved in a controversy surrounding a clock that resembled a bomb.  While the White House maintains that no one has ever been blocked from the @POTUS Twitter account, Pearson's evidence suggests otherwise. The teenager's response to being labeled a liar has not only ignited a fierce debate but also raised doubts about the administration's credibility.  To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, viewers are encouraged to watch the video by clicking on CJ Pearson's name.”XU   [Watch] Video Contradictions: Obama's Evolving Stance on Iraq War  In a surprising turn of events, President Obama's narrative on the War in Iraq has come under scrutiny. For years, he has proudly proclaimed his role in ending the war, but recent revelations suggest that his involvement may not have been as significant as previously believed. Perhaps, in hindsight, it would have been wiser for him to refrain from making any claims or statements at all. However, it seems that the allure of basking in the glory of his accomplishments before his loyal supporters was too irresistible for him to resist.  Now, in an attempt to revise history, President Obama is distancing himself from the decision to end the war and withdraw all forces from Iraq. He claims that he was not involved in the process and that the responsibility lies with others, including George Bush and al-Maliki. According to him, he is merely an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire.  A video has emerged that highlights the absurdity and duplicity of President Obama's claims. It questions the consistency of his statements and presents a stark contrast to his previous assertions. This video has sparked a renewed debate over the true extent of his involvement in the Iraq War and the subsequent withdrawal.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, has taken note of these developments. He recognizes that our nation, our Constitution, and our traditions are currently facing numerous threats. With this in mind, he urges readers to support his cause by liking him on Facebook, following him on Twitter, or visiting his website www.rickwells.us.  It remains to be seen how this controversy will unfold and whether President Obama's evolving stance on the Iraq War will have any lasting impact. As the debate continues, the American public eagerly awaits further clarification from the former president.”Xö	  Obama Criticized for Not Taking Stronger Stance Against White Supremacy, According to Cornel West  In a recent appearance on CNN, Cornel West, a self-described non-Marxist socialist and honorary chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America, took the opportunity to criticize white people and patriotic Americans. West's view that he supports an illegitimate philosophy is underscored by his affiliation with the Marxist ideology, despite his claim of being a non-Marxist socialist. It is important to note that Marxism does not make exceptions based on individual declarations, such as West's identification as a Christian.  Furthermore, West was a prominent supporter of Bernie Sanders, who has now endorsed Hillary Clinton. West's advocacy for black supremacy and his revolutionary agenda to overthrow Constitutional America are well-documented. Given his views, it is unsurprising that West has found a platform on CNN, where he frequently attacks white individuals.  West begins his tirade by defending former President Barack Obama, claiming that white supremacy has shaped the American empire and democracy. This rhetoric echoes the sentiment of blaming white individuals for the success of the country, a common refrain from those who choose not to participate actively in society. Instead of contributing constructively, they prefer to criticize and incite unrest.  West goes on to argue that Obama did not do enough to dismantle America, suggesting that he should have taken a more aggressive approach. This claim, made by a radical communist, is quite disconcerting. West also perpetuates the debunked notion that police do not value the lives of black individuals, despite statistics showing that black suspects are shot less frequently than their white counterparts. He advocates for civilian boards and empowerment of radicals over the police, a strategy shared by figures such as Al Sharpton and Loretta Lynch, who seek to undermine the Constitutional government and consolidate power for themselves.  While the conversation veers away from the urgent need for the country to heal from the communist influence of the past eight years under Obama, West promotes Black Lives Matter as an international democratic movement. This characterization overlooks the controversial nature of the organization and its divisive tactics.  It is essential to critically examine the arguments put forth by individuals like West, who use their influence to perpetuate damaging narratives and promote agendas that undermine the fabric of our society.”X/   "An Eye-Opening Experience: Black Lives Matter Leader Confronts Deadly Force and Gains New Perspective on Policing"  In the wake of the tragic shooting of 11 police officers in Dallas, tensions surrounding the treatment of young black men by law enforcement have reached unprecedented heights. Despite statistics indicating otherwise, many individuals from the black community feel unfairly targeted by police. Seeking to bridge this gap and foster empathy, the Maricopa County Police Department offered a unique opportunity to Jarrett Maupin, a prominent figure in the Black Lives Matter movement. Maupin was given the chance to step into the shoes of a police officer and face the difficult decisions they encounter daily.  To provide a realistic experience, Maupin was handed a gun and placed in various scenarios where he had to determine when to employ deadly force. The outcomes proved enlightening. In the first scenario, Maupin hesitated and ultimately found himself shot. The second scenario echoed the circumstances surrounding the Michael Brown case, with the suspect approaching the officer aggressively, although unarmed. Fearing for his own safety, Maupin made the difficult decision to shoot. However, in the third scenario, with the suspect restrained and no visible weapon, Maupin recognized that deadly force was unnecessary, contrasting with the Alton Sterling incident.  Following the exercise, Maupin expressed a newfound understanding of the importance of complying with an officer's orders. He acknowledged that non-compliance remained a common thread in these situations. This immersive encounter allowed one protester to gain insight into the demanding nature of law enforcement. It reminds us of the selfless work our police officers undertake every day, and the challenges they face in maintaining public safety.”X•
  Title: Iranian Women Face Seizure of Vehicles for Improper Veiling, Prompting Criticism  In Tehran, Iranian women are being subjected to strict veiling regulations, raising concerns among feminists and advocates for women's rights. General Teymour Hosseini, the chief of police in the Iranian capital, recently issued a warning, stating that failure to wear the proper veil, as dictated by the nation's faith, would lead to severe consequences. If a female driver is found to be poorly veiled or without a veil, her vehicle will be seized in accordance with the law, as reported by the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA). To reclaim their vehicles, women will have to obtain a court order, adding further complications to an already restrictive situation.  This move by the Tehran police highlights the extent to which Iranian women are expected to conform to specific societal expectations. Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani, the judiciary chief of Iran, expressed concern over the growing number of women flaunting the veiling regulations in the streets of the capital, describing them as resembling fashion salons. This situation has prompted questions about the level of tolerance within Iranian society.  Since the hardline takeover in 1979, Iranian women have resisted the strict veiling rules imposed upon them. Last year, a Facebook page titled "My Stealthy Freedom" gained widespread attention in the West. The page features Iranian women posting photos of themselves without headscarves, enjoying the brief moments of freedom they can experience by going bareheaded - a simple act that many take for granted. These women often only reveal their backs, with their flowing locks cascading down their waists, against remote backgrounds, fearing identification and potential repercussions.  Now, even within the confines of their own cars, Iranian women are being denied the freedom to express themselves. They are required to conform to the expectations set by the Tehran police. This raises an important question: Why does this regime seemingly receive a pass in the international discourse on the war on women? Impounding vehicles because a woman's hair is exposed appears to be a more severe blow to her dignity than efforts to prevent women and girls from undergoing dangerous procedures that impact their bodies and minds, haunting them for life.  Critics argue that the war on women feminists should reevaluate their priorities. However, it is important to note that this opinion comes from a Catholic writer, whose views may not be universally accepted.  In conclusion, the recent enforcement of strict veiling regulations in Tehran has drawn attention to the plight of Iranian women. Their struggle for”Xí  Terrorist Groups Unite? Sheriff David Clarke Suggests Black Lives Matter Will Join with ISIS to Take America Down  Sheriff David Clarke, known for his refusal to engage in left-wing race baiting, has once again made headlines with his outspoken criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement. In a recent tweet, he suggested that the group could potentially join forces with ISIS to bring America to its knees.  While some may find Sheriff Clarke's statement extreme, it is worth noting that he has been proven right in the past. He has been vocal about exposing President Obama's role in starting a so-called "war on police" and his failure to be honest with the black community. Additionally, Sheriff Clarke has shed light on the media's manipulation of black individuals, arguing that they have been under the control of Democrats for the past six decades.  In a recent interview with Hannity, Sheriff Clarke provided data to support his claims that Obama, the media, and Hollywood have engaged in a propaganda campaign against the police, portraying them as racists. He pointed out that between 2009 and 2012, there were 1,491 instances of deadly force used by police officers. Of those involved, 61 percent were white males and 32 percent were black males, indicating that white males actually have a higher claim on police use of force. Furthermore, he highlighted that only 0.04 percent of black homicide perpetrators were police officers, while 93 percent were committed by other black individuals.  Sheriff David Clarke's fearless portrayal of today's Democratic party has made him a target for liberals. Despite facing racial slurs and death threats, he continues to fight for the truth. His unwavering dedication is commendable and exactly what this country needs.”XŒ
  Trump's Recital of "The Vicious Snake" Goes Viral  Donald Trump showcased his impressive vocal skills during a recent fundraiser, captivating the audience with a recitation of the poem "The Vicious Snake." The poem was perfectly synchronized with a film, enhancing its impact as Trump delivered it with remarkable pause, emotional tone, and triumphant vocal chords. His delivery was both powerful and clear, evoking a profound emotional response as viewers witnessed the accompanying images and live clips.  In the concluding verses, the poem shed light on the turmoil in Europe caused by refugee rampages, serving as a cautionary tale for American society. Trump's recitation underscored the potential consequences of allowing refugees to freely enter our borders, highlighting the alarming similarities between our nation and Europe. His poetic prowess deserves recognition for effectively conveying this message.  I personally interpret the poem as a metaphor for Barack Hussein Obama's advocacy for admitting these impoverished refugees into our nation. Obama, like the snake in the poem, implores the American people to embrace his vision of a compassionate and welcoming country, citing our history as a nation of immigrants. However, I harbor no doubts about his motives and manipulative efforts to achieve his ideological goals for America. I have witnessed firsthand his deceitful actions, including lies, cover-ups, and clandestine meetings at the White House. He even enacted laws when Congress was on recess, displaying a disregard for the democratic process.  The corrupt Obama regime, encompassing individuals such as Lois Learner of the IRS, Hillary R Clinton, and the Head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, alongside other Washington cronies, have shamelessly ingratiated themselves with the President in exchange for promotions, bonuses, trips, and financial gain. Obama's famous declaration in 2008 that he would "fundamentally change America" was not an empty promise; he has spent the past seven years imposing his agenda on the American people without their consent. He has resorted to lies and manipulation, just like the vicious snake in Trump's video.  If we allow a significant influx of Muslim refugees, numbering around 100,000 or more, to enter our country, we risk experiencing the same chaos witnessed in Europe. Like the snake in the poem, these refugees will engage in criminal activities, including rape, theft, and the desecration of our landscapes and city streets with mountains of trash. They will even resort to acts of terrorism on American soil, as they have done elsewhere. The cunning nature of this vicious snake, personified by Obama, has devoured our”X¥
  "Protests Erupt as Racial Debate Sweeps Nation Over the Death of Unarmed Black Men"  The recent deaths of two unarmed black men have sparked widespread protests and ignited a heated racial debate throughout the country. Liberals argue that white privilege is to blame for the disproportionate arrest rates between white and black individuals. While it is undeniable that white privilege has persisted throughout American history, one cannot solely attribute this issue to white people. The overwhelming amount of crime occurring in black communities plays a significant role in the profiling of black individuals. If civil rights leaders and our president truly seek to address this problem, they must shift their focus from solely on the police and instead examine the reasons behind their presence in these communities. While I do not deny the existence of racist police officers, it is common sense that police are more likely to patrol areas with higher crime rates. Unfortunately, liberals often disregard common sense, as demonstrated by their latest race-baiting endeavor.  In response to the lack of indictment in the Eric Garner case, white liberals have taken to Twitter to confess crimes they have committed without facing significant consequences, using the hashtag #Crimingwhilewhite. They argue that this digital movement mirrors the ongoing protest movements across the country. Here are a few examples:  However, the numbers do not support the notion that police solely target black individuals. Statistics reveal that more white people are killed by the police than black people, and a mere 0.1% of arrests result in death. In 2012, 123 black individuals were fatally shot by police, while 326 white individuals suffered the same fate. Figures like these are conveniently ignored by race-baiters like Al Sharpton. Racism undoubtedly persists, but we have made significant progress. A person of mixed race currently holds one of the most influential positions in the world. Blaming skin color for one's lack of success only benefits networks like MSNBC. It is crucial to promote inclusivity and equality for all.  I respect and cherish all individuals, but I harbor a disdain for Islam. #NOTcrimingwhilewhite. Lol hahaha hehehe. Recently, I have observed new placards on television advocating for the importance of Black lives. However, I cannot help but wonder why the countless black babies aborted in this country each year do not receive the same level of attention. Why don't their lives matter? Similarly, the staggering number of young black men being murdered by other young black men raises questions about why their lives are not valued. Where is the outrage for the tens of thousands of black lives”X¢  URGENT: Sheriff Joe Arpaio Fights for His Freedom, Calls for Patriots' Support  PHOENIX, AZ â€” As the re-election looms just two weeks away, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio finds himself in a challenging position. For the past three years, the U.S. Department of Justice has been relentlessly pursuing him, accusing him of intentionally racial profiling Latinos during traffic stops. Arpaio has admitted to violating the terms of the order, but maintains that his actions were unintentional. Prosecutors are seeking a jail term of up to six months for the 84-year-old sheriff.  Arpaio, known as the world's toughest sheriff, enjoys immense support from the citizens and conservatives who credit his force with protecting them from drug dealers and dangerous criminals who illegally cross the Mexican border into the country every day. Having been elected and served six terms, Arpaio is currently vying for a seventh.  However, the situation does not bode well for Arpaio. On Tuesday, he was formally charged with criminal contempt-of-court for disregarding a judge's order in a three-year-old racial profiling case instigated by Latinos and the Department of Justice under the Obama administration. Arpaio's lawyer, Mel McDonald, asserts that the sheriff will plead not guilty, confident that he will eventually be vindicated.  In a startling twist, the presiding liberal judge has ordered the courts to provide compensation to Latinos who were subjected to illegal detentions by Arpaio, despite his violation of the order. To fund this compensation, an amount of $1 million, drawn from taxpayers' dollars, has been allocated. This development has raised concerns among supporters of Arpaio, who view it as a form of persecution by the judge against the citizens, alongside the sheriff.  The citizens, however, remain steadfast in their support for Sheriff Joe and his unwavering commitment to law and order. They believe he is being unjustly crucified by a liberal court system and Obama's Department of Justice. A trial for Arpaio's criminal contempt case has been scheduled for December 6. Supporters are urged to keep him in their prayers.

The group's attacks have spilled over into neighboring Cameroon, prompting Ghana's President John Mahama to call for African leaders to develop a collective plan of action against the militants. "This has to end. We have to make this terror end," Mahama stated. Boko Haram has been waging a six-year insurgency, capturing towns and villages in northeast Nigeria, and more recently, threatening Nigeria's neighboring countries in an attempt to establish an Islamic caliphate. Mahama emphasized the need for African nations to come together to share information, synchronize strategies, and pool resources in order to eliminate terrorism from the entire continent. "We cannot stand by silently, idly waiting for the international community to intervene on our behalf," he added.  The most recent Boko Haram attack occurred on Sunday, January 18, where dozens of people were kidnapped and four villagers were killed. The attackers reportedly fled towards Nigeria, and according to Nigerian officials, around 30 adults and 50 children between the ages of 10 and 15 were kidnapped. Cameroonian Information Minister, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, stated that an investigation is underway to determine the exact number of kidnapped individuals, but confirmed that almost 80 houses were burned down during the attack. The villages of Maki and Mada in the Tourou district near Mokolo city in Cameroon's Far North region, which is approximately four miles from Nigeria, were targeted.  Boko Haram's violence has been widely condemned by the United States, the United Nations, and other nations. International aid organizations are working to provide assistance to survivors. However, the international community's attention has primarily been focused on the terror attacks in Paris. Boko Haram first gained international attention and condemnation when they abducted over 200 girls from a school in Chibok, Nigeria, in April. Chad has offered to send troops to assist Cameroon after the country reported killing 143 jihadists during an attack on its military base in Kolofata. A unit of Chadian troops reportedly arrived on Sunday. The French government has suggested that Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Niger each contribute 700 troops to a multinational force, but so far, there has been little progress on this proposal.”XN  Title: Disturbing Video Exposes Alarming Display of Racism Towards White Individuals  In a deeply unsettling video that has recently come to light, a group of individuals can be seen engaging in overtly racist behavior towards innocent white passersby. While the footage is undeniably distressing, it serves as a stark reminder that such abhorrent ideologies still find a place within our society. It is disheartening to acknowledge that there are individuals who subscribe to these reprehensible beliefs, and it is crucial that we confront this issue head-on.  The actions captured in the video are nothing short of despicable. To refer to the perpetrators as mere individuals seems inadequate; their behavior is more akin to that of animals. These individuals harbor the disturbing notion that women desire to be subjected to the unfathomable crime of rape. Moreover, they erroneously blame white people for the perceived inadequacies in their own lives. Such misguided beliefs only serve to perpetuate division and hatred within our society.  When the media addresses the topic of racism, it predominantly focuses on instances of discrimination against black individuals by white individuals. Regrettably, the portrayal of racism in this manner fails to acknowledge that prejudice can manifest in multiple directions. The absence of videos depicting racism against white individuals can be attributed to a reluctance among some to confront the uncomfortable truth that racism is not exclusive to one race or another. This video serves as an unequivocal reminder that racism, in its truest form, manifests in various ways throughout America.  It is incumbent upon us as a society to confront and combat racism in all its manifestations. We must educate ourselves and others about the extent of this issue, acknowledging that it is not confined to one race or group. By fostering empathy, understanding, and open dialogue, we can work towards a future where such displays of racism are eradicated. Together, we can strive for a more inclusive and equitable society, one that rejects all forms of discrimination and prejudice.”Xé  Controversial Australian-born moral philosopher, Peter Singer, has once again sparked debate with his unconventional views on babies, fetuses, and the treatment of animals. Singer has previously suggested that mothers should have the option to terminate a child after birth, and he firmly believes that all animals, including humans, should have equal rights. Despite his humanistic atheism, Singer continues to be invited to speak at bioethics and philosophy conferences. However, his recent viewpoints expressed in a Swiss newspaper in May have led to his uninvitation from a philosophy festival in Cologne called phil.Cologne.  In the interview with Neue Zuricher Zeitung, Singer challenges the idea that belonging to the human species automatically grants a right to life, while other species do not have the same privilege. He argues that this belief is rooted in religious teachings that have been ingrained in society for centuries. When asked about a hypothetical situation where he must choose between saving 200 pigs or one child from a burning house, Singer controversially suggests that the animals' suffering may reach a point where it becomes more justifiable to save them instead of the child. He acknowledges that determining this point is subjective and unclear, but he emphasizes that saving an infinite number of animals at the expense of one child's life is unacceptable.  The conversation takes an even more unsettling turn when Singer is questioned about his own worth and whether he would be willing to torture a baby if it meant bringing permanent happiness to mankind. Singer refers to Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov" and admits that, although it goes against his inherent nature to harm children, he believes it would be the right thing to do if it prevented the future torture of thousands of children.  These viewpoints may seem unfathomable to many, as the instinct to protect and care for offspring is deeply ingrained in every species that gives birth to young. If humans are to be considered equals to other animals, one would assume this instinctual caregiving should be inherent as well. Singer's controversial beliefs continue to challenge traditional moral frameworks and provoke intense debate among scholars and the general public alike.”Xž  Paul Ryan Implicated in Leaking Trump Tape, Sparking Outrage and Suspicion of GOP Coup  In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan may be the source behind the leaked tape of Donald Trump and Billy Bush. Jack Posobiec, the Special Projects Director for Citizens For Trump, has shed light on what he calls a tale of deceit and treachery orchestrated by Ryan and his cohorts.  The leaked tape, which caused a media firestorm and threatened to derail Trump's presidential campaign, was initially celebrated by anti-Trump operatives without investigating its origin. Ryan, who has long been at odds with Trump, planned to stage a show of indignation at an event in Wisconsin, using it as an opportunity to distance himself from the Republican nominee along with other party members like Senator Mike Lee of Utah. The endgame was to replace Trump with Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence, allowing Ryan to slide into the top spot on the ticket for a future run in 2020.  However, this alleged coup failed to gain traction, and the true orchestrators are now being exposed. The consequences for their actions remain to be seen, but it is clear that the fallout from this revelation will be significant.

  Opinion | Why I'm Voting Democrat This Year, and Why You Should Too  As an ardent patriot, I have always held a deep love for my country. It was with great enthusiasm that I witnessed the rise of Barack Obama, as he vowed to bring about meaningful change during his tenure in office. Intrigued by this transformative promise, I have compiled a comprehensive list of ten compelling reasons why I enthusiastically support the Democratic Party. I invite you to join me on this journey, as we explore the myriad motivations that make voting Democrat a crucial choice for the betterment of our nation.  1. Economic Equality: The Democrats have consistently championed policies aimed at narrowing the wealth gap and ensuring a fairer distribution of resources. By prioritizing the needs of the middle class and working families, Democrats strive to create an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few.  2. Healthcare for All: In the face of a global pandemic, the importance of accessible healthcare has been laid bare. Democrats have consistently advocated for universal healthcare, recognizing that no individual should be denied medical assistance due to their socio-economic status. By providing affordable and comprehensive healthcare coverage for all Americans, Democrats prioritize the well-being of our nation.  3. Climate Change Action: Science has unequivocally shown that climate change poses a grave threat to our planet and future generations. Democrats have demonstrated a commitment to combating this existential crisis by championing renewable energy sources, international environmental agreements, and sustainable policies that ensure a clean and secure future for our children.  4. Social Justice: The Democratic Party has been at the forefront of the fight for civil rights, gender equality, and LGBTQ+ rights. By advocating for justice and equality for all, Democrats work towards a more inclusive society that values diversity and combats discrimination in all its forms.  5. Gun Control: The alarming frequency of mass shootings has underscored the urgent need for comprehensive gun control measures. Democrats have consistently pushed for common-sense gun reforms, including universal background checks and closing loopholes, to ensure the safety of our communities without infringing upon the Second Amendment rights of responsible gun owners.  6. Education: Democrats recognize that investing in education is an investment in our nation's future. By advocating for increased funding for public schools, affordable college tuition, and vocational training opportunities, Democrats strive to provide every child with the tools they need to succeed.  7. Immigration Reform: Our nation's immigration system is in dire need of comprehensive reform. Democrats have consistently championed policies that promote a fair and humane approach to immigration, recognizing the invaluable”Xì	  FROM ST. LOUIS...Awaiting Grand Jury Decision, Tensions Rise  By Romeo Foxtrot  ST. LOUIS â€” The anticipated announcement of whether or not to indict Darren Wilson, the Ferguson, Missouri police officer involved in the shooting death of Michael Brown, has been met with delay, leaving the city on edge. Speculation surrounds the reasons behind the delay, with official explanations conflicting with rumors from courthouse insiders. As St. Louis residents, we find ourselves reluctantly preparing for a potential conflict, while hoping for a reprieve in the form of a snowstorm. We are eager to move forward, but behind-the-scenes activities continue.  To be clear, this situation has resulted in fear among many white residents and anger among many black residents. These sentiments were recently expressed on a Facebook feed, although the language used was quite explicit. It is important to note that these emotions are shared by individuals who have been victimized by the unrest. They have worked tirelessly to build a community based on respect and love, only to have their efforts undermined by a few troublemakers. It is crucial to recognize that the destructive behavior is not representative of the entire black community. They, too, do not want this violence any more than the rest of us do. Incidents like the defacement of a historic landmark in the Shaw Neighborhood, pictured below, only serve to further fuel their anger. Removing graffiti from limestone is no easy task, and we can only expect such acts to continue regardless of the grand jury's decision.  Let it be clear, St. Louisans are not going to abandon what they have worked so hard to build. We will not simply turn off the lights and leave. We are a resilient community, just like any other productive American city. However, it is important to address the destruction of property that has occurred during the riots. Such actions are unequivocally wrong.  Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to arrest Darren Wilson lies with the grand jury. Everything else at this point is mere speculation. While I agree with the sentiment of this article, I must express my disagreement with one aspect: the unnecessary reference to marijuana. In reality, Michael Brown had only trace amounts of marijuana in his system, and it had no bearing on his actions or words. It is crucial to ensure that even the smallest details are accurate.   In St. Louis, we are eagerly awaiting the grand jury decision, hoping for a resolution that can help heal our divided community.”XM   Ted Cruz Refuses to Deny Infidelity Allegations; Carly Fiorina Comes to His Defense  In the tradition of blaming George Bush for every woe suffered by President Obama, Senator Ted Cruz has found his own scapegoat in Donald Trump. Cruz, who has been hailed by Glenn Beck as the righteous successor to the world throne, now attributes all the negatives in his life to Trump. To further bolster his defense, he has enlisted the support of his running mate, Carly Fiorina.   When asked a seemingly simple question about whether he would dispute the National Enquirer's claims of infidelity, Cruz appeared unsure of how to respond. Fiorina stepped in, disregarding the reporter's objection and offering to answer the question herself. The reporter questioned her firsthand knowledge of Cruz's marriage, but Fiorina insisted on commenting, reciting a script that blamed Trump for the allegations.   It is clear that Fiorina's emotions were still raw from Trump's previous remarks about her appearance, as she passionately accused the media of dancing to Trump's tune. She referred to Trump as a serial philanderer and dismissed the Enquirer's story as scurrilous and ridiculous.   The reporter, however, pushed for a straightforward answer about Cruz's character. Cruz, in turn, attacked the reporter for supposedly dwelling in the gutter and smirked at his affiliation with the Daily Mail. Fiorina joined in, claiming that they had also been pursued by the publication.  This exchange demonstrates the ongoing tension between Cruz, Trump, and the media. While important issues such as the recent terrorist attack in Brussels and the president's interactions with Raul Castro should take precedence, the allegations of infidelity continue to haunt Cruz's campaign. The senator's refusal to definitively deny the allegations raises questions about his character and integrity.”XN
  Title: Conflict Emerges as Veteran Faces Flag Dispute in Indiana Neighborhood  GREENFIELD, Indiana â€” Robert and Judy Willits, residents of the Fieldstone Housing Addition, have found themselves embroiled in a bitter dispute with their homeowners association (HOA) over the display of American flags in their front yard. The Willits, who moved to this neighborhood last Christmas, are both staunch patriots who value the symbolism of the flag. Robert, a Korean War veteran who was seriously injured in combat, had eagerly built a flagpole over the summer to proudly fly the American flag he fought for, alongside the MIA flag.  However, their joy was short-lived, as the couple recently received a letter from their HOA, notifying them that their display violated the association's regulations. The HOA demanded that the flagpole be removed or face financial penalties. The Willits were taken aback by the association's decision, feeling it was an affront to their values and to the sacrifice Robert had made for his country.  "I am not taking it down," Willits stated defiantly, adding, "That flag is for the freedom of every person in here. It represents freedom. Lester is still out there. So I'm going to keep it up." Judy, his wife, echoed his sentiment, expressing her disappointment at the association's lack of support towards a 100% disabled veteran.  In a show of solidarity, a group of local veterans gathered around the flagpole on Monday to support the Willits' stance. Despite the HOA's threat of fines and potential legal action, Willits remains resolute, stating that he would not pay the fine and would not remove the flags.  The homeowners association, on the other hand, is still deliberating on the appropriate course of action if the Willits continue to defy their directive. Both parties involved have enlisted the services of legal representation to navigate this contentious issue.  The Willits' story has garnered significant attention, drawing support from fellow Americans who believe that veterans should be able to proudly display the American flag as a symbol of their service and the freedoms they fought to protect. Messages of encouragement have poured in from across the country, with many praising the Willits for their unwavering commitment to their principles.  While this dispute may seem to revolve around a simple flag display, it raises deeper questions about the role of homeowners associations and the limits of their authority. Some critics argue that the HOA's strict regulations encroach upon personal freedoms, while others contend that adherence to these rules is necessary for maintaining”X!	  Title: Pastor Manning Predicts Putin Will Publicly Expose Obama's Alleged Homosexuality within 100 Days  In a recent online video, Reverend James David Manning, an outspoken pastor from Harlem, has made a bold prediction that Russian President Vladimir Putin will reveal President Barack Obama's alleged homosexuality within the next 100 days. The video, titled "Turd Burglar," has gained attention for its controversial content and provocative language.  Reverend Manning, known for his inflammatory statements and strong opposition to Obama's policies, claims to have insider information regarding the President's personal life. In the video, he accuses Obama of engaging in homosexual activities and suggests that Putin, known for his strong stance against homosexuality, has obtained evidence to support these claims.  While these allegations lack substantiation, Reverend Manning argues that Putin's strong anti-gay stance and his alleged possession of evidence could lead to a public revelation about Obama's sexuality. He suggests that Putin, with his strong influence and disregard for political correctness, may choose to use this information to discredit Obama and further tarnish his reputation.  It is essential to note that these claims remain unverified and lack concrete evidence. The video released by Reverend Manning serves as a platform for his personal beliefs rather than factual reporting. However, it highlights the persistence of conspiracy theories surrounding Obama's personal life, which have emerged throughout his presidency.  This video has reignited the ongoing debate surrounding the role of personal attacks and unsubstantiated rumors in political discourse. Critics argue that such claims, lacking evidence, undermine the credibility of individuals involved and divert attention from issues of substance. Moreover, they suggest that these tactics contribute to a toxic political environment, hindering constructive dialogue and progress.  As we await further developments, it is important to approach these allegations with skepticism, demanding verifiable evidence before accepting them as fact. In an era of widespread misinformation and baseless claims, it is crucial to prioritize responsible journalism, relying on reliable sources and factual reporting to navigate the complex political landscape.”XW  (WATCH) NFL Players Hilariously Unveiled in New Installment of Bad Lip Reading  After a long-awaited hiatus, Bad Lip Reading has made a triumphant return, just in time for the NFL season.

The incident occurred just before 10 p.m. and fortunately, no injuries were reported. Upon inspection, bullet marks were found on the building's exterior wall, while shell casings were discovered in a nearby alleyway, McManus revealed. Though the building has been targeted in the past, this incident bears no immediate connection to the tragic events in Dallas. Chief McManus emphasized that the police force will not tolerate the endangerment of its officers, stating, "We are not going to allow our officers to be targets. This is not open season on police officers here in San Antonio or anywhere else. We're not going to allow that to happen." As the investigation continued into the night, the 300 block of South Santa Rosa, where the building is located, remained closed off. Numerous police vehicles were stationed at a nearby intersection to restrict entry into the area.”Xß   Obama's Secret Letters to Iran  In a recently revealed secret, it has come to light that former President Obama sent not one, not two, not even three, but four secret letters to the leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei. While it is no secret that Obama holds Muslims and individuals from the Middle East in high regard, the existence of these letters adds another layer to the complex relationship between the United States and Iran.  According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, those who were briefed on the correspondence stated that the most recent letter, sent in mid-October, emphasized to Khamenei that any cooperation on the Islamic State was contingent on Iran reaching a comprehensive agreement with global powers on the future of Tehran's nuclear program by the November 24 diplomatic deadline. However, when questioned about these secret letters, White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to confirm their existence, stating that he is not in a position to discuss the private correspondence of the president.  Despite the secrecy surrounding these letters, the White House did confirm that Obama had sent a letter to the leader of Iran regarding the country's nuclear program. Senator Mark Kirk (R-Illinois) expressed his concern over the secret correspondence, suggesting that America's strongest move to prevent a nuclear Iran lies in passing the Menendez-Kirk legislation, which aims to increase sanctions on Iran if it fails to agree to a deal.  Critics, such as Lt. Col Ralph Peters, have accused Obama of being more comfortable engaging in secret relations with Iranians than being honest with the American people. Furthermore, they argue that this letter could be seen as a betrayal by America's Middle Eastern allies, playing into the hands of ISIS.  It is important to note that the article includes several derogatory and inflammatory statements towards Obama and Muslims, which have been excluded from this rewrite. Such language does not align with the standards of The New York Times.”Xf	  [Watch] MRCTV's Dan Joseph Asks Protesters If "Hands Up, Don't Shoot" Was Real  Grab an adult beverage, because this one is quite a story. Unfortunately, there seems to be an error preventing the video from playing. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and encourage you to report this bug so it can be promptly addressed.  It is important to note that the individuals interviewed in this video may lack knowledge of forensic evidence and its application. Nevertheless, it is crucial to remember that these individuals have the right to vote and their opinions matter.  Additionally, it is worth mentioning a viewpoint expressed here regarding the Democratic Party allegedly securing votes through welfare. This claim might be seen as hypocritical in light of the "hands up, don't shoot" slogan associated with the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite the evidence and facts surrounding specific cases, some people are protesting against law enforcement, arguing that black lives matter. However, they fail to acknowledge that these police officers bravely enter dangerous neighborhoods daily, risking their own safety to protect black lives. Instead of targeting the police, those who advocate for the value of black lives should consider directing their protests towards the very neighborhoods where police officers patrol.  While the focus is often on police actions, it is important to recognize the alarming rise in black-on-black crime during the Obama administration. If one truly cares about the lives of young black individuals, it is vital to engage with the communities where this violence occurs daily. Rather than showing defiance towards law enforcement, individuals should be addressing the root causes of this problem and protesting in these neglected neighborhoods where black lives seemingly do not matter.  In fact, those who believe in the importance of black lives should be writing to their elected officials, demanding answers as to why the issue of black-on-black murder remains unaddressed. Prominent figures such as Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan, Jesse Jackson, Eric Holder, and Barack Obama have seemingly turned a blind eye to the tragic reality of young black men killing each other. It begs the question of who truly values black lives.  Note: The New York Times would not typically use offensive language or derogatory terms, so those have been omitted from this rewrite.”•|     Xž
  $775 Million in Paid Leave: The Consequences of Subsidization  In recent years, the effects of subsidization have become increasingly apparent in various sectors of the economy. A prime example of this can be seen in the corn industry, where subsidies aimed at promoting the production of ethanol led to a surplus of corn. As a result, corn prices plummeted, leaving farmers in financial distress. This illustrates the adage that what you subsidize, you get more of. By diverting land and resources to corn production, other crops suffered, causing artificial inflation in the prices of other goods.  Another sector affected by subsidization is the housing market. The collapse of housing prices during the 2007-2009 financial crisis can be traced back to the actions of Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac. These institutions, incentivized or forced to offer loans to individuals who would not have normally qualified, created an inflated market. The result was a surge in housing prices that could not be sustained, leading to a subsequent crash and the exposure of poorly qualified borrowers. Once again, what you subsidize, you get more of.  The impact of subsidization is not limited to the economy alone. The decline in poverty rates in the United States experienced a setback in 1969 and hit rock bottom in 1973. This coincided with President Johnson's introduction of the War on Poverty, which aimed to subsidize low-income earners. The unintended consequence was an increase in poverty rates. This serves as a stark reminder that subsidizing poverty only perpetuates its existence.  A recent report by The Washington Post revealed that there are currently 57,000 government employees on administrative or otherwise justified leave, costing taxpayers a staggering $775 million. This raises important questions about the wisdom of subsidizing such practices. If these employees are on leave due to disciplinary issues, why are they still receiving pay? It seems that by subsidizing sub-standard performance, immorality, and insubordination, we are inadvertently encouraging more of these behaviors.  Auditors discovered that supervisors possess wide discretion in placing employees on leave, often for alleged violations of government rules and laws, whistleblowing, doubts about trustworthiness, or disputes with colleagues or superiors. Some employees remain on paid leave while they challenge demotions and other forms of punishment. This raises concerns about the misuse of taxpayer funds and the perpetuation of a system that rewards poor performance.  It is essential to recognize the unintended consequences of subsidization. Whether it is the corn industry, the housing market, or even government employees, the ad”X,
  Carson Criticizes Political Attacks and Alleges Communist Influence  In his bid for the presidency, Dr. Ben Carson has emerged as a vocal critic of what he perceives as a creeping communist influence within the United States. Despite lacking political experience, Carson asserts that he possesses a deep understanding of the communist threat facing the nation.  Carson has been particularly critical of President Obama, accusing his administration of embracing communist ideals during his two terms in office. He points to Obama's ability to achieve his desired outcomes and his use of executive power as evidence of a communist regime. Carson also highlights Obama's rejection of the XLPipeline Deal and his emphasis on combating climate change as further proof of his communist leanings, arguing that these policies have resulted in a lack of job opportunities.  Furthermore, Carson alleges that Obama has abused his position of power and disregarded America's freedom and democracy. He claims that Obama acts solely according to his own will, rather than adhering to constitutional principles and the desires of the American people. Carson has even suggested that America would resemble Cuba if it weren't for the influence of the Lord and Fox News, which he credits with preventing the nation from becoming a totalitarian state.  Carson's admiration for W. Cleon Skousen, an author who has written extensively on the progressive plan, is well-known. Skousen's book, "The Naked Communist," is endorsed by Carson on its front cover. According to Skousen, communism is defined as a government system where the state owns and controls the means of production and transportation. Carson points to various government agencies, such as Obamacare, EPA, IRS, government banks, national parks, and TSA, as evidence of the government's increasing control over citizens' lives.  Carson believes that there is a hidden enemy within the country that manipulates American citizens. He asserts that this enemy consists of political elites who condescend towards average citizens and impose their values and beliefs on the nation. If elected president, Carson promises to lead a government that operates according to the will of the people, rather than succumbing to a communist agenda.  Carson's message resonates with those who are concerned about the encroachment of government power and its potential impact on individual freedoms. By remaining vigilant and aware of negative government forces, Carson believes that the American people can take steps to prevent the country from succumbing to a communist society.”XJ	  Title: Black Lives Matter Faces Criticism for Reaction to Tragic Police Deaths  In a shocking turn of events, members of the Black Lives Matter movement were observed celebrating the deaths of 11 police officers in Dallas, Texas. This radical group, often compared to the Black Panthers and the Black Caucus in Washington D.C., has now faced severe backlash for their actions, with some arguing that they have crossed a line that even these controversial organizations have not.  It is difficult to comprehend how anyone could find joy in the loss of innocent lives, particularly those who were serving to protect their communities. By publicly expressing their delight at this tragedy, members of Black Lives Matter have transformed a somber event into a cause for celebration. This brazen display of arrogance and disregard for human life is deeply troubling.  What is truly bewildering is the fact that these individuals simultaneously rely on law enforcement to come to their aid in times of need. It is an unmistakable hypocrisy to call for help from the very men and women they claim to despise. Such contradictory behavior only serves to undermine the credibility of their cause and further alienate those they seek to influence.  One cannot find adequate words to describe the individuals who view the deaths of police officers as a reason for jubilation. This sentiment goes against the very essence of being American, as it disrespects the fundamental values on which our nation was built. It is an affront to the principles of justice, equality, and unity that countless individuals have fought and died to uphold.  Among the comments posted by Black Lives Matter supporters, one particularly striking remark suggests that these individuals should experience life in a country like Iran, where true oppression exists. Perhaps then, they would quickly reassess their perspective on the United States, a nation that, despite its flaws, has provided countless opportunities and freedoms to its citizens.  The behavior exhibited by some members of Black Lives Matter following the tragic events in Dallas is not representative of the movement as a whole. Nevertheless, it is crucial to address and condemn these actions so as not to overshadow the important conversations surrounding police reform, racial equality, and social justice that the movement seeks to initiate.”X
  Opinion | The Suspicious Circumstances Surrounding the Immigration Crisis  In recent months, the influx of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has sparked a heated debate across the nation. The official narrative suggests that these children are fleeing poverty, hunger, and disease, seeking a better life in the United States. However, upon closer examination, a more disturbing reality emerges.  One must question the notion that over 100,000 parents willingly handed their children over to human traffickers. It seems implausible that all these parents, facing financial constraints themselves, could afford the hefty fees demanded by these criminals. So, who is financing the transportation of these children? Who is paying the smugglers to guide them across Mexico?  It is crucial that we shed light on the funding behind this operation. The American public deserves to know if their hard-earned tax dollars are being used to facilitate the activities of cartels. A thorough audit of our resources, as proposed by Trey Gowdy, would illuminate the truth. As long as the IRS holds the necessary records, we should be able to uncover the source of these payments.  Let us try to understand the predicament these parents faced. It is inconceivable that they would allow their young children to embark on a perilous journey across an entire country, especially in the hands of human smugglers they have never met. The costs of food, water, and shelter along the way would be astronomical. How could impoverished parents possibly afford such expenses?  The answer lies in the fact that these parents must have been assured of payment on the other end. These child traffickers do not release their captives until they receive their due compensation. We have witnessed countless instances of families held captive in homes across the country, where their well-being is secondary to the pursuit of monetary gain. It is clear that these children are not being handed over at the border out of genuine concern for their welfare.  Yet, despite these disturbing realities, we are expected to believe that this influx of minors is an act of kindness. We are told that these children are desperate, fleeing unimaginable hardships. However, upon closer inspection, their appearances do not align with the narrative. Photographs depict these children dressed in new clothes, equipped with cell phones. It is difficult to reconcile these images with the notion of abject poverty.  Lawmakers must not mistake our kindness for weakness. While we genuinely care about the well-being of these children, we also have millions of our own children who are hungry and suffering. As we read our papers and eat our meals,”XÐ   Headline: Tragedy Strikes Crowley, Texas: Murder-Suicide Claims Four Lives  Byline: [Author Name]  CROWLEY, Texas - A harrowing incident unfolded on Sunday afternoon in this quiet town, located an hour outside of Dallas. Police officers rushed to the scene after receiving a distressing 911 call. The caller, a woman, informed the authorities that her nine-year-old relative had reached out for help, revealing a gruesome discovery: his sisters, their mother, and her boyfriend were found dead inside the residence.  Initial investigations indicate that 36-year-old Samuel Morales, the boyfriend, committed the heinous act. He allegedly shot his 34-year-old girlfriend, Xiomara Leon, and her 18-year-old daughter, Linda Gonzalez. Tragically, Leon's 13-year-old daughter, Yasmine Zavala, appeared to have been strangled. Morales, it seems, turned the gun on himself, leaving a trail of devastation in his wake.  At a press conference held on Sunday, Police Chief Luis Soler acknowledged the difficulty in ascertaining the precise events that unfolded. "We don't know exactly what happened out there," Chief Soler stated, highlighting the ongoing investigation into the tragedy. The nine-year-old boy, who courageously reached out for help, was fortunately not present during the incident. After a brief period under the care of Child Protective Services, he has been placed with relatives who will provide him with a supportive environment during this trying time.  The victims of this heart-wrenching incident are pictured above: Samuel Morales, Xiomara Leon, and Linda Gonzalez. Below, we remember Yasmine Zavala, whose young life was tragically cut short.  As the community grapples with this profound loss, questions remain unanswered. The motive behind this act of violence continues to elude investigators, leaving loved ones and neighbors searching for solace and understanding. The Crowley community must now rally together, offering support to those affected by this incomprehensible tragedy.”Xu  CNN Contributor Expresses Frustration Over Israel's Iron Dome Rendering Hamas Rockets Ineffective  In a recent CNN segment, esteemed contributor Gary voiced his discontent with the Israeli missile defense system, known as the Iron Dome, which has proven highly successful in intercepting rockets launched by Hamas militants. In his impassioned remarks, Gary implored a fellow commentator to emerge from his sheltered perspective and acknowledge the relentless attacks Israel has endured from its neighboring adversaries.  Gary's frustration stemmed from the fact that even during periods of agreed-upon ceasefires, Hamas continued its assault on Israeli civilians, leaving no room for respite. Contemplating the audacity and lack of courage displayed by Hamas, he questioned whether the organization's actions could be deemed brave, considering its propensity for indiscriminately targeting innocent lives.  Given these circumstances, Gary posed the question: should Israel simply stand idly by and allow such aggression to persist? From his perspective, Israel's remarkable display of restraint, opting to refrain from leveling Hamas-controlled territories, deserves commendation. Despite the constant provocation, Israel has exhibited remarkable self-control, choosing instead to employ defensive measures rather than initiating a full-scale military operation.  Gary's impassioned plea exemplified the ongoing discussions surrounding Israel's response to Hamas aggression. As the conflict persists, voices such as his contribute to the broader conversation surrounding the delicate balance between self-defense and the pursuit of peace in the region.”Xù  American Murdered on Caribbean Beach with Cutlass: A Tragic Tale of Romance Gone Wrong  In a heart-wrenching turn of events, a romantic beach walk ended in tragedy for an American couple vacationing in the Caribbean. The 39-year-old woman and her husband were enjoying their stay at a resort in Grenada when they decided to take a leisurely stroll along the shoreline. Little did they know, their idyllic moment would soon be shattered.  On a deserted stretch of beach, the couple found themselves confronted by a man armed with a cutlass, a type of sword for those unfamiliar with the weapon. Reminiscent of scenes straight out of Pirates of the Caribbean, the assailant mercilessly attacked the woman, fatally running her through with the blade. Miraculously, her husband managed to escape and promptly sought help from the authorities.  The attacker, identified as ex-convict David Martin Benjamin, later turned himself in to the police. Shockingly, it was revealed that Benjamin had recently been released from prison, raising questions about the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. The lifeless body of the victim was later discovered near the water, further emphasizing the gruesome nature of the crime.  Witnesses described the beach where the incident occurred as completely deserted, leaving victims vulnerable to such unforeseen attacks. Journalist Sue Hardy expressed her concerns, stating, "No one can see you there but of course nobody can see if anyone attacks you there. I wouldn't venture onto that other, hidden beach again."  The couple, whose identities have not been disclosed, were guests at La Sagesse, a resort situated southeast of St. Georges, the capital of Grenada. This tragic incident is undoubtedly one that Grenadian officials would have preferred to keep under wraps. While warning tourists about the dangers of sunburn is one thing, having to caution against encounters with cutlass-wielding ex-convicts is an entirely different matter.  As authorities continue their investigation, this horrifying incident serves as a chilling reminder of the need for increased safety measures in popular tourist destinations. The allure of pristine beaches and picturesque landscapes should not overshadow the importance of ensuring visitors' security and well-being.”Xâ	  State Department Creates New Office to Handle Hillary Clinton's Emails  In response to the overwhelming administrative burden caused by Hillary Clinton's use of a private email address during her time as secretary of state, the State Department has established a special office dedicated to sorting through and redacting the tens of thousands of emails provided by the Clinton camp. This move, which involves relocating 50 workers, both current employees and new hires, aims to fulfill the numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests that have accumulated over the years.   The need for this new office highlights the consequences of Clinton's decision to use a private email address for official communications, as well as a judge's ruling in a FOIA lawsuit that these emails be released. Clinton herself recently acknowledged her mistake, stating in an interview with ABC News, "That was a mistake. I'm sorry about that." However, this apology does not change the fact that the decision has resulted in significant financial costs for the government and taxpayers.  The State Department, in an attempt to address the situation, has hired additional staff to assist with the monthly court-ordered release of Clinton's emails. These employees, numbering around 20 permanent workers and 30 part-time workers, will be temporarily replaced by the newly appointed staff, who may also handle other FOIA requests related to Clinton.  It is worth noting that this new office is not exclusively dedicated to Clinton's emails or the court-ordered releases. Instead, it will also assist in addressing the backlog of FOIA requests that have accumulated over time. The State Department asserts that this move aims to improve overall efficiency in handling such requests.  This announcement coincides with Secretary of State John Kerry's appointment of Ambassador Janice Jacobs as the transparency coordinator. It is important to note that Jacobs has previously made donations to Clinton's campaign. While Kerry's efforts to address the backlog of FOIA requests are commendable, questions remain about the true transparency of these actions.  Ultimately, the establishment of this new office is a response to the significant challenges caused by Clinton's decision to use a private email address. The State Department is taking steps to rectify the situation, albeit at a considerable cost. The hope is that this initiative will alleviate the burden on the department and help restore transparency to the handling of government emails.”Xv  America Needs a Wake-Up Call  In recent years, there has been a growing demand for free college education, complaints about sexist air conditioning, and concerns over Planned Parenthood allegedly selling aborted baby parts. These issues highlight a troubling lack of personal responsibility within American culture. What is it about our society that places more value on human life than the life of a lion? When will we realize that the middle-class will suffer under higher taxes meant to fund free college education? When will we stop associating derogatory titles with our flag in the name of progress and leave it as a symbol of unity?   We often find ourselves comparing our liberties to those of other countries. Gun control, for instance, is lauded in Australia, but few mention the 40% rise in overall assaults, with knife attacks alone increasing by 11%. Similarly, the left admires the European economy, yet Germany struggles due to Greece's failing economy. Even China has experienced negative consequences from the adoption of democratic socialist economic policies from across the Atlantic.   The rise of Islamic jihad poses a global fear, yet we are taught that avoiding offense is more important than speaking out. However, the countless lone wolf Islamic attacks in the UK and France suggest otherwise. Even Australia has faced the threat of Islamic terrorism with an attack on a cafÃ©. It seems that we are more inclined to consider our enemies as friends while neglecting our allies. Chants like "Death to America" are interpreted as peace talks by this administration.   Defending the rights of unborn children is seen as a loss of our moral compass. The progressive agenda contradicts itself, and those who adhere to its teachings find themselves in a similar predicament. Before we allow voters to dismantle the rights that our founders fought for, we must confront the reality of a world without life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is crucial that we reassess our priorities and consider the potential consequences of our actions.

According to authorities, Rubelin allegedly swiped his friend's winning Powerball ticket, worth $50,000, and attempted to pass it off as his own.  Rubelin's friend, Victor Castillo, did not win the staggering $1.5 billion jackpot that captivated the nation two weeks ago, but he did secure a significant sum that would have provided some financial relief. However, as Castillo was reading the winning numbers to his friends, Rubelin snatched the ticket from his grasp. Castillo, who considered Rubelin to be like a brother, was left shocked and betrayed. "He was my friend, but he is no longer," Castillo said through an interpreter. "We were like brothers. He betrayed me. I'm still in shock."  The incident took place on January 14, the day after the historic Powerball drawing, at a Bronx diner where Rubelin, Castillo, and other cab drivers had gathered to check their tickets. Fortunately, the entire incident was captured on video, which was subsequently shared with the authorities. Wagner Cruceta, the manager of La Fuerza, the Bronx bodega where the winning ticket was purchased, confirmed the events. "Victor bought the ticket. The other guy came to check it but left. It was not nice," Cruceta stated.  Following the incident, Castillo attempted to locate Rubelin at his mother's house, where he had been staying. Eventually, Rubelin was apprehended on Tuesday and charged with grand larceny. Family members revealed that Rubelin was struggling financially, falling behind on rent for an apartment in Washington Heights where his children live with their mother and grandmother. "We've been waiting on him to pay the rent we owe," said Segunda Paduani, the children's grandmother. "If he would have had the money, he would have paid it. He's always helped with the rent."  Rubelin now faces not only the consequences of his alleged crime but also the financial burden of court costs. It is a harsh lesson in the perils of greed, as Forrest Gump's mother would say, "Stupid is as stupid does."  Source: NY Daily News”Xb
  Undocumented Immigrants Exhibit Troubling Criminal Histories, Report Finds  In a recent report, it has come to light that a significant number of undocumented immigrants in the United States possess criminal records, raising concerns regarding public safety. The findings, detailed by a reputable non-profit organization, shed new light on the complex issue of immigration enforcement and its potential ramifications.  The report, carried out by the Institute for Crime and Justice, revealed a disturbing trend among undocumented individuals residing in the country. Contrary to popular perception, a substantial portion of these immigrants have been involved in criminal activities, further fueling the ongoing debate surrounding immigration policies.  Though the report does not provide an exact figure, it indicates that a notable percentage of undocumented immigrants possess criminal records, encompassing a range of offenses. These crimes include but are not limited to theft, drug-related offenses, and instances of violent behavior. The revelation underscores the necessity for a comprehensive approach to immigration reform that addresses public safety concerns.  While critics argue that this data reinforces the notion that undocumented immigrants pose a threat to society, advocates for immigration reform emphasize the importance of distinguishing between individual cases and generalizations. They contend that broad-brushing an entire community based on the actions of a few individuals neglects the contributions and positive attributes that many undocumented immigrants bring to the country.  The report's findings have reignited the contentious debate surrounding immigration policy, with politicians and activists calling for stricter enforcement measures. Advocates for tighter borders argue that these revelations substantiate the need for increased scrutiny and vetting of immigrants seeking to enter the country.  In response, proponents of immigration reform argue that this data should not overshadow the need for a more compassionate and comprehensive approach towards addressing the concerns of undocumented immigrants. They stress the importance of focusing on rehabilitation and integration rather than solely relying on punitive measures.  The report serves as a reminder that the issue of immigration remains multifaceted and complex, requiring nuanced discussions and evidence-based policymaking. As lawmakers and advocates grapple with these findings, it is crucial to maintain a balanced perspective that considers both public safety and the well-being of undocumented individuals seeking a better life in the United States.”X›	  Title: Trump Warns of Potential Lawsuits and Legal Challenges if Ted Cruz Becomes GOP Nominee  In a recent campaign rally in Janesville, WI, Donald Trump expressed concern over the eligibility of his rival, Ted Cruz, to become the Republican nominee for president. While the liberal media has largely remained silent on this issue, Trump believes it is a crucial matter that will eventually be exploited by the Democrats to undermine Cruz's candidacy.  Trump refrained from outright denying Cruz's American citizenship, but he did question his natural born status and viability as a presidential nominee. The billionaire businessman predicted that if, by some fluke, Cruz were to secure the nomination, the Democrats would immediately file lawsuits against him.  Cruz's Canadian birthplace became the focal point of Trump's discussion on eminent domain and its application in the proposed Keystone Pipeline, which would have connected Canada to Texas, where Cruz serves as a senator. Trump urged the audience to consider his track record of accurate predictions and emphasized that the Democrats would undoubtedly challenge Cruz's eligibility.  The real estate tycoon argued that Cruz's birth in Canada, along with his four-year residency and Canadian citizenship, would cast doubts on his natural born status as required by the Constitution. Trump expressed his belief that the Democrats had a legitimate case against Cruz, asserting that he was not born on American soil.  Furthermore, Trump warned that if Cruz were to miraculously secure the nomination, it would be a futile endeavor. The Republican frontrunner predicted that Cruz would face legal repercussions, likely resulting in his loss. Trump emphasized the potentially problematic consequences of having a nominee embroiled in a lawsuit, especially one involving questions of eligibility.  While Trump's claims may seem speculative, it is worth noting that there is no concrete evidence to support Cruz's acquisition of United States citizenship. This lack of proof may further exacerbate the legal challenges that could arise if Cruz were to become the GOP nominee.  As the presidential race intensifies, the issue of Ted Cruz's eligibility is likely to garner more attention. With Trump leading the charge against him, the Texas senator will undoubtedly face scrutiny from both his Republican rivals and the Democrats. Only time will tell how this issue will ultimately impact the 2016 election.”Xp	  Headline: Jewish Student Stabbed in Brooklyn Synagogue by Man with Troubled Past  Byline: [Author's Name]  In a shocking incident that unfolded on Tuesday, chaos erupted at a Brooklyn synagogue when Calvin Peters, a 49-year-old man, attacked and stabbed a young student who was peacefully engaged in prayer. Disturbing video footage captured the arrival of police officers at the scene, their subsequent confrontation with the assailant, and finally, the use of force to subdue him. The victim, identified as Levi Rosenblat, a 22-year-old student, sustained a stab wound to his head near the left temple and was immediately rushed to King County Hospital in Brooklyn. Medical professionals have reported that Rosenblat's condition is currently stable.  During a brief news conference, Officer John Miller of the New York Police Department (NYPD) described the incident as an isolated event. He further noted that the assailant, Peters, has a documented history of emotional disturbances and similar outbursts in various locations. Peters, who has been arrested 19 times, has a record of psychological issues, according to law enforcement officials. Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton stated that the department's hate crimes unit is investigating the incident, although there is currently no evidence to suggest a hate crime.  The swift response by the NYPD to this tense and dangerous situation is commendable. While any loss of life is deeply tragic, it is fortunate that due to the prompt actions of our officers, more individuals were not harmed. Commissioner Bratton emphasized that the suspect posed a clear danger to society and affirmed that the police response was appropriate. Many are now questioning why Peters, with his extensive history of criminal behavior and psychological problems, was not incarcerated or received the necessary intervention earlier.  The incident has left members of the Brooklyn community in shock and disbelief as they grapple with the aftermath of this senseless act of violence. As the investigation continues, authorities and community leaders are working together to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents, particularly those within the Jewish community.

A significant amount of money is circulating in the human trafficking industry, but no one seems to be taking responsibility for it. Ana Garcia de Hernandez, the First Lady of Honduras, recently visited the United States border and toured several facilities where her fellow citizens were being held and processed after illegally crossing into the country. During her visit, she appeared alongside Texas Representative Henry Cuellar and addressed the media. Two of her comments caught our attention, and you can watch the video below to see the report.  One of the comments that grabbed our attention was her mention of the exorbitant amounts of money being paid to human traffickers who smuggle children across Mexico and into the United States. According to Action Four News in McAllen, Texas, the fee charged by these smugglers to transport children from Honduras ranges from $5,000 to $25,000 per child. Rep. Cuellar and Ms. Hernandez, as reported, emphasized that these coyotes, or smugglers, are amassing great wealth. The alleged reason behind the surge in illegal alien children entering the United States is the poverty, violence, and desperation that lead them to make this dangerous decision. The average per capita income in Honduras is $183 per month, which amounts to less than $2,200 per year to support a family. Even if both parents work, $4,400 falls short of the lowest smuggling fee of $5,000 for a single child. Many children arrive with a parent or sibling, further increasing the expenses. This is the starting point, before considering costs such as rent, food, utilities, and other daily living expenses that must be deducted from a meager family budget. Many Hondurans, especially those most desperate to come to America, earn even less than this. How, then, were they able to save up the equivalent of over a year's worth of pay per child in a country where 61.5% of the population lives below the poverty line and where disposable income is primarily spent on essential items? It seems they simply don't have the means. Someone else must be financing their journey. Could it be that they have a wealthy benefactor named Sam?  In June, Vice President Joe Biden met with officials from the three main offender nations - Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador - and promised that the United States would provide financial aid to these governments to discourage their citizens from migrating.

  Title: Examining Cultural Conditioning and the Symbolism of Rainbows  In a thought-provoking video, AlfonZo Rachel, a renowned commentator on PJ Media, delves into the intersection of religion, rainbows, and cultural conditioning. As an avid consumer of Rachel's content, this writer has come to appreciate his ability to articulate ideas that resonate with many. Today's analysis is particularly intriguing, not only because Rachel highlights the biblical significance of rainbows but also because he addresses the Confederate Battle Flag's softened image and its impact on society.  Rachel's commentary on the biblical origins of rainbows is captivating, as he underscores how this symbol has been co-opted by the gay movement. He draws attention to the biblical tale of the flood, wherein God destroys the world due to the spread of a "homosexual lifestyle" in Sodom and Gomorrah. Paradoxically, God then presents the rainbow as a sign that such a cataclysmic event will never recur. Rachel astutely observes the unexpected turnabout in the LGBTQ+ community's adoption of this symbol, given its original context.  The video also addresses cultural conditioning through popular entertainment. Rachel contends that conservatives and Christians have passively allowed the erosion of traditional values without offering a compelling alternative. He asserts that if we aim to effect positive change in society, traditionalists must present an appealing alternative to the prevailing cultural narrative. This key takeaway, unfortunately, often gets lost amidst the heated discourse.  While Rachel's argument regarding homosexuality and love in Scripture may be seen as provocative, he emphasizes that homosexuality itself is not condemned, but rather the act. He suggests that humans possess free will and, with the love of God, can exercise self-control. However, Rachel's assertion fails to acknowledge that heterosexual individuals also struggle with self-control.  In terms of hypocrisy, Rachel advocates for respecting the privacy of individuals' intimate lives, urging those who oppose the LGBTQ+ community's practices to refrain from imposing their own beliefs on others. Conversely, he suggests that the erasure of faith from the public sphere was the primary objective for some, calling for mutual respect among different belief systems.  Ultimately, Rachel's video serves as a reminder of the importance of critically examining cultural conditioning and the symbols that permeate our society. To foster positive change, traditionalists must present an enticing alternative to the prevailing narrative.”X²  John Bolton Discusses Obama's Handling of Russian Nuclear Missile Violations  In a recent interview with Greta Van Susteren, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton delved into the ongoing Russian situation, shedding light on the latest revelation that Russia has violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Bolton, known for his conservative views, asserted that the Russians have long been suspected of breaching the treaty, but the Obama administration chose not to address the issue for political gain.  Bolton argued that the Obama regime's decision to acknowledge the violations only came about due to the fear of a potential leak, which would further expose their ineptitude and submissiveness. The former ambassador further claimed to possess knowledge regarding other treaty violations, including probable chemical weapons violations.  Russia's actions in Syria have raised concerns about their compliance with not only the INF Treaty but also the Iranian nuclear deal. Bolton emphasized that these actions have opened up a debate on Russia's commitment to international agreements.  Regarding the U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia, Bolton criticized them as marginal increases that may inadvertently reinforce Russian President Vladimir Putin's belief that he can act with impunity in Ukraine. He argued that the imposition of new sanctions, in this case, might have been worse than no new sanctions at all.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, has also expressed his concerns about the various threats facing our nation, Constitution, and traditions.

  Title: Controversy Erupts as Bibles Distributed at Local Elementary School  Cloverleaf Elementary School faced a wave of criticism from parents after fifth-graders were given Bibles during a recent class activity. Jessica Greene, a concerned mother, expressed her outrage on social media, but her objections were met with a barrage of opposing views from the community.  Greene's son, Leo, came home with a Bible last Thursday, reporting that the school had distributed them in class. "We were in class," Leo recalled. "Our teacher mentioned that volunteers were handing out Bibles." Greene, taken aback by this development, attempted to reach out to the superintendent, but her calls went unanswered.  The school's decision to engage in this Bible distribution program sparked a heated debate among parents, leading to the disabling of the public post and subsequent deletion of comments on social media. A few remarks managed to be captured before the post was taken down, exemplifying the division of opinions within the community.  Some comments defended the school's initiative, questioning Greene's objections. "You're outnumbered here, and I stand by Cloverleaf," read one comment. "What are they afraid of? Apparently just Christians," it continued. This sentiment was accompanied by accusations of religious bias, claiming that the school system is more tolerant of other faiths, including radical Muslim extremists.  Despite the clash of viewpoints, the conversation became increasingly hostile, delving into personal attacks. "So, you're a normal atheist. I've no problem with that," one commenter stated. "I do have a problem with the Neurotic Control Freak ones though, like FFRF." Inflammatory language and derogatory remarks were exchanged, further intensifying the dispute.  Amidst the turmoil, the issue of constitutional rights was raised, with commenters debating the interpretation of the First Amendment. Some argued that the amendment only applies to Congress and not to state governments, local governments, or school boards. Additionally, reference was made to a previous legal battle in Ohio, where the state successfully defended the inclusion of a Bible verse in its motto.  While tensions ran high, it is essential to note that the debate revolved around differing beliefs and interpretations of the First Amendment. The right to freedom of religion and expression lies at the core of this controversy, highlighting the ongoing struggle to strike a balance between accommodating diverse perspectives and upholding the principles upon which our nation was founded.  As the dispute continues, it is clear that this issue has stirred deeply held convictions and ignited a passionate discourse within the community.”X‘  Despite Hillary Clinton's Teflon exterior, the FBI is now investigating further crimes related to her use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State. While many Americans who value justice still believe that Clinton will evade any consequences from the Department of Justice probe into her email irregularities, the sheer number of classified emails that passed through an unsecure server, some even with the highest classification rating, could be considered treasonous. However, given Clinton's history, it is unlikely that she will end up behind bars.  Recent reports indicate that the FBI has expanded its investigation into the server issue and the charges of gross negligence. The Bureau has requested documents from individuals involved in the scandal as well as from other parts of the Congressional investigation, a step not previously taken by the Justice Department. Fox News has provided details on the specific legal code that the FBI is examining: U.S. Code 18, Section 1001. This code addresses materially false statements made in writing, orally, or through a third party, as well as pressuring a third party to participate in a cover-up. Each felony violation carries a potential sentence of five years in prison. This particular section of the criminal code can be applied when an individual provides misleading or false statements that cause federal agents to expend additional resources and time. Legal experts and a former FBI agent have suggested that Section 1001 could apply if Clinton, her aides, or her attorney were not forthcoming with the FBI regarding her emails, their classification, and whether only non-government records were destroyed.  While it is unlikely that Clinton will face jail time, it is at least reassuring that the FBI is not simply abandoning this investigation. The initial focus of the investigation was the Special Committee on Benghazi, which sought to uncover who knew what and when, whether a stand-down order was given, and more. Little did we know that this was just the beginning, and the iceberg of Clinton's wrongdoing runs much deeper. We should be cautious, however, in comparing Clinton to the Titanic. Perhaps.”X’  Trump's Media Manipulation: A Masterful Move?  In a stunning turn of events, Donald Trump has once again managed to captivate the media's attention. On Friday the 13th, an audio tape of an interview between reporter Sue Carswell and a man claiming to be Trump's spokesman, John Miller, was leaked to the Washington Post. The conversation revolved around Trump's personal life and his divorce from his first wife. Many have pointed out that the voice on the tape bears a striking resemblance to a young Trump himself, leading to speculation that he was pretending to be someone else.  When confronted about the tape, Trump denied any involvement. This denial has sparked a frenzy among the media, with the central question being: Did Trump lie? After all, he had previously admitted, under oath, to making prank calls in the past. The fact that Trump, a potential future president, would lie about pretending to be someone else has raised eyebrows.  Another aspect of this story that has piqued interest is the source of the tape. Carswell, who appeared on Fox with Megyn Kelly, put forth a theory that Trump may have orchestrated the leak himself. Was he playing a clever game, ensuring that his name would dominate headlines for days? Or was he perhaps taking a swipe at the Washington Post, who received the tape after its owner, Jeff Bezos, unleashed a team of reporters to dig up dirt on Trump?  The truth behind these questions may remain a mystery, but one thing is for certain: Trump's ability to manipulate the media is truly remarkable. As we move forward into the rest of 2016, it seems that we can expect more surprises and twists from the ever-entertaining Donald Trump.”XÃ  Castro Manhandles Obama in Cuban Press Conference  The recent series of missteps and misstatements during President Obama's visit to Cuba may seem like typical political blunders, but they reveal a deeper issue. From the moment of his arrival, it was clear that the Cuban government did not assign anyone to greet the visiting American president at the airport, a basic protocol in welcoming a guest. This lack of courtesy suggests a possible underlying animosity towards Obama, similar to the strained relationship between the Castro brothers and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Perhaps the Castros simply cannot stand Obama, a sentiment shared by a majority of Americans. This unexpected common ground could be seen as a small step towards diplomatic progress.  At the conclusion of the press conference, it was apparent that Raul Castro wanted to avoid physical contact with Obama, perhaps due to the Cuban leader's knowledge of Obama's liberal views and reputation. Obama's outstretched arm remained stationary as Castro's hand grabbed his wrist, making it clear who held the power in this situation. Obama, displaying his characteristic submissive nature, smiled throughout the encounter, seemingly unaware of the negative optics. It is concerning that someone who represents our nation can appear so weak on the international stage. These embarrassing moments continue to accumulate, highlighting the challenges our nation, Constitution, and traditions face from various threats.  Rick Wells is a constitutional conservative writer who believes our nation is under attack. He does not shy away from speaking his mind and encourages readers to subscribe to his posts on his websites, RickWells.us and ConstitutionRising.com.”Xi
  Obama Administration Implements New Rule to Address Housing Discrimination  In a recent announcement, the Obama Administration revealed its plans to enforce a new rule aimed at combating housing discrimination. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has been discussing the 1968 Fair Housing Act for the past few years, but only recently have these discussions gained attention outside of conservative circles.  The Fair Housing Act was a landmark legislation that aimed to eliminate discrimination in real estate and mortgage practices. However, the way cities and towns across America have developed in terms of racial patterns since the act was passed has largely been voluntary. Many Americans have not been concerned about this issue, until now.  The Obama Administration's push for desegregation in suburbs and the perceived imposition of low-income housing on cities and towns has caused quite a stir. Megyn Kelly of FoxNews expressed her outrage during a recent exchange on the topic. However, amidst the chaos surrounding the Supreme Court's decisions in late June, one case in particular went under the radar. The case of Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. involved a non-profit community group suing a state over affordable housing grants and tax credits that had disparate impacts in one metropolitan region.  The issue at hand is the disproportionate representation of white individuals in suburbs due to the economic factors that drive middle and upper-middle class families to move away from cities. Consequently, suburban school districts have also been perceived as predominantly white. The Obama Administration, known for its focus on community organization, views this as a problem because neighborhoods and towns with higher economic status tend to have better resources such as schools, libraries, and parks. The administration believes that those who leave the cities and do not invest in poorer neighborhoods have a disparate impact, even if there is no intentional racial animosity.  To address this issue, the Obama Administration has introduced a new rule that requires cities and towns applying for federal funds to examine patterns of racial bias within their borders every 3-5 years. This rule, known as the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule, was put into place by HUD Secretary Julian Castro and spans 377 pages. It aims to address all concerns raised during the public comment period.  The Washington Post recently published an extensive article in support of this new rule, arguing that it is necessary to achieve racially integrated neighborhoods, something that has proven elusive in deeply segregated cities like Chicago and Baltimore. Civil rights groups have been demanding these rules, and they will now require cities and towns across the country to analyze their housing patterns for racial bias and publicly”X	  Trump Receives Endorsement from Boxing Promoter Don King in Fiery Speech  TOLEDO, Ohio â€” In a surprising turn of events, Donald Trump received a resounding endorsement from iconic boxing promoter Don King on Wednesday. Standing before a crowd of enthusiastic supporters, the white-haired King declared, "There's a revolution at hand."  Critics may question King's longstanding association with Trump, given their shared interests in hotel casinos and fight nights. However, this writer had the privilege of attending a fundraising event where King not only captivated the audience but also displayed his generosity through auction items. Despite his association with a controversial sport, King's character remains commendable.  It is important to note that this rally was organized by Republicans, not Democrats. The fervor and passion in the room were palpable, prompting frequent outbursts of "Amen" from the crowd. This movement, led by "We the People," is gaining momentum as a response to dashed hopes and unfulfilled promises of the past.  Americans have felt pushed to the margins, with women often bearing the brunt of this marginalization under the guise of achieving equality. King, known for his colorful language and unique vocabulary, boldly voiced these concerns. While his delivery may have been unconventional, the underlying ideas and sincerity were evident.  The restoration of the freedom that was once a cornerstone of this nation is the ultimate goal. The desire for this restoration resonates not only in America but also across the world. Though these rousing cheerleading sessions may seem trite and clichÃ©d, they serve a crucial purpose: to maintain the momentum needed to propel this movement into November.  It is clear that change is desired, not only by the people but also by those in power. The power of the vote can be harnessed to remind politicians who truly holds the reins. This movement is not confined to America; it is a force that is sweeping across the globe.  While some may be skeptical of Don King's endorsement, his passionate speech served to rally Trump supporters and ignite their enthusiasm. As this movement gains strength, it is important to remember that unity and determination are key to achieving the restoration of the promises once made to the American people.”Xø
  Declassified Bin Laden Documents Reveal Bizarre Job Application Questions  In a daring raid back in May 2011, U.S. Navy Seals successfully infiltrated Osama Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, killing the notorious terrorist leader and seizing a trove of valuable documents. Now, years later, some of these documents have been declassified and released to the public. Among them are letters to family members, observations on the situation in the Middle East, plans for attacks on Western targets, thoughts on Western countries, and what has been dubbed "Al Qaeda job applications."  The release of these documents, totaling 86 in number, by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence has garnered significant attention. One particular question on the job applications has captured the curiosity of many: the need for emergency contact information, in case the recruit were to carry out a suicide mission. As one Fox News commentator exclaimed, it appears that even Al Qaeda has its own HR department.  These correspondences shed light on Bin Laden's continued involvement in the organization from his hidden location, as he sought to direct operations. A letter written shortly before his death reveals his celebration of the Arab Spring revolutions, which had already toppled Tunisia's leader and were gaining momentum in other countries. Bin Laden wrote, "These are gigantic events that will eventually engulf most of the Muslim world, liberating it from American dominance. This troubles America, as its Secretary of State has expressed concern about armed Muslims controlling the region."  Beyond the intriguing aspect of Al Qaeda job applications and the revelation of Bin Laden's emphasis on family ties, his vendetta against the United States, and his desire to see destruction on Western soil, questions have arisen regarding the timing of the release of these documents. People on Capitol Hill and members of the media are beginning to wonder why this information is being made public now. While only the director of national intelligence knows the answer for certain, it is speculated that the innocuous nature of these documents prompted their release, in order to maintain awareness of the ongoing threat.  However, according to Steven Hayes at the Weekly Standard, there are still over a million documents yet to be released. The release of this current tranche was met with resistance from the CIA leadership and many within the Obama administration, but Congress mandated their declassification and public disclosure in the most recent intelligence authorization.  What remains hidden, according to Hayes' sources, are the truly intriguing aspects of Bin Laden's life, such as his relationship with Iran, intelligence information, and writings about the Taliban. As we eagerly await the release”X™
  UN Considering New Strategies to Increase Syrian Refugee Intake into the US  The current system allowing the United Nations, rather than the United States, to determine who receives asylum applications in the US is being criticized as misguided and dangerous. Many argue that Americans themselves should be the ones deciding who and how many individuals are allowed entry, through the actions of their own Congress. Presently, the UN has granted their agents the title of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a name that sounds regal and grand, but some believe would be more accurately described as a human trafficking and importation office. This title helps the UNHCR to create a false perception of legitimacy.  In their efforts to move as many individuals from the Middle East, including potential terrorists, to the US, the UNHCR is now exploring alternative methods to bypass the scrutiny of the American people. The UNHCR is struggling to meet the goals set by President Obama's plan to bring in 10,000 Syrian refugees by September, and even more in the future. At the current pace, it could take decades to establish a North American Caliphate. Consequently, the UN is devising a new strategy.  Senior Researcher Nayla Rush from the Center for Immigration Studies has warned that the UN is considering new methods of infiltration for the refugees, potentially by avoiding the refugee label altogether and inflating numbers in other programs. These alternative pathways may serve as convenient detours to bypass the strict scrutiny that the US refugee resettlement program is currently under. Rush believes that the UN is already laying the groundwork for this plan, in order to create a false appearance of legitimacy.  During a panel discussion at the Brookings Institution in February, Beth Harris, Research Professor at Georgetown University and advisor to the United Nations Secretary General, suggested the possibility of alternative paths specifically targeting the US. Rush points to comments made by the UNHCR, stating that refugees and government officials anticipate this crisis lasting 10 to 15 years. In response, the UNHCR plans to host a meeting next month to explore what they call "alternative safe pathways" for Syrian refugees. One proposal is to encourage universities to offer scholarships to Syrian students as a means of increasing the number of Syrians entering the US.  Critics argue that the UNHCR is overstepping its authority and abusing its power. They argue that the UN, as a foreign globalist entity, should not have any legitimate control over the US Constitution or the American people. The debate over who has the ultimate say in determining the fate of”XO   Jamie Lynn Spears, the beloved younger sister of pop star Britney Spears, found herself in the midst of an unexpected altercation during a recent outing to the popular Pita Pit in Hammond, Louisiana. What was meant to be a casual night out turned into a chaotic scene as a brawl erupted, leaving Spears and her friend in a perilous situation.  According to witnesses, Spears' friend was suddenly targeted by another customer, sparking a violent confrontation that quickly spiraled out of control. In a remarkable display of bravery, the 30-year-old actress and singer sprang into action, swiftly coming to her friend's aid. Without hesitation, Spears ushered her companion to safety, taking refuge behind the counter.   In an astonishing turn of events, Spears seized a large serrated knife, employing it as a means to defuse the escalating fight. Jack J. Brighenti, the owner of the Pita Pit where the incident occurred, expressed his astonishment, stating that in his many years of operating the establishment, he had never witnessed such a dramatic turn of events. "I have been with Pita Pit for several years, and have never seen anything like this before," Brighenti told E! News.  The incident transpired in the early hours of Saturday, just moments before closing time. A group of individuals engaged in a heated argument, triggering the unexpected intervention of Jamie Lynn Spears. Despite the alarming turn of events, her friend ultimately decided not to pursue legal action, and no arrests were made.  Spears' swift thinking and courageous actions undoubtedly played a crucial role in preventing the situation from escalating further. While the circumstances surrounding the altercation remain somewhat unclear, one thing is certain: Jamie Lynn Spears' quick reflexes and determination helped to restore order before things could spiral completely out of hand.”XH   Trump and Sessions to Meet with GOP Establishment in Unity Effort  Donald Trump has been touting himself as the candidate of unity, despite facing accusations of division from the media and political figures. However, with the backing of Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who has endorsed Trump for president, it seems that some members of the Republican establishment may now be open to giving him a chance to unite the party. Sessions, who has been working closely with Trump, arranged an off-the-record meeting between the candidate and a group of influential DC GOP establishment figures, including members of Congress. The meeting, which will focus on party unity, is a step towards bridging the gap between Trump and the establishment.   The involvement of Senator Sessions in organizing the meeting should alleviate concerns among Trump supporters that their interests are being betrayed, although it is always prudent to remain cautious. Sessions is a trustworthy and dedicated politician who shares Trump's vision for fixing America's problems and giving power back to the people. While compromises may need to be made, Trump recognizes that he cannot accomplish everything on his own and needs the help of others. By bringing the GOP establishment on board, Trump hopes to minimize internal conflicts and focus on the upcoming election.  Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, confirmed the meeting and expressed optimism about the positive response from Washington. The meeting will take place just before Trump's speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's policy conference in Washington.  In conclusion, Trump and Sessions are making efforts to unite the Republican Party by engaging with the GOP establishment. This meeting signifies a step towards party unity and a chance for Trump to showcase his managerial and negotiation skills.”XP
  Clinton Dirty Money Trail: $675,000 Donated to Wife of FBI Official Overseeing Investigation  The Obama Clinton corruption scandal continues to unravel, revealing deeply disturbing connections. An FBI official, who conveniently received a promotion during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's alleged criminal activities, has now been linked to a staggering $675,000 in cash and services funneled into his household through campaign donations to his wife. Curiously, his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, had not shown any serious interest in running for office until she was handpicked by the corrupt Governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, a close ally of the Clintons.  The donations to Dr. McCabe's campaign took the form of $467,500 in cash and an additional $207,788 worth of support, including campaign mailers. McAuliffe successfully convinced her to embark on an ultimately unsuccessful run for the Virginia State Senate in a private meeting. It is worth noting that Dr. McCabe met with McAuliffe only once before being persuaded to enter the race. Her husband, Andrew McCabe, has since been promoted to the position of deputy director of the FBI, and interestingly, had oversight of Clinton's case once he was promoted.  One can't help but wonder if McAuliffe or his representatives identified McCabe as a potential accomplice who could be easily swayed with promises of cash and political favors. In return, all he had to do was bury the Clinton investigation or comply with the decisions made by their compromised Director, James Comey.  Although a spokesman for Governor McAuliffe claimed that his support for Dr. McCabe was solely based on his belief that she would be a good state senator, it is difficult to buy into this narrative. This practice of supporting candidates who align with their agenda is supposedly customary for Virginia governors. However, it seems clear that this was merely a relatively clean method for funneling significant amounts of money to Dr. McCabe in exchange for political favors. This quid pro quo is a hallmark of the Clinton circle of corruption.  The excuses put forth by the FBI and those involved in this scheme are laughable in their transparent attempt to cover up their criminal activities, relying on the naivetÃ© of the public for acceptance. The FBI issued a statement claiming that Mr. McCabe played no role, attended no events, and did not engage in any fundraising or support activities. However, it is crucial to question the extent of his involvement. Did he assist in spending the money? Did he benefit from the meals and accommodation that the funds provided? Furthermore, does it not”Xu
  Donald Trump and the Resurgence of American Masculinity  In recent weeks, there has been a growing debate over the perception that Donald Trump is unpopular among women. However, one must question the validity of these claims, as they rely heavily on polling methods and the interpretation of data. While a Gallup Poll suggested that up to 70% of women have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, it is important to consider other factors that may influence these numbers.  Looking beyond the polls, one can observe the enthusiasm and support for Trump among women at his rallies. Notably, the presence of Diamond and Silk, two influential women from Fayetteville, North Carolina, demonstrates that there is a considerable female following for Trump. It is crucial to note that these women are politically attracted to him, not romantically inclined. Their support lies in their desire to vote for him, not to enter into a personal relationship.  However, the Gallup Poll is an ongoing study, and as time progresses, a clearer picture emerges. It is worth mentioning the declining response rate to telephone polls, which raises questions about the accuracy of such data. Regardless, the narrative that Trump alienates women has gained traction among anti-Trump pundits, who frequently label him as a Neanderthal. David French, writing for National Review, argues that Trump's rise has justified a renewed focus on the upbringing of young males in America, with feminism being viewed as a potential threat to their development. French claims that some males, lacking exposure to virtuous masculinity, resort to negative stereotypes and adopt predatory behavior. Trump, in their eyes, becomes a hero embodying their ideals.  This sentiment is echoed in the world of pick-up artists and segments of the men's rights movement, where Trump is hailed as the ultimate alpha male. Fox News personalities like Andrea Tantaros and Stacey Dash have also expressed their support for Trump, viewing him as a symbol of traditional masculinity. Tantaros believes that the left has attempted to "feminize" the country, and Trump represents a last hope for blue-collar men to reclaim their masculinity. Dash even goes so far as to praise Trump's street-smart persona.  Critics argue that Trump's version of masculinity aligns with a caricatured, counterfeit portrayal that caters to the feminist nightmare. They claim that his focus on sex, money, and power embodies a distorted view of manhood, neglecting other aspects of life.  In conclusion, the debate surrounding Trump's appeal among women continues to divide opinion. While some polls suggest a significant portion of women hold an unfavorable”•ó      Xz   Surprise Emerges from San Diego Toilet, Prompting Pandemonium  SAN DIEGO - Stephanie Lacsa, an unsuspecting employee at a local workplace, received the shock of a lifetime on Wednesday when she ventured into the women's restroom. After noticing an unusually high water level in the toilet, Lacsa instinctively reached for a plunger, only to witness a startling sight. A brown, slithering creature began to emerge from the depths of the toilet, much to Lacsa's horror. "As soon as I caught a glimpse of its flickering tongue, I knew without a doubt that a massive snake was making a beeline towards me," Lacsa recounted, still shaken by the incident. In a state of panic, she promptly fled the bathroom, her screams echoing through the halls.  The shocking discovery prompted an immediate call to Animal Care and Control, who swiftly dispatched an officer to the scene. However, this was no ordinary call for assistance, as the officer admitted to never having dealt with such an unusual situation before. The mysterious origin of the 5-foot boa constrictor, now making its presence known through the plumbing, remains a puzzling enigma. Holly Wells, another tenant in the building, offered a plausible explanation, attributing the incident to the aging infrastructure of the historic Old San Diego City Hall. "Our building, dating back to 1886, has been accustomed to these antiquated pipes and their occasional stubbornness," Wells mused.  Fortunately, the boa constrictor was discovered alive and immediately transported to a local veterinarian for assessment. The hope now rests with finding a suitable permanent residence for the creature, ensuring it does not find its way back into the plumbing system. This bizarre incident serves as a potent reminder to all snake owners: always remember to put the toilet seat down, for one can never be too cautious when it comes to preventing such unexpected encounters.”X¹   Pelosi Stumbles in Attempt to Defend Clinton's Missteps  In an attempt to defend Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information, Nancy Pelosi appeared on CBS This Morning, a news program that some critics argue lacks credibility. During the interview, the host questioned Clinton's claim that she did not know the meaning of the letter "C" in emails, which designates confidential information. Pelosi attempted to downplay the issue, stating that voters should not be overly concerned, as the Secretary of State deals with a vast number of emails and only a few were marked confidential. Pelosi's defense, however, may have backfired, raising questions about when Clinton actually learned the meaning of these designations, considering she now claims to have skipped mandatory training.  The situation became even more perplexing when Clinton, during her questioning, portrayed herself as ignorant, claiming that she believed the classification markings were simply an attempt to alphabetize the paragraphs in her emails. This explanation seems dubious, as the FBI summary indicates that a "C" in parentheses within an email signifies a specific paragraph containing classified information. Pelosi's previous statement that classified markings would be problematic seems to contradict her current defense of Clinton.  Pelosi further argued that the information Clinton mishandled posed no threat to national security. However, this raises the question of why the classified markings were used in the first place if they did not carry any significance. Pelosi's attempts to downplay the issue and praise Clinton as a talented and knowledgeable leader only further highlight the inconsistencies in her defense.  Overall, Pelosi's appearance on CBS This Morning did little to alleviate concerns regarding Clinton's handling of classified information. Instead, it raised further questions about Clinton's understanding of the markings and the validity of her explanations.”X~
  $500K a Day: Illegal Housing at One Center, $300K a Day in Travel - DHS Faces Criticism for Mismanagement  The waste and mismanagement at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under Jeh Johnson has drawn strong criticism. Many argue that the practices of the department, which is run by Johnson, a known opponent of American values, are criminal. Johnson is often quick to claim that his budget shortfalls hinder his ability to enforce border control. However, it is his own wasteful practices, seemingly intentional, that create these shortfalls. This allows him to fabricate a situation where he has no choice but to disregard the law and allow illegal immigrants to freely roam within the United States. The extent of this waste is staggering.  According to an article in the Daily Mail, taxpayers are burdened with a daily cost of $300,000 for the expenses related to deporting illegal immigrants via commercial flights and private jets. In 2015 alone, ICE spent $116 million to transport 235,413 individuals back to their home countries, at an average cost of $492 per person. One might wonder why simpler and cheaper options, such as Greyhound buses, are not utilized. Instead, the government seems to spare no expense when it comes to the transportation of illegal immigrants. Perhaps a more effective solution would be to load them onto buses and transport them to the border, continuing south to Central America. If Mexico refuses to cooperate, imposing a bounty for each citizen that needs repatriation, as well as for citizens of other nations passing through Mexico, might incentivize them to address the issue.  However, the bulk of the expenses incurred are not related to travel costs. The cost of housing and supporting illegal immigrants is much higher and does not even include the expenses borne by individual states. The figures under Johnson, Obama, and Congress's immigration policies are staggering. ICE estimates that it costs $12,213 per illegal immigrant per year. Instead of simply denying illegal border crossers access to the United States, Secretary Johnson and President Obama have unilaterally decided to redefine the term refugee and grant every illegal immigrant a hearing, often scheduled for a distant future date that many do not bother to attend. According to this misguided liberal logic, American taxpayers are now responsible for supporting these individuals until their hearing date. This is an absurd and unsustainable situation.  One of the most egregious examples of reckless waste involves air travel for deportees. In addition to the cost of flying commercial, some illegal immigrants are given private luxury jet flights back to their”X 	  Title: Slain Border Agent's Blood: An Ongoing Crisis at the Hands of Obama and Congress  In a recent interview on "Judge Jeanine," Shawn Moran, representing the National Border Patrol Council, expressed his concern over the tragic death of Border Agent Javier Vega Jr. Moran's tweet, holding the White House and Congress responsible for the agent's untimely demise, sparked a heated discussion on the nation's border enforcement policies.   Moran argued that the United States fails to take border security seriously, leading to incidents like the one that claimed Agent Vega's life. The conversation delved into the issue of repeat offenders, highlighting the revolving door aspect of illegal immigrants who are deported multiple times without facing any consequences for their repeated violations.   Expressing his frustration, Moran questioned why anyone would willingly become a Border Patrol agent. He pointed out that these agents face a pay cut, inadequate manpower in the field, and stringent limitations on their ability to effectively perform their duties. According to him, both political parties seem to be disinterested in empowering the Border Patrol, rendering any enforcement measures ineffective due to policy decisions influenced by special interests, including the Mexican president.  Moran provided an example of the transportation system, where their efforts to curb illegal immigration were successful but ultimately halted due to complaints from influential lobbyist groups. This, he argued, exemplifies a history of backing down in the face of such special interests.   The interview also touched upon the views of conservative author Rick Wells, who believes that the nation, its Constitution, and its traditions are under threat from various sources. Wells encourages readers to engage further with his work on Facebook and Twitter, or visit his website www.rickwells.us.  The tragic death of Agent Vega has reignited the debate on border security and the effectiveness of current policies. Moran's interview shed light on the challenges faced by Border Patrol agents and the need for serious reforms in order to prevent future tragedies. The conversation emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to border enforcement, free from the influence of special interests.”XÖ  "Senator Lindsey Graham Criticizes Obama's Response to ISIS Threat"  In a recent interview with Chris Wallace, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) expressed his concerns regarding President Obama's strategy in Iraq. Graham criticized what he called a weak and ineffective response, characterizing it as a mere political maneuver to avoid negative press coverage during his tenure. According to Graham, every member of Congress has been warned about the existential threat posed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria. To counter this threat, Graham argued that the United States must take an offensive approach, as it is the only country with the necessary capabilities.  Graham emphasized the need for American air power to support opposition forces and friendly governments, stating that this is a minimum requirement to address the crisis. He also challenged Obama's statements that the United States would not become re-engaged in Iraq and that there is no military solution to the situation. Graham argued that these pronouncements directly threaten the American homeland, and that the responsibility of the commander-in-chief should outweigh any political promises.  According to Graham, if Obama fails to take offensive action against these terrorists, they will eventually target the United States. Graham warned that this threat extends beyond Baghdad or Syria and that if an attack occurs due to Obama's lack of strategy to protect the country, it will be a monumental blunder.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, shares Graham's concerns. He recognizes that our nation, Constitution, and traditions are currently facing multiple threats. Readers can find more of Wells' work on his Facebook page, Twitter account, or by visiting his website www.rickwells.us.”X¦  WATCH: Mark Steyn Criticizes Obama's Rebuke of Christians  In a surprising turn of events, President Barack Obama criticized the Christian community in his Easter address, stating that he gets concerned when he hears "less than loving expressions by Christians." These words sparked a wave of backlash and righteous indignation among conservatives and even some mainstream media outlets.  Mark Steyn, a prominent commentator, did not hold back in his response to Obama's remarks during an interview with Sean Hannity. Steyn expressed his disappointment in a roomful of Christians seemingly agreeing with Obama's narrow definition of "loving expressions." He pointed out that Jesus himself exhibited forceful firmness when he drove merchants and livestock out of the temple, as depicted in the Gospel passage above.  Steyn argued that Obama's understanding of Christianity, and the Bible for that matter, seems lacking. The President should not only be aware of the story of Jesus driving out the merchants but also the instances where Jesus called out the Pharisees for their hypocrisy and rebuked Judas Iscariot for his lack of understanding.  According to Steyn, these incidents are examples of love in the Christian context. Love, as depicted in the Bible, is not just about being generous and kind, but also about correcting errors, even if it means using sharp words. Steyn contended that Obama fails to grasp this concept.  It is clear that the President's rebuke of Christians has stirred up controversy and raised questions about his understanding of the faith. Steyn's critique serves as a reminder that love encompasses more than just sweetness; it requires genuine correction when necessary.”Xx
  Political Right Embraces New Social Media Platform as Alternative to Twitter and Facebook  In light of recent actions taken by Twitter and Facebook to enforce their community guidelines and crack down on hate speech, a new social media platform has emerged as a popular alternative. Gab, a site that prominently displays the first amendment on its splash page and features Pepe the frog as its symbol, was launched in August 2016 in response to the banishment of Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos from Twitter due to harassment.  Gab prides itself on allowing unrestricted free speech, with the exception of pornography, private information, threats, and terrorism, as outlined in their guidelines. The platform, described by The Guardian as a combination of Twitter and Reddit, enables users to post updates without character limits, while also sharing memes, links, and gifs. The Guardian also notes that tens of thousands of users are currently on a waitlist to join the platform.  Upon attempting to sign up for Gab, this writer discovered that the platform had already attracted a significant number of conservatives. A confirmation email indicated that it could take up to two weeks to gain access due to high demand and the service still being in beta. Those who have been able to join have noticed that much of the most popular content on Gab comes from alt-right accounts that were banned from Twitter. As a result, using Gab feels like interacting with exiled figures from the past. It appears that the political left underestimated the determination of the alt-right and conservatives to find another platform to gather online.  While The Guardian and other left-leaning publications have portrayed Gab as a gathering place for white supremacists, the platform's founder, Andrew Torba, vehemently denies these claims. Torba, who serves as Gab's CEO, stated on the platform that they welcome everyone and always will. However, it is noteworthy that it is currently challenging to find accounts on Gab that do not express support for Trump. While Torba insists that Gab is not a platform for racists, racially charged material can be found on the site. The motto at Gab is #SpeakFreely, which means that even racists are allowed to express their views (although other users are able to downvote such content).  So, who exactly is speaking freely on Gab? Prominent figures on the American political right, including Ann Coulter, Paul Joseph Watson, and Richard Spencer of the National Policy Institute, all of whom were banished from other social media platforms for their support of Donald Trump. Interestingly, Torba himself was one of the few Silicon Valley visionaries who”XÔ  New Ideas in Female Identities: Hijarbie Barbie  In the world of Barbie dolls, one woman in Nigeria is pushing for more diversity. Haneefah Adam, a 24-year-old studying for her master's degree in England, has come up with a unique concept: a Barbie doll that reflects her own identity, complete with a hijab and modest clothing. "It got me thinking about how I'd actually like to see a doll dressed up like I would have covered up," Adam told Mic.  Over the past week, Adam has taken to Instagram to share pictures of her Hijarbie dolls, showcasing the clothes she has designed for them. As a talented seamstress, Adam has crafted the hijabs and abayas for Barbie with great attention to detail. Should Adam decide to turn her passion into a business, there is a potential market for hijarbie clothing among those who dress in that manner.  However, like many others before her, Adam has chosen to play the guilt card, and the media, obsessed with diversity, is falling for it. Her idea of optional clothing for Barbie is being hailed as trendy, with glowing headlines applauding her efforts. "I want them to be inspired. This is about having an alternative and creating an awareness of having toys that adopt your religion and culture and resemble you, which ultimately improves self-esteem," Adam explained to Mic.  Adam's goal is to empower young girls who wear hijabs, showing them that they are just as beautiful as their Barbie companions. By hijabifying the dolls, she hopes to foster a sense of belonging and make a positive impact. It's worth noting that no good Catholic girl has come up with a Barbie in a Habit or Penguin Barbie with a nun-chucker and fire-breathing abilities, so perhaps Adam is on to something here. After all, this is part of her culture, and nuns are always covered up.  It's important to clarify that Mattel, the maker of Barbie, is not currently producing a new variety to cater to the hijab-wearing community. Adam is simply wishing for Barbie to reflect her own culture without actively working to make that happen, aside from providing some prototype clothing. This tinkering with yet another icon of Western culture, whether the doll is realistic or not, seems unnecessary. Let's keep our hands off the Barbies, shall we?”X	  Christians in Pakistan were targeted by terrorists on Easter Sunday, resulting in a rising death toll. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a group affiliated with ISIS, carried out the attack by sending a suicide bomber into a crowded park in Lahore. The bomb, described as a crude device filled with ball bearings, caused significant harm to its victims. The number of casualties has already exceeded 70, with over 300 people injured. Tragically, among the victims are several children, including Sahil Pervez, an 11-year-old student at a local Catholic school. His mother, who is already a widow, was devastated during a prayer service held for the victims.  The responsibility for the attack has been claimed by Ahsanullah Ahsan, a spokesperson for the terrorist group. It has been confirmed that the bomber specifically targeted Christians in the park. This same group had previously bombed two Christian churches in Lahore last year. Simultaneously, Islamic extremists in Pakistan's capital engaged in riots. They marched towards Parliament, setting vehicles on fire, smashing windows, and damaging bus stations. Despite the use of tear gas, the police were unable to control the rioters. The protesters are demanding the implementation of Sharia, Islamic law, and the execution of a Christian woman who is currently held for blasphemy. They are also critical of Prime Minister Sharif for his perceived Western leanings. The Prime Minister recently acknowledged the holidays celebrated by the country's minority communities, including Easter. (Christians constitute only 2% of Pakistan's population.) Additionally, a piece of legislation aimed at preventing violence against women has further angered the protesters.  Despite repeated assurances from our President and Secretary of State that ISIS is contained, this attack highlights the ongoing threat posed by the terrorist organization. In response to their reassurances, a quote from a popular movie comes to mind: "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." (Source: Fox News, 2016)”XÙ  Western Volunteers Join Kurdish Forces in Fight Against ISIS  Dozens of Western volunteers, appalled by the atrocities committed by ISIS, have taken up arms alongside the Kurdish Peshmerga army in Syria and Iraq. People from countries such as the United Kingdom, America, Germany, and Canada have reportedly answered the recruitment call from Lions of Rojava, a Facebook site run by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. Many of these volunteers have military backgrounds, according to The Muslim Issue.  Among those who have joined the fight are Americans Jordan Matson, an early US Army discharge, and Jeremy Woodard, an Army veteran with tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as six unidentified Canadian special forces veterans. Former British infantryman James Hughes, who served three tours in Afghanistan, and his friend Jamie Read, trained by the French army, are also volunteering. There are other individuals, including an Australian, who have chosen to remain anonymous.  Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-Israeli woman, became the first Westerner to join the female squads of the YPG. Reports of ISIS's cruelty, including the rape and murder of Christians, Yazidis, and even Muslims who do not agree with their ideology, have spurred these outside fighters to take action. The recent immolation of a Jordanian pilot in a cage was the latest atrocity to horrify the world. "How many people were sold into slavery or killed just for being part of a different ethnic group or religion?" Matson told The Associated Press. "That's something I am willing to die to defend. I'm not going back until the fight is finished and ISIS is crippled," he added.  The volunteers are motivated by a sense of duty to help those in need, despite the dangerous and challenging conditions they face. Some have already been wounded in action. Generally, Western nations, except for Australia, do not prohibit their citizens from volunteering as long as they are not fighting against their home countries. Assyrian Christians and Yazidis are also forming militias, providing additional options for the volunteers.  It is important to note that the views expressed in the latter part of the article do not represent the opinions of all individuals involved in the fight against ISIS.”X"	  Teen Girl Held Without Bail After Brutal Attack on Brother's Girlfriend  NEW RICHMOND, WISCONSIN - In a shocking turn of events, a 14-year-old girl has been charged as an adult and is now in police custody following a horrifying incident that left her brother's girlfriend with a slit throat. Kali Jade Bookey, the accused, called the St. Croix County Sheriffs Department on Wednesday morning, reporting an attempted abduction while she was riding her bike. However, the true motive behind this heinous act is even more disturbing.  Deputies promptly responded to the home of the girlfriend, who fortunately had not been taken but had suffered severe injuries. The victim described a different sequence of events from what Bookey had originally claimed. According to the girlfriend, the attacker entered her room while she was sleeping, dressed in black, and covered her mouth before brutally assaulting her. The assailant then proceeded to cut her throat with a broken piece of a bowl. Shockingly, the victim was able to identify her attacker as Bookey.  The motive behind this gruesome attack soon became clear. Bookey allegedly confessed to her hatred for her brother's girlfriend, driven by jealousy and the belief that her presence made her brother happier than Bookey could. The 14-year-old admitted to meticulously planning the attack for over a week, even conducting daily rides to the girlfriend's residence to gather information. Her ultimate goal was to eliminate the girlfriend, hoping that her brother would then return to the family.  During her confrontation with the victim, Bookey reportedly made chilling statements, including expressing her psychopathic tendencies and her intent to kill again. She even offered the victim a choice between death and bleeding out. Thankfully, the older girl chose the latter, ultimately saving her own life.  Bookey's mother, in a statement to the AP, expressed utter shock at her daughter's actions, claiming there were no warning signs. The family had no prior knowledge of Bookey's disturbing plans.  Bookey is currently being held without bail as she awaits trial. The severity and premeditated nature of her crime have led to her being charged as an adult. This tragic incident serves as a stark reminder of the darkness that can reside within even the youngest members of society.”XÂ  National Children's Study Terminated by NIH After $1.3 Billion Expenditure  In a staggering display of financial mismanagement, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has halted the National Children's Study after squandering a whopping $1.3 billion. This colossal waste of funds raises serious concerns about the nation's fiscal health. Initiated as part of the Children's Health Act of 2000, Congress mandated this ambitious project with the aim of monitoring 100,000 newborns from various locations across the country until they reached adulthood, in order to ascertain the impact of environmental and other factors on their health. However, despite 14 years of effort, the NIH spent the entirety of the budget deciphering the logistics of the study and conducting a handful of preliminary experiments. The actual study was not slated to commence until next year.  Warnings of impending disaster were raised long ago, prompting President George W. Bush to advocate canceling the study throughout his tenure. Despite such concerns, Congress continued to allocate funding. Issues with the study's design persisted, leaving it incomplete after over a decade of laborious work. Ultimately, the National Institutes of Health, after a fourteen-year investment of over $1.3 billion, made the decision to withdraw funding, citing the study's unsustainability. This revelation comes as no surprise.  It is disconcerting to consider the government's intrusive agenda to track and record personal data on 100,000 individuals from diverse regions across the nation. The termination of the National Children's Study raises questions not only about financial management but also about the ethical implications of such an ambitious endeavor.”XÇ   Israel's New Communication Director Criticizes Obama and Kerry  In a recent revelation, Benjamin Netanyahu's handpicked candidate for Israel's new Communications Director, Ran Baratz, has sparked controversy with his outspoken political views. Baratz, a 42-year-old philosophy lecturer, has been tasked with the important role of improving Israel's global reputation. He has been assigned to represent Israel's Public Diplomacy and Media Departments for the State.  Last March, Baratz took to Facebook to express his criticism of President Obama's response to Netanyahu's speech to the U.S. Congress, where he had voiced his concerns about the emerging Iran deal. Baratz went as far as to claim that Obama's reaction exemplified modern anti-Semitism in Western and liberal countries. In his post, Baratz also accused Obama of treating Israel's President as if he were not important enough to assassinate.  In response, President Obama acknowledged Iran's repeated engagement in anti-Semitic rhetoric, but maintained that Netanyahu had failed to offer viable alternatives to the core issue of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. It is clear that the Nuclear Deal remains a major point of disagreement between Obama and Netanyahu, as the former seeks to establish a lasting legacy while the latter prioritizes the security of his country.  Not stopping there, Baratz also targeted U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in another Facebook post, describing him as having the mentality of a 12-year-old. Netanyahu is planning a visit to the U.S. in order to address the deep disappointments and grievances concerning the Iran Nuclear Deal with Obama. Upon his return, President Netanyahu intends to meet with Baratz to discuss the controversial comments he made on Facebook.  This latest controversy surrounding Israel's new Communications Director raises questions about the boundaries of political discourse and the implications it may have on Israel's reputation on the world stage.”Xœ	  Opinion: The Troubling Influence of Reverend Al Sharpton  By Shep, Contributing Writer  In the midst of the recent protests and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, one figure has emerged as a divisive force: Reverend Al Sharpton. It is not an overstatement to say that Sharpton's actions and rhetoric have contributed to the violence and destruction we have witnessed in this community.  Inciting violence is a crime, and it is time that Sharpton be held accountable for his actions. He is a racist who deserves to be behind bars, not roaming free and encouraging others to do his dirty work. While others are out on the streets, destroying property and getting arrested, Sharpton remains safely ensconced in his home, far removed from the chaos he has helped create.  One must question Sharpton's true motives. Does he truly care about the people of Ferguson, or is he simply interested in profiting off their suffering? It seems clear that his primary concern is his own financial gain. While others are fighting on the front lines, he is laughing all the way to the bank.  The police in Ferguson are no different from their counterparts in any other city. They are human beings who make mistakes, just like the rest of us. They are out there, trying to protect our community, while Sharpton continues to profit from their destruction. This is not a race problem; it is a reverend problem named Al Sharpton.  Sharpton's actions are a far cry from the values espoused by the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. King preached nonviolence and love for one another, while Sharpton incites others to fight. His behavior is not only morally reprehensible but also criminal. It is high time for him to face the consequences of his actions and be put behind bars.  By removing Sharpton from the equation, we can begin to address the root causes of our racial problems. His influence has caused African Americans to hate the police, who are simply trying to protect their communities and serve their country. The riots, the loss of businesses and homes â€“ all of this has been orchestrated by a man who craves power and attention.  It is disheartening to see how many people blindly follow Sharpton, like sheep following a shepherd. They believe that a black leader will lead them to victory, but they fail to see that he is leading them astray. It is time for them to open their eyes and realize the harm that Sharpton is causing.  In the end, Sharpton will have to answer to”X¨  Trump Makes Unprecedented Outreach to Black America, Allen West Offers Support  In a surprising move, Donald Trump is making efforts to reach out to black and Hispanic voters, a strategy that has not been seen before in the Republican Party. With his straightforward and direct approach, Trump poses a challenging question for many Democratic supporters: "What do you have to lose?" Ohio Rep Marcia Fudge responded by stating that the respect of the world is at stake, a sentiment that may not resonate with black voters who struggle to see how it can help them in their everyday lives. Rep G K Butterfield, a black caucus leader from North Carolina, deemed Trump's statement a slap in the face, a reaction that may be more reflective of his own party's disappointing performance.  Colonel Allen West, a prominent figure in the Republican Party, offers his analysis on the situation between black Americans and the two major political parties. He argues that it is unacceptable for the black community to invest all of its political capital in one party, particularly considering the lack of beneficial returns. West cites issues such as high unemployment rates, the disintegration of the black family, the decline of inner cities, limited small business opportunities, and the lack of educational choice and opportunities. He compares this investment strategy to sticking with a failing stock or mutual fund, despite the potential for better results elsewhere.  While West applauds Trump's outreach efforts, he believes that the Republican nominee needs to go beyond rhetoric and actually engage with the communities he is targeting. West even offers to stand alongside Trump on stage in inner city Atlanta if asked to do so, a gesture that could potentially resonate with voters in these areas.  In conclusion, Trump's unprecedented approach to black America has sparked debate among both Democrats and Republicans. While some criticize his statements as disrespectful or ineffective, others, like Allen West, see it as an opportunity to address the longstanding issues faced by the black community. The question remains whether Trump's outreach will translate into tangible support from black and Hispanic voters.”XÊ	  Nine Chinese Nationals Apprehended While Attempting Unauthorized Entry into United States as Media Captures the Moment at Unsecured Border  In a riveting display of the ongoing border security challenges, a group of nine Chinese individuals was intercepted by border patrol agents as they attempted to unlawfully enter the United States. The dramatic incident unfolded before the lenses of news cameras, shedding light on the vulnerabilities of an unguarded border.  The audacious attempt occurred at a section of the border that has been a subject of intense debate and controversy, where concerns about illegal crossings have been a focal point of national discourse. As cameras rolled, border patrol agents swiftly moved in to apprehend the individuals, who were later identified as Chinese nationals.  The striking visuals captured by the media underscore the urgency of addressing border security, as the footage showcased a porous border that has become a gateway for unlawful entry. The incident resonates with broader debates surrounding immigration policy and the need for enhanced border control measures.  While the circumstances surrounding the Chinese nationals' journey remained unclear, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the lengths to which individuals are willing to go in their pursuit of a new life in the United States. The allure of a better future continues to drive individuals to embark on treacherous journeys, risking their lives and freedom in the process.  The interception of these nine Chinese individuals further highlights the challenges faced by border patrol agents who tirelessly work to secure the nation's borders. Their relentless efforts to combat illegal immigration are hampered by the very vulnerabilities that are exposed by incidents such as this one.  As the nation grapples with the complex issue of immigration, discussions surrounding border security have taken center stage. The footage captured during this interception serves as a vivid reminder of the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reforms, including robust measures to secure the nation's borders.  The incident involving the nine Chinese nationals is a microcosm of the larger immigration debate, highlighting the delicate balance between compassion and the rule of law. As the United States continues to navigate this complex terrain, the fate of those who seek to cross the border will undoubtedly remain a powerful symbol of the nation's ongoing struggle to control its borders.”X:
  Hotel Guest Discovers Controversial Do Not Disturb Door Hangers, Raising Concerns Over Cultural Sensitivity  During a recent business trip to the Chicago area, a traveler stumbled upon a surprising mistake at his hotel. It wasn't a minor housekeeping oversight or a forgotten item from a previous guest. The Comfort Inn in Downers Grove, Illinois seemed to be communicating in Ebonics, a dialect associated with African American Vernacular English. The hotel's Do Not Disturb door hangers featured a young black woman seemingly engrossed in a book, with the text underneath stating, "Do not disturb. Resting up in here." The potential implications of this choice of language and image were not lost on the observant guest.  One may wonder how the executives at Comfort Inn failed to foresee the potential controversy surrounding such a design. Not only did they choose to use a phrase associated with inner-city slang, but they also paired it with an image of a black woman, intensifying the potential for misinterpretation. It is baffling how this oversight occurred.  Some may argue that this was an ill-conceived attempt at humor, aiming to bridge cultural divides. However, when questioned, the hotel's manager, Mr. Patel, expressed complete surprise, claiming that this was the first he had heard of the issue. This suggests that it was indeed an unintentional mistake, rather than a clever attempt at inclusivity.  Had members of organizations such as the ACLU or NAACP stayed at this Comfort Inn recently, it is likely that a wave of controversy would have ensued. Figures like Al Sharpton, renowned civil rights activist, would have undoubtedly accused the hotel chain of perpetuating racial stereotypes and insinuating that black individuals are incapable of using proper grammar. Calls for a boycott of all Comfort Inns until the offensive door hangers were removed would have surely followed. Perhaps even the President would have weighed in, addressing the issue from the Rose Garden and decrying the presence of racial bias in the hospitality industry. It is worth noting that if the picture on the hanger had depicted a young white woman, there would have been outrage over cultural appropriation.  Until the matter gains attention from the politically correct crusaders, those unaffected by the controversy can enjoy a chuckle at Comfort Inn's expense. To avoid interruptions, one might consider posting a note that humorously reads, "Do not disturb. Laughing up in here."  It remains to be seen how Comfort Inn will respond to this incident, but it serves as a reminder for all businesses to be mindful”X¹
  UN Threatens American Patriots with Judgment of Them and the Invading People  In a recent address, Prince Zeid Raad Al Hussein, the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, expressed his concerns about rising xenophobia and bigotry in various countries. However, his remarks were met with strong criticism from some American patriots who perceive them as an attack on their values and their nation.  Prince Zeid's appearance and demeanor defy the stereotypical image of a pirate. Rather than the boisterous and rugged figure often portrayed in movies, he presents himself as a soft-spoken, intelligent, and refined individual. This calculated approach allows him to mask his intentions and deceive those around him. Some critics argue that his background, having been educated with funds allegedly extorted from the American people through the oil industry, raises suspicions about his true motives. They point to his marriage to the daughter of a British geologist who worked closely with big oil companies as evidence of his association with this circle of influence.  However, it is important to note that Prince Zeid's role as the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner is not merely a title lacking substance. His position carries weight and influence, as he represents the largest international organization dedicated to promoting human rights and equality. Yet, some American patriots dismiss his authority and reject his criticism, claiming that they do not value his opinion or support his alleged attempts to take over their country.  The prince's recent visit to the United States further fueled the controversy surrounding his remarks. During his visit, he criticized what he perceives as racist and xenophobic attitudes among certain segments of the American population. His comments angered those who view themselves as defenders of their nation's values and see Prince Zeid's words as an attack on their patriotism.  While Prince Zeid's remarks have struck a chord with some individuals who believe that the U.N. and other international entities are encroaching on their sovereignty, it is essential to recognize that his intention is likely not to support an "Islamic invasion," as some critics suggest. Rather, he is highlighting the importance of combating prejudice and discrimination, which he believes are prevalent in many societies.  In conclusion, the clash between Prince Zeid and some American patriots reflects a divide on issues of national identity, immigration, and human rights. While some view the prince's comments as intrusive and condescending, others argue that his concerns are valid and should be addressed. The debate continues as both sides strive to defend their values and ideals in an increasingly interconnected world.”X  Bookmakers in the United Kingdom are giving improved odds for a Donald Trump victory in the upcoming U.S. election, according to the system that accurately predicted the Brexit vote. While Vegas odds still favor Hillary Clinton, the British bookmaker William Hill reports that 65 percent of bets placed are for Trump, despite 71 percent of the money staked being on Clinton. This pattern mirrors what was seen before the Brexit vote, where the majority of bets were for Leave despite money being on Remain. The movement in betting patterns suggests that Trump's chances may be stronger than portrayed by the American news media, which has been accused of gaslighting and underestimating his support. This serves as a reminder that every vote counts, particularly in this crucial election year.”X8  Watch Rosen Defend His Record and Cameron Discuss Vacationing Congress on O'Reilly  In the realm of linguistics, James Rosen possesses a remarkable repertoire of words that many would yearn to have at their disposal. His verbal prowess is particularly evident when he succeeds in casting a negative light on John Kerry, a definite fringe benefit of his profession. Additionally, Carl Cameron enlightens us on the fact that Congress will not convene until after the forthcoming election, all the while drawing salaries exceeding $170,000, with the added luxury of generous expense accounts. It is rather perplexing to discern whether this absence of legislative activity is a positive or negative phenomenon, as it leaves reporters as the only individuals diligently fulfilling their duties within the confines of Washington.”X¥  Rehana, a renowned female Kurdish fighter who is credited with killing more than 100 ISIS militants, has reportedly been beheaded. This remarkable statistic was shared by journalist Pawan Durani in a tweet on October 13th, which has since garnered thousands of retweets. Although the execution of Rehana has not been officially confirmed, various sources, including The International Business Times, have reported on her capture and subsequent death. ISIS has even circulated a photo of her decapitated body, further suggesting the grim reality of her demise. If these reports are indeed accurate, Rehana will be remembered alongside Kurdish fighter Dilar Gencxemis, who sacrificed her life in an attack on ISIS fighters outside of Kobani.  The presence of women on the battlefield is feared by fundamentalist jihadists, who believe that dying in jihad will grant them 72 virgins in heaven. However, if they are killed by a woman, they are denied this reward. Rehana was part of an independent women's battalion of the Peshmerga, the Kurdish militia, known for their bravery and effectiveness in war. Under the leadership of Mayssa Abdo, a renowned female soldier, Rehana fought to keep the Syrian border town of Kobani out of the hands of ISIS. The YPJ, an all-female independent militia, fought alongside male soldiers of the Peoples Protection Units at the frontline.  While this news circulates, it is important to note that some comments made in response to this story on social media platforms contain misleading information and hate speech towards Muslims. It is crucial to strive for accurate reporting and respectful dialogue when discussing sensitive subjects such as religion and terrorism.”XM  "Analyzing Democrats: Nancy Pelosi's Evasive Interview Unveils Obama's Inaccessibility and Disengagement"  In a recent appearance on the Morning Joe program, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi inadvertently shed light on the inner workings of the Democratic Party. Rather than directly addressing the question posed by sympathetic Democrat Mike Barnicle about President Obama's remote and emotionally detached demeanor, Pelosi skillfully deflected and redirected the conversation towards her desired narrative. This tactic is a familiar one employed by Democrats when faced with uncomfortable queries.  Pelosi chose to emphasize statistics that could easily be manipulated to deflect attention and divert the conversation away from the unexplainable aspects of Obama's presidency. She even attempted to take credit for the nation's energy growth, conveniently glossing over her party's efforts to impede such progress. Additionally, she proudly touted the success of Obamacare in California, seemingly unconcerned with the struggling economy and the financial burden it places on hardworking Americans. This is a classic example of the socialist mindset, where the government takes precedence over individual economic well-being.  By evading the question and employing damage control techniques, Pelosi and Obama reveal their true motivations. They prioritize their own power and the advancement of socialist policies above all else, displaying a clear disregard for the concerns and opinions of the American people. Despite their public personas, they are not out of touch with reality; rather, they are fully aware of their actions and the consequences they may have. As long as their power remains intact, they remain indifferent to public sentiment.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, recognizes the multitude of threats our nation, Constitution, and traditions currently face. These challenges necessitate a critical evaluation of the actions and motivations of our political leaders.

  Globalist Gingrich Attacks Little Trump As Real Newt Crawls Out From Rocks  In a surprising turn of events, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, known for his globalist leanings, has recently taken aim at Republican nominee Donald Trump. Many Americans, skeptical of Gingrich's previous support for Trump during the primary season, believed there was more to his allegiance than met the eye. Suspicions arose that Gingrich was attempting to co-opt the movement for his own gain, particularly if he were to secure the Vice-Presidential nomination. However, Trump, ever the shrewd decision-maker, chose Governor Mike Pence as his running mate instead. Pence, like Trump, is seen as a Washington outsider who is unencumbered by the trappings of the establishment.  The moment that many anticipated finally arrived on Thursday morning during Gingrich's appearance on Fox Business News. It became evident that Gingrich took personal offense when Trump called out House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow advocate for global governance, for his disloyalty and alleged attempts to undermine the campaign. Gingrich, perhaps feeling a sense of loyalty towards Ryan and his shared belief in a world government, refused to defend the traitorous Speaker. It is widely believed that Ryan played a role in the release of the infamous Billy Bush Bus Ambush video, and his actions throughout the campaign have shown that he is no friend of Trump. Along with Senators Mike Lee, John McCain, Jeff Flake, and others, Ryan was part of the political establishment's attempt to destroy Trump's candidacy - a plot that ultimately failed but continues to this day even after being exposed.  Gingrich now appears to be on a mission to distract the American public from these traitorous actions. By downplaying the significance of Ryan and his cohorts' attempted coup, Gingrich hopes to dissuade voters from questioning their motives and potentially withholding their support. Gingrich's loyalty lies with the establishment, and he is revealing his true colors by creating a sound bite that portrays Trump in a negative light. With his vast experience in politics, Gingrich knew exactly what he was doing by aligning himself publicly with Ryan and the globalists against Trump and the American people. His recent comments, presented under the guise of offering advice to Trump, were not intended to be helpful but rather to inflict damage. Trump's frustration lies not in the lack of a phone call from Ryan, as Gingrich suggests, but in the ongoing attacks against him. The phone call remarks were merely a minor aspect of a larger issue. Gingrich understands this perfectly well but chooses to feign ignorance”Xj  Title: White House Press Secretary Cites Conservative Authors for Hillary Clinton's Failure to Meet Disclosure Rules  In a tense exchange with ABC's Jon Karl, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest resorted to shifting blame onto conservative authors for Hillary Clinton's failure to adhere to the administration's disclosure rules. The incident occurred during today's press briefing, where Karl inquired about Clinton's lapse in meeting the set standards.  Earnest's attempt to deflect the issue onto conservative authors and their research was met with skepticism from observers. The press secretary's response came after Karl highlighted the fact that a prominent member of the Administration had accepted millions of dollars in donations without disclosing them.  The incident has raised questions about the Obama White House's commitment to the very standards it had established. Critics argue that this disregard for disclosure rules undermines the credibility of the administration, likening it to the infamous red lines drawn by President Obama in dealing with murderous regimes.  The controversy surrounding Clinton's failure to meet disclosure requirements threatens to overshadow the Obama administration's efforts to enforce transparency and accountability within its ranks. As the 2016 presidential campaign intensifies, the incident serves as ammunition for critics who argue that political elites, regardless of party affiliation, often prioritize personal interests over public transparency.  The exchange between Karl and Earnest underscores the tensions that exist between the press and the administration. Journalists, tasked with holding those in power accountable, continue to probe the actions and decisions of the White House, seeking transparency and explanations.  As the controversy unfolds, it remains to be seen whether the Obama administration will address the issue and take steps to ensure the adherence to its own disclosure standards. In an era marked by heightened scrutiny of public officials, it is imperative that political leaders uphold the principles of transparency and accountability to maintain public trust.”Xæ  Gun Group Marches in Austin, Chanting Anti-Police Slogans  In the midst of ongoing debates over open carry laws in Texas, a Dallas-based gun club, named after one of the co-founders of the Black Panthers, took to the streets of Austin this week. The Huey P. Newton Gun Club, in what seemed to be an attempt to showcase their strength, marched through the city chanting slogans that expressed anti-police sentiments. A video capturing the march has raised concerns, particularly in light of recent events since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.   According to Erick Khafre, a member of the group, the main focus of the club is to legally arm all African Americans and promote self-policing in the community. However, the disturbing imagery in the video, as well as another produced by Alex Jones InfoWars, raises questions about the group's intentions. Moreover, there have been reports linking charitable donations to the #BlackLivesMatter movement to a foundation financially supported by George Soros, a Hungarian billionaire notorious for his interest in stirring up social unrest in the United States.   While the connection between the armed march in Austin and the overall #BlackLivesMatter movement remains unclear, one thing is certain: the members of the Huey P. Newton Gun Club have a deep mistrust of the police, and they are not afraid to express it through graphic and slanderous chants. While their stated goal may be to educate African Americans about their Second Amendment rights and encourage self-defense, the optics of their actions suggest a different narrative.  It is worth noting that the Department of Justice's report on Ferguson revealed a disconcerting fact: in the city of Ferguson, almost everyone has a criminal record.”XX
  Obama Hosts UN Human Rights Investigator After an extensive seventeen-day tour of the United States, engaging with various groups, including affiliates of the well-known Black Lives Matter movement, a United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur has emerged as an authority on American society. Maina Kiai, the UN expert, released a report on Wednesday asserting that the United States is plagued by racism and exploitation, particularly targeting the descendants of the country's settlers, commonly referred to as white people. Kiai also presented Black Lives Matter as a grassroots response to the historical mistreatment and marginalization of black individuals over centuries. One might be surprised at the speed with which Kiai seemingly became an expert on our nation. However, when one sends a black globalist human rights advocate from the UN to investigate racism in America, such findings are to be expected. This raises the question of why the globalist entity of the UN feels the need to interfere in our internal affairs. Notably, it should come as no surprise that President Barack Obama invited them to act as investigative agents. The collaboration between the UN and Obama is well-established, as both parties share a common objective: dismantling our Constitutional republic and self-governance system. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., Kiai claimed, "The country was founded on land stolen from its indigenous Native Americans; its early economic strength was built on race-based slavery against people of African descent; and successive waves of immigrants have faced discrimination, harassment or worse." As an enlightened global elitist, Mr. Kiai would likely be able to promptly answer a question regarding his findings. If the United States has been a hotbed of injustice for over two centuries, why have individuals risked their lives to come here, both in the past and present? Although he may take his time to respond, it is unlikely that he would need much time at all. After all, he managed to become an expert on our nation within a mere two weeks. Similar to his compatriot, Barack Obama, Kiai hails from Kenya. They are both undoubtedly more intelligent and superior to the rest of us. Kiai, a resident of Nairobi, is particularly astute as a big city Kenyan. The joint attack on the United States by Obama and the UN is clearly evident in this orchestrated affair. Kiai was specifically tasked with assessing the freedom of peaceful assembly and association in the US. In the opening of his remarks, he expressed gratitude to the US government, specifically Obama, for extending the invitation to meddle”XÖ  Susan Rice Attempts to Highlight Hillary Clinton's Achievements  In a recent interview with Bloomberg, National Security Advisor Susan Rice discussed a range of topics, including her own current endeavors. However, the Bloomberg hosts took the opportunity to inquire about Hillary Clinton's accomplishments during her tenure as Secretary of State. This prompted a reflection on the American standard for achievement and raised questions about the true extent of Clinton's achievements.  Critics argue that Clinton's accomplishments can be succinctly summarized on a postage stamp. Furthermore, they claim that Rice's involvement only serves to further tarnish her own reputation due to her association with the Benghazi incident. It is important to note that Clinton's tenure was marred by the tragic loss of American lives, a fact that is often overlooked by her supporters. Additionally, detractors argue that Clinton's demeanor and behavior can be deemed unfavorable, labeling her as an "Old Hag Bitch."  These assertions shed light on the ongoing debate surrounding Clinton's legacy as Secretary of State and the extent of her achievements. As the discussion continues, it remains to be seen how history will judge her time in office.”Xö  In a highly anticipated decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the Obama Administration's order for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enforce net neutrality. The 2-1 vote upheld the FCC's declaration of the internet as a utility, ensuring that internet service providers (ISPs) cannot pro-rate costs based on users' internet consumption.  The net neutrality order, which was passed over a year ago, is considered FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's signature move during his time at the commission. Wheeler expressed his satisfaction with the ruling, stating that it is a victory for consumers and innovators who deserve unrestricted access to the entire internet. He believes this decision will maintain the internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, and economic growth.  This ruling comes after a decade of debate and legal battles, solidifying the FCC's authority to enforce strong internet protections on both fixed and mobile networks. ISPs, including Comcast, ATT, and Verizon, had challenged the FCC's ruling on the grounds of the First Amendment, arguing that mobile broadband should not be subject to the 1996 Telecommunications Act and that the internet itself is not a utility. However, two members of the Circuit Court panel, both Democrat appointees, rejected these arguments.  ISPs have long sought to defeat net neutrality, as it prevents them from charging more for services that consume a significant amount of broadband, such as streaming Netflix. They claim that these services slow down internet speeds for other customers. However, Comcast has admitted that its efforts to impose broadband usage caps are primarily driven by financial motives rather than engineering necessities. Usage caps allow ISPs to charge more for the same product and help protect traditional TV revenues from competition with internet video.  Overall, this court ruling is seen as a win for internet users who value an open and accessible internet. It ensures that ISPs cannot discriminate against certain online services or charge consumers extra for data-intensive activities. The decision affirms the FCC's ability to regulate the internet and protect consumers, solidifying the principle of net neutrality for years to come.”X¹
  New Scientific Findings Challenge Climate Change Theory  In a groundbreaking study, a team of atmospheric chemistry experts from France and Germany have discovered a new process that emits significant amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere from the sea. This process, previously unknown, has not been taken into account by existing climate models. VOCs have a cooling effect on the climate, meaning that current models may overestimate the amount of warming that can be expected.  While the cooling effects of isoprene, a key VOC, are well known, the study reveals that the oceans produce much larger quantities of it than previously thought. This finding further supports the argument that climate models do not accurately represent the complex reality of the climate system.  Dr. Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, commented on the study, stating, "Here is more evidence of what we have known for some time: that climate models simply do not mirror the reality of a complex system and that they should never have been trusted in the first place."  As world leaders prepare to gather in Paris to discuss a climate treaty, skeptics argue that the problem of climate change may not be as severe as it is portrayed. They point out that the planet has not experienced any warming since 1988 and that many predictions made by climate scientists have not come true.  Despite these new scientific discoveries, critics argue that the world should not rush to implement drastic measures that could harm economies based on incomplete computer models and the alarmist claims of climate scientists.  The study reveals that isoprene, a key VOC, is produced not only by living organisms but also by sunlight acting on floating chemicals at the top of the ocean. This finding challenges the previous assumption that isoprene is only produced by plants, trees, and plankton. The researchers emphasize that this abiotic production of VOCs has not been factored into global calculations, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the sources and effects of VOCs on climate.  Dr. Christian George from the Institute of Catalysis and Environment in Lyon, France, explains, "We were able for the first time to trace back the production of this important aerosol precursor to abiotic sources. So far, global calculations consider only biological sources." VOCs, including isoprene, play a significant role in climate change as they contribute to the formation of aerosol particles.  These new findings challenge the prevailing consensus on climate change and highlight the need for further research to refine our understanding of the complex factors influencing the Earth's climate system.”X   Islamic Preacher Arrested for Harassing Woman in UK  In a recent incident in the UK, a Muslim street preacher, Krissoni Henderson, was arrested for harassing a woman on the street. The incident, captured on video, shows Henderson shouting obscenities at the woman and continuously shouting "Allah Akbar." The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, called the police to report the harassment.  Henderson, who is unemployed, seemed to have a lot of time on his hands to act out on behalf of his Islamic religion. This incident contradicts the belief, quoted by US President Barack Obama, that Islam is a peaceful religion.  When the police officer arrived at the scene, Henderson continued his aggressive behavior, yelling at the officer in Arabic. However, the officer managed to maintain composure and handled the situation appropriately. He asked Henderson to listen as he explained the law to him and his group of supporters.  The incident caused a small crowd of young Muslim men to gather around the preacher, who continued to shout "Allah Akbar" and incite them. The officer reminded Henderson that he had the right to freely express his opinions in public, but if he committed a public order offense, he would be arrested.  After conducting an investigation, the police found the woman's claims of harassment to be valid. Henderson was subsequently arrested and charged with racial aggression towards her. He is scheduled to appear in court on September 6, 2016. It is hoped that appropriate legal consequences, such as jail time or deportation, will be imposed.  This incident serves as a reminder of the challenges that law enforcement officers face when dealing with such situations. It also raises concerns about the potential increase in similar incidents if more Muslim refugees are allowed into the country.”X+
  In the realm of history, politics, and ideology, we find ourselves surrounded by a sea of ignorance and lack of understanding. It is not uncommon to encounter individuals who are unable to place the Civil War in the correct century or locate major countries on a map. Unfortunately, there are entire political ideologies that thrive on this mind-numbing and occasionally alarming ignorance, using it as a source of power and influence.   I perceive liberalism/progressivism as a toxic force, an ideological and philosophical malignancy that wreaks havoc on society. It maliciously and destructively affects everything it touches, from the sanctity of human life to the traditional family structure, which serves as the bedrock of civilization. It undermines national security, free enterprise, and much more. In essence, it represents a threat to all that I hold dear and stands as the bane of Western Civilization and personal liberty. Moreover, it often aligns itself, whether intentionally or unintentionally, with some of the most repugnant political philosophies in history. Hence, it is imperative that we oppose it at every opportunity.  Unlike those who live in an ideological vacuum, I actively embrace an ideology and a worldview. Liberalism is an insidious, corrupting, and deceptive ideology that despises everything I consider to be true, right, and just. It resembles not only a political philosophy but also a religion or a mental ailment. Consequently, I am committed to fighting against it wherever, whenever, and however I can. I take pride in being on the front lines of the cultural and ideological battles for the heart and soul of our nation. No apologies are necessary.  We are presently engaged in a monumental struggle for the essence, spirit, and future of not only our nation but also the great Western Civilization itself. Progressivism obliterates everything that is virtuous and fair, relentlessly waging war against all that I hold sacred, righteous, and genuine. It shows no mercy and is unbound by the confines of tradition, values, honesty, or the rule of law. It dismantles free enterprise, inundates our nation with both legal and illegal immigrants, undermines and redefines the family, derides our traditions, permits the killing of the unborn, disregards our history, mocks Christianity, and systematically erodes morals and values at every turn.  It is crucial to recognize that there are not two equally valid ideologies from which to choose. Not all paths lead to truth. We would rather not traverse down the road to serfdom, and it is not an act of paranoia to”•	     Xü	  Jihad! Coming To A City Near You!  Those planning Jihad are well aware of their actions. In the past, this country has experienced unexpected attacks, such as the infamous events of December 1941 and September 2001. However, one does not need to be a Marine to perceive an impending ambush. This time, we are able to see it approaching. When our history books are written a century from now, they will describe one of two scenarios. Either we narrowly evaded the most catastrophic war the world has ever witnessed, or we lost over one hundred million lives due to our naivety.  Why must we wait for tragedy to strike before taking preventive measures? It is crucial to hope for the best, but also to anticipate the worst and prepare for the unforeseen. This is an investigation into an organization that insults God by propagating hate while hiding behind religion. These individuals are cowardly, inflicting harm upon women and children. They are not innately inclined to hate; rather, they are taught to hate. The reason we are a free country becomes evident. These malicious individuals seek to dismantle our freedom, and that is something I strongly oppose. They believe they can control us through fear, but I am here to assure them that we are no longer afraid. Unfortunately, our compassion is sometimes mistaken for weakness. However, if they continue to harm our children, the sleeping giant will awaken. Let our adversaries be forewarned; they are reading this. If they do not appreciate us, then they should leave our homeland. We will respect their boundaries if they respect ours.  Many have taken an oath to safeguard this country and protect its freedoms. This oath is not merely a collection of words on paper; it runs through the veins of every Marine. It is a commitment until death, so Semper Fi America. Our adversaries have exploited our system before, and they are doing so again. Some of them are in this country legally, while others are not. They are dispersed across the nation, occupying various professions, including doctors, lawyers, military personnel, and individuals from all fields. They are instructed to avoid drawing attention to themselves, much like the hijackers of 9/11. They come and go freely, becoming acquainted with every aspect of the land. Their purpose is not to plan an isolated attack; they are preparing for a war!  They avoid communicating via phone, internet, or within the privacy of their homes. Instead, they meet in public spaces like malls or parks. They even frequent the pools at local apartment”XÇ  Road Rage Incident Ends in Tragedy for Mother of Four  Byline: [Author Name]  OAKLAND, Calif. - Luis Lopez Gallegos and his wife, Perla Avina, were heading home from a routine trip to the grocery store on Sunday afternoon, just a short distance away from their residence. The couple had plans to enjoy the Raiders game with their loved ones later that day. Little did they know that their lives would be forever altered around 12:30 p.m.  According to Gallegos, the events leading up to the incident remain hazy. However, he vividly recalls another driver expressing dissatisfaction with his driving, which culminated in a sudden eruption of gunshots. Tragically, one of the bullets struck Avina in the head, claiming the life of the 30-year-old mother within minutes.  Dwayne Jackson, Gallegos' next-door neighbor, happened to be outside his house when Gallegos pulled up abruptly, parking halfway in the driveway. "He called to me," Jackson recounted. "He said, 'D, call 911. My wife's been shot.'" The neighbor sprang into action, attempting to resuscitate Avina, but the absence of any signs of life dashed any hopes of her survival. "There was no waking up," Jackson lamented. "For this to happen at noon, when most people are coming home from church, is simply dreadful."  Avina, a medical clerk at a pain rehabilitation center in Emeryville, left behind a grieving husband and four children - her three daughters aged 1, 4, and 8, and her 14-year-old son. Gallegos and Avina, who had been high school sweethearts, had a close-knit family. Gallegos spoke of their four-year-old daughter, saying, "She doesn't understand. She keeps asking when Mommy is coming home. It still hasn't sunk in."  The tragedy of this incident underscores the profound and irreversible consequences of a split-second decision driven by something as minor as an everyday traffic annoyance. As of now, the shooter remains at large. Authorities are urging anyone with information to contact the Oakland PD Homicide Division at (510) 238-3821 or Oakland Crime Stoppers at (510) 777-8572. A reward of $30,000 is being offered for any leads that could lead to the perpetrator's arrest.  While the focus remains on finding justice for Avina and her grieving family, it is”XE
  Gun Free Zones in America: Do They Really Work?  In recent years, the debate surrounding gun control in the United States has reached new heights. Supporters argue that stricter regulations are necessary to prevent tragedies like the mass shootings in Aurora and Paris. However, a recent incident in Houston has prompted some to question the effectiveness of gun-free zones.  Just a few days ago, a fourteen-year-old boy found himself in a terrifying situation. Awoken by his mother's pleas for help, he discovered intruders in his home. Thankfully, he knew where his father kept his gun, and his family was able to defend themselves. The boy managed to shoot and kill one intruder, while injuring another. The third intruder fled the scene but was later apprehended.  Curiously, this incident received little attention in the media. It seems that it did not fit the narrative of gun control activists. Had the intruders used guns to harm the family, it surely would have made headlines. This raises the question of whether gun-free zones truly protect innocent lives.  I, too, have experienced the devastating consequences of being unarmed in the face of danger. A dear friend of mine was tragically murdered by a man with a gun. If we had access to a firearm that day, my friend might still be with us. The presence of a gun might have deterred the gunman from targeting us, as he would have known there was a chance of encountering resistance.  Perhaps gun control activists should consider putting signs in their yards declaring their lack of firearms. They could even go a step further by getting rid of their armed security and openly advertising their vulnerability. I would wager that they wouldn't last a month without being targeted by criminals. Just ask the linebacker coach for the Houston Texans, whose wife's tweet about their absence led to the loss of three Super Bowl rings.  It's important to remember that guns are not the only cause of death and injury in our society. Accidents while driving claim over 30,000 lives each year, with alcohol-related incidents accounting for 10,000 of those deaths. Yet, we do not advocate for the elimination of cars to prevent drunk driving. Similarly, banning guns will not stop criminals from committing crimes. The existence of bad people in this world is an unfortunate reality that cannot be changed.  Politicians often claim that their primary duty is to protect the American people. However, they themselves have armed bodyguards for protection. This hypocrisy is difficult to ignore. The second amendment has been a cornerstone of this nation for over two centuries,”XO	  New Voter Poll Reveals Surprising Perspective on American Politics  In a recent national telephone survey conducted by Rasmussen, a startling revelation emerged regarding the biggest problem in American politics. Contrary to popular belief, it's not big money that poses the greatest concern for voters, but rather media bias. This unexpected finding challenges the narrative perpetuated by the mainstream media, suggesting that the American people are not as easily swayed as previously thought.  The survey, which polled 1,000 voters during the second week of February, shed light on the prevailing sentiment among the electorate. While the specifics of media bias remain unclear, voters expressed a desire for unbiased and straightforward reporting. This sentiment holds true despite the widespread condemnation of the role of money in politics. It appears that voters value fair and impartial coverage more than addressing the influence of wealthy individuals and special interests on elections.  Interestingly, the survey also revealed differences in perspective among those affiliated with different political parties. Republicans displayed slightly less concern about the influence of wealthy individuals and special interests on elections compared to Democrats and unaffiliated voters. However, Republicans and unaffiliated voters were more critical of wealthy special interests compared to wealthy individuals and companies. Democrats, on the other hand, were less likely to believe that the media holds excessive influence over elections.  When given the choice between media bias and large campaign contributions as the bigger problem, Republicans overwhelmingly identified media bias as the greater concern by a margin of 67% to 28%. Conversely, Democrats viewed big money as the more pressing issue, with 57% choosing it over media bias at 34%. Unaffiliated voters were split, with 50% selecting big campaign contributions and 40% opting for media bias.  These findings provide valuable insights into the priorities and perceptions of voters. As the 2022 midterm elections approach, political parties and media organizations would do well to consider the impact of media bias and campaign contributions on public sentiment. The Rasmussen poll serves as a wake-up call, reminding us that the American people demand fair and unbiased reporting in our democratic processes.”X*	  [Watch] Rep. Mike Rogers: Obama's Blame Game on Lack of ISIS Strategy Falls Flat  WASHINGTON â€” In a recent interview, Representative Mike Rogers (R-MI), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, criticized President Obama's handling of the ISIS crisis, contending that the President's strategy of having no strategy is not a believable excuse. Rogers, who has access to classified information that most Americans do not, described Obama's foreign policy as being in "absolute freefall." He pointed to the United States' strained relations with ISIS, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as evidence, and noted that traditional allies are less willing to cooperate due to their perception of weak American leadership.  Rogers dismissed the idea that the Pentagon is at fault for not providing timely options to the White House, a theory put forward by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. "No, I don't [believe it]," Rogers responded bluntly. He explained that various options have been presented to the Obama administration over the past year, tailored to address evolving challenges. However, the President consistently chose to do nothing. Rogers highlighted the requests from Arab League states for American assistance in dealing with a recognized threat, emphasizing that they desired military intelligence and coordination, not American troops on the ground. Faced with a lack of assistance, Rogers claimed that the Arab League states were left with no choice but to take action on their own.  The congressman acknowledged the current efforts to involve global partners in addressing the Middle East situation, but criticized the delay in taking such action. "There is nothing wrong with it other than the fact that it is years late," he remarked. Rogers argued that the problem did not start with the beheading of a journalist, but rather that it was a symptom of a preexisting issue. He contended that Obama's finger-pointing at others ignores the evidence that the President has played a significant role in the growth of ISIS, making it the most significant terror threat today.

Dobbs, a vocal supporter of Trump, introduced Sessions by highlighting the senator's role in Trump's victory and his dismissal of Ryan's comments as a "serious mistake."  During the interview, Senator Sessions emphasized Trump's direct approach in addressing conservative issues such as unfair trade agreements, unlawful immigration, and an overly aggressive foreign policy. Dobbs pointed out that Trump also emphasizes the importance of economic strength in finding solutions.  The conversation then turned to Ryan, with Dobbs expressing his shock at the speaker's reluctance to support the presumptive nominee. Senator Sessions echoed Dobbs' sentiments, noting that Ryan is an influential figure in the Republican Party and should set a good example for Republicans. He expressed surprise at Ryan's change of stance, as the speaker had previously indicated that he would support whoever became the nominee.  Dobbs criticized Ryan for breaking his word, arguing that a leader cannot effectively lead when they do so. He also highlighted conservative discontent with Ryan's stance on spending, as the speaker wants to increase spending rather than reduce it. Dobbs further criticized Mitt Romney, stating that his energy spent battling Trump could have been better used during his own presidential campaign in 2012.  Senator Sessions agreed with Dobbs, stating that Ryan's reminder that he only has one vote does not excuse his reluctance to support the nominee. Dobbs expressed his belief that Ryan's hesitation reflects the reasons why the American people have chosen Trump and voted against the establishment. He questioned whether Ryan is suitable for the position of speaker if he needs more time to process the new circumstances.  In conclusion, Senator Sessions emphasized the need for clear communication, even for the political elites who may choose to understand it."”XŒ	  Title: Experts Offer Divergent Approaches to American Action in Iraq  In a recent interview, renowned television personality Bill O'Reilly shed light on the complex situation in Iraq, accurately describing the country's government as a corrupt mess. He emphasized that defending the Baghdad government should be treated as a separate issue from defending American interests. O'Reilly played a clip where a military spokesperson acknowledged that while the American airstrikes have temporarily disrupted ISIS encroachment on Irbil, they will not have a lasting strategic impact.  Echoing this sentiment, Lt. Col Tony Shaffer concurred that the airstrikes provided only a temporary and localized benefit. Shaffer advocated for a strategy centered on overwhelming force in order to achieve victory or defeat. He expressed confidence in the capabilities of the Kurdish forces, suggesting that they could serve as the boots on the ground in conjunction with air power provided by the United States.  However, Col David Hunt offered a different perspective, questioning the efficacy of bombing as a solution in Iraq. Hunt reminded the audience that over the past twenty-five years, under four different presidents, the United States has resorted to bombing Iraq with little to no success. Instead, he proposed utilizing cruise missiles, drones, and humanitarian relief efforts. Hunt also agreed with Shaffer's assessment that partnering with the Peshmerga, the Kurdish fighting force, would be a sensible approach.  Numerous military experts have voiced similar opinions on the most effective way to tackle the crisis in Iraq. These experts argue that a combination of overwhelming force, in the form of airstrikes or missiles, and support for capable local forces like the Peshmerga could lead to a solution.  As the situation in Iraq continues to evolve, it is crucial that policymakers in the White House consider these viewpoints. The nation, its Constitution, and its traditions are currently facing multiple threats, as recognized by conservative author Rick Wells. It is our hope that the administration takes into account the insights offered by these experts as they navigate this complex and critical issue.  Rick Wells is a conservative author who seeks to raise awareness about the various threats facing our nation, Constitution, and traditions.

In a peculiar moment during the second presidential debate, one fly seemed to recognize the unmistakable scent of untruths emanating from Hillary Clinton and decided to investigate further. It appeared as though the fly had discovered a goldmine of deception, only to quickly realize that it had stumbled upon something far more repulsive â€“ Hillary Clinton herself. Acting on its survival instincts, nature urged the fly to land on her face, but even a fly couldn't bear to remain in contact with Clinton for long.  Fortunately for Clinton, the fly landed on her face while her eyes were shut. Had it approached her open eyes, she may have frozen or resorted to her familiar head bobbing, a sign that she was in dire need of a refreshing drink. However, such an excuse wouldn't hold up as convincingly as it had in the past. It is worth noting that the fly showed no interest in Donald Trump, whose words bear no resemblance to the trademark Clinton brand of deceit.  Clinton should count herself fortunate that her mouth remained closed during the fly's visit, as it likely would have been the most alluring target for her tiny admirer. It's a shame we couldn't witness the spectacle that would have unfolded had the fly chosen to land there. It would have provided Clinton with a genuine reason to call for water or perhaps even display genuine emotion for once.

The Act grants the President the power to order a 90-day military intervention worldwide, renewable for an additional 90 days. According to experts, this timeframe would be more than sufficient to eliminate the ISIS menace. Despite the potential political backlash often associated with military actions, many presidents have involved Congress as a precautionary measure.  Judge Napolitano also emphasized that, under the Constitution, it is Congress' responsibility to declare war. However, the upcoming November election adds complexity to the timing of any military intervention. Sitting idly by is clearly not a viable option. The longer we delay action, the more challenging and costly it will be to eliminate this threat. Smith, seemingly oblivious to the urgency of the situation, advocates for long-term planning, which, according to Judge Napolitano, amounts to inaction and a failure to lead.  It is imperative that President Obama exercises his authority and acts decisively. The ongoing assault on our nation, Constitution, and traditions from various threats necessitates immediate action.

Rawles emphasizes that the extent of the disaster will determine the specifics of the challenges faced, but losing the power grid would undoubtedly be one of the most catastrophic scenarios.  According to Rawles, a loss of electrical capacity could result in a staggering 90% death rate among the population of the United States. This grim statistic is rooted in the fact that almost every aspect of public health infrastructure, including water, sewage, food, and medicine, relies heavily on a fully functioning electrical supply. Without access to these basic necessities, the consequences would be dire.  In terms of geographical considerations, Rawles suggests that being in a town with a population no larger than 500 people would provide the best chance of survival. Larger communities would likely lose the sense of unity and cooperation necessary during such crises, leading to a more individualistic and self-centered mindset.  It is worth noting that this interview, conducted in 2010, remains highly relevant today. The potential vulnerability of America's power grid to an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack or other similar threats is a matter of concern. In a related video, Judge Jeanine Pirro delves further into this issue, highlighting the urgent need for preparedness and protection.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, acknowledges the multiple threats that our nation, Constitution, and traditions face.

With his characteristic blend of humor and facts, Klavan fearlessly tackles the constraints of political correctness that have permeated our society, rendering us unable to distinguish between historical truth and fiction.  The pressure to engage in perpetual self-shaming has become an integral part of college education and popular culture. Men, Christians, and individuals with lighter skin tones are expected to apologize incessantly for the world's problems, ranging from environmental issues to social inequality. Failure to comply with these expectations can lead to public condemnation or media crucifixion, with accusations of bigotry, misogyny, and outdated thinking.  It is worth contemplating why the Christian white male has become one of the most vilified groups in modern times. Is it due to a distorted understanding of history, envy, self-loathing among liberals, or simply a desire to tear down others? This question sparks endless debates and eludes a definitive answer.  Kudos to Klavan for daring to suggest that Christian white men may not be the bogeymen they are portrayed to be. Perhaps they have, in fact, played a pivotal role in the creation of Western Civilization, which has brought immeasurable wealth, freedoms, and technological advancements to millions worldwide. Rather than holding us back, these individuals have been at the forefront of progress.  As a Christian white male myself, I echo Klavan's sentiments and extend my gratitude for the contributions made by our demographic. It is essential to recognize and appreciate the positive impact that Christian white men have had on society.

The plaintiffs, Kashiya Nwanguma, 21; Molly Shah, 36; and Henry Brousseau, 17, allege that Trump's rhetoric and calls to remove protesters incited violence against them.  While it is well-known that billionaire George Soros supports various left-leaning organizations, including Black Lives Matter and Moveon.org, the connection between Soros and the plaintiffs remains unclear. Some critics argue that Soros seeks to control America in order to achieve global dominance, and silencing his opposition, particularly Donald Trump, is a part of this agenda.  The three disrupters made a deliberate decision to interrupt the Trump event, although their motivations are still unclear. Now, they are seeking financial compensation from Trump through this lawsuit, which some perceive as an attempt to gain notoriety. However, it is important to note that their disruptive behavior drew attention and provoked a response from the crowd.  The lawsuit alleges that Trump created an atmosphere of violence, and that his supporters were encouraged to use physical force to remove protesters. However, supporters of Trump argue that his rallies are patriotic and positive, and any violence is a response to outsiders seeking to disrupt the events. Critics argue that it is the Marxists and their followers who are the true sources of violence.  Regardless of the motivations behind the lawsuit, it is crucial to address the issue honestly and for the media and judiciary to handle it responsibly. It must be noted that Trump supporters are mostly law-abiding citizens, and any violence directed towards the disrupters was a result of their own actions. However, it is important to promote civil discourse and discourage any form of violence, verbal or physical.  In conclusion, the three individuals who disrupted the Trump event and filed this lawsuit should be held accountable for their actions. Inciting a crowd and disrupting an event is not a wise or respectful choice, regardless of their intentions. It is crucial for individuals to consider the consequences of their actions and prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone involved.”X«	  In a surprising turn of events, the recent Nielsen ratings have revealed a decline in viewership for the NFL. While it might be tempting to attribute this drop to the first presidential debate, which drew an impressive 81 million viewers, the numbers from the past three weeks indicate a larger issue at hand.  During Week 1, we already noticed a decline in ratings, and this trend has only worsened. Sunday Night Football, featuring the Dallas Cowboys and the Chicago Bears, attracted only 18.62 million viewers and scored a 12.9 rating, lower than the previous two weeks and the same time frame last year. CBS's early-afternoon regional games also experienced an 18 percent drop compared to Week 3 in 2015, while FOX's matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Philadelphia Eagles saw a 1 percent decline in viewership.  The only silver lining for the NFL is FOX's early-afternoon slot, which saw a modest increase of about 3 percent. However, the overall trend is cause for concern.  Many experts and commentators have pointed to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell as the main culprit behind these declining ratings. Some believe that the drop is a result of the league's inferior product on the field, while others take the boycott movement more seriously as a potential reason for the decline. For many Americans, the lack of disciplinary action against Colin Kaepernick following his protest during the national anthem was the final straw. The NFL's perceived leniency towards players involved in off-field controversies has earned it the unfortunate nickname of the "National Felons League."  Furthermore, the league's alignment with progressive values in the face of a more traditional fan base has also alienated some viewers. As more Americans cut the cord and discontinue their cable subscriptions, the fact that most sports are now exclusively broadcast on cable networks has also impacted NFL viewership.  Critics argue that the quality of play has diminished over time, with players prioritizing showboating and self-promotion over the game itself. This cultural shift has reached its peak with incidents like Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the national anthem, which went largely unpunished by Goodell and the league.  In light of these recent ratings, it seems that the NFL is at a crossroads. The league must address the concerns of its fans and find a way to restore their faith in the sport. Otherwise, it risks losing even more viewers in the future.”XÖ  Woman Stabs Boyfriend After Thanksgiving Dinner Mishap  In a grim reminder of the perils that can arise when food is involved, a man in Pennsylvania had a Thanksgiving Day he won't soon forget. Police were called to the scene of a stabbing around 6:30 PM on Thanksgiving Day, where they encountered a distressed 47-year-old woman, Jack-Lyn Blake, making a hasty exit. Without hesitation, she informed the officers that she was responsible for the stabbing. Inside the residence, they found Benjamin Smith clutching a towel against his chest, attempting to stem the bleeding. Smith recounted the events leading up to the incident, explaining that Blake had retired for a nap after consuming an excessive amount of alcohol earlier in the day. Feeling peckish, Smith decided to take matters into his own hands and started indulging in the Thanksgiving feast. It was at this moment that Blake descended upon the dining room, brandishing a knife and giving chase. The frightful pursuit ended with Smith suffering a stab wound to the chest, followed by Blake flinging the knife, which grazed his left eye. Smith was promptly transported to a local hospital, where he received medical attention for injuries that, fortunately, were not life-threatening. Blake, on the other hand, found herself in the custody of Luzerne Country jail, facing charges that included aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, simple assault, reckless endangerment, and making terroristic threats. This, however, was not Blake's first encounter with the law. In May, she had reportedly threatened to murder Smith in his sleep, resulting in her arrest. Subsequently, charges of simple assault, terroristic threats, and harassment were dismissed in June, according to court records.”Xv  EPA Funds Development of Tool to Monitor Hotel Shower Duration  In a new initiative that has raised concerns about privacy, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is investing $15,000 in the creation of a wireless system to track the duration of hotel guests' showers. The EPA claims that this tool is necessary to address the significant amount of water consumed by hotels in the United States and around the world. According to an EPA grant to the University of Tulsa, millions of gallons of potable water are wasted every year due to the lack of individual guest water usage monitoring.  The proposed project aims to develop a low-cost wireless device that can be easily installed in new and existing hotel shower fixtures. This device will transmit water usage data to a central hotel accounting system, allowing for more accurate monitoring and billing. The goal of this initiative is to encourage hotel guests to modify their behavior by providing them with information regarding their water consumption.  Critics argue that this government intervention encroaches on individuals' privacy rights. They also question the necessity of this tool, as hotel showers already have low-flow features in place. Additionally, the grant does not disclose whether the hotel industry requested such a device or how hotels calculate hot water costs per guest.  Tyler W. Johannes, Ph.D., an associate professor at the University of Tulsa's School of Chemical Engineering and a member of the project team, estimates that the average hotel shower lasts 8.2 minutes and uses 17.2 gallons of water per guest. The team hopes to reduce water use by 10 percent or encourage guests to shorten their showers by one minute. They recommend following the guidance of Home Water Works, a project of the Alliance for Water Efficiency, which suggests taking five-minute showers to conserve water.  While the EPA asserts that this initiative is necessary to address water waste, critics argue that it represents a government intrusion into individuals' private lives. The debate surrounding this issue is likely to continue as the development of the wireless monitoring device progresses.”X

  WATCH: Ronda Rousey Responds to Equal Pay Question, Sparking Controversy Among Feminists  Ronda Rousey, the renowned and multifaceted athlete, has once again found herself at the center of a heated debate. This time, the discussion revolves around equal pay for women. While some applaud Rousey for her outspoken views, others, particularly feminists, have expressed their discontent.  The issue was raised during a recent interview when a reporter inquired about the controversy surrounding the pay disparity between the U.S women's soccer team and their male counterparts. Critics argue that the women were awarded a mere $2 million for their victory in the World Cup, while the men received a staggering $9 million despite being eliminated in the first round.  However, Rousey, known for her no-nonsense approach, offers a different perspective. She highlights an important aspect that many on the left seem to overlook - the vast difference in the prize money available for the men's and women's tournaments. The men's prize pool of $576 million vastly eclipses the women's $15 million, making it difficult to draw direct comparisons.  In response to the question, Rousey stated, "I think feminists are missing an important point here." This comment follows previous remarks made by Rousey that some claim were derogatory towards women. When a reporter tactlessly commented on her appearance, suggesting she looked masculine, Rousey fired back, defending her physique and personal values.  "Listen, just because my body was developed for a purpose other than pleasing millionaires doesn't mean it's masculine," Rousey retorted. "I view it as feminine and empowering because every muscle on my body serves a purpose. I am not someone who just strives to look pretty and rely on others for support. I am a woman who embraces personal responsibility and confidence."  These strong statements have drawn both admiration and criticism from various corners. While many conservatives applaud Rousey's stance on personal accountability and her rejection of victimhood, feminists have expressed disappointment and frustration. The clash between these opposing viewpoints underscores the ongoing debate surrounding gender equality and the role of personal agency.  Rousey's unapologetic approach and willingness to challenge prevailing narratives have solidified her image as a strong and independent woman. Regardless of whether one aligns with her views or not, Rousey's candid remarks continue to fuel discussions about gender, power, and the pursuit of equality.”X   Hooters and Islam: ClashDaily Raises Concerns  In a recent post on Facebook, ClashDaily sparked a thought-provoking question: Should Hooters shut down because it is offensive to Islam? This query was accompanied by a story that aimed to shed light on the potential scenario at hand.  Upon conducting a quick search on Bing (opting for an alternative to Google due to concerns about biased search algorithms), it appears that Islamists have remained relatively quiet about Hooters, the American chain of sports bars known for its waitresses selected based on cup size (a qualification the author of this piece possesses, incidentally). However, considering a recent incident in Belgium and the Islamists' inclination to pressure native populations into conforming to their desires, it may only be a matter of time before a female follower of Islam applies for a job at a local Hooters and raises objections about the skimpy uniforms or the presence of bacon, alcohol, or televised sports that they deem a waste of time.   Even without taking Islamic sensitivities into account, many people in the United States have reservations about Hooters. The focus of Hooters is not so much on the food, but rather on the scenery, which stretches the boundaries of Western standards of decency. Those seeking a sports bar experience have numerous alternatives, some of which even boast superior chicken wings. ClashDaily suggests that the concern lies in the possibility that Islamists will target elements of American culture, starting with easy targets like Hooters.   This concern is not unfounded. In July, an Imam in Britain made audacious claims about what would be eradicated from American culture should Islam take over (the complete list and commentary can be found here). Everything that defines Hooters is on that list. Thus, it is only natural that patriotic Americans, such as those who contribute to ClashDaily, are keeping a watchful eye on potential targets for Islamists. A single woman's refusal to wear a headscarf in Europe, for instance, led to a riot.   It is crucial to remain vigilant. Hooters may serve as a symbolic starting point for broader attempts to suppress American culture by Islamists.”Xj  Man Discovers Object Lodged in Arm for Over Five Decades  GRANITE CITY, Ill. â€” Arthur Lampitt, a resident of Granite City, will forever remember the 1963 Thunderbird he was driving when he was involved in a car accident 51 years ago. The memory is not only etched in his mind but also in his body, as part of the car had been embedded in his arm all these years.  Now 75 years old, Lampitt had his hip broken in the accident, which likely caused doctors to overlook the arm injury. Although the arm had been treated for surface injuries, no one realized that a piece of the car had remained lodged inside until Lampitt triggered a metal detector while entering a courthouse about a decade ago.  Following initial confusion, it was revealed that a slender, seven-inch object was embedded in his forearm. Lampitt, upon returning home that day, searched through pictures of the accident and deduced that the missing blinker lever from the Thunderbird was the object lodged in his arm. Remarkably, Lampitt had never experienced any discomfort from it, leading doctors to advise him to leave it untouched.  However, in late 2014, while Lampitt was involved in repairing a house, his arm suddenly began throbbing and swelling, according to his wife, Betty. This prompted Lampitt to take action at the start of 2015, bidding farewell to the lever that had become a part of him for over five decades.  Dr. Timothy Lang performed a 45-minute operation to remove the lever on New Year's Eve. Lampitt expressed plans to do something special with this object that had been with him for so many years.

Stone is urging Trump supporters to gather in Cleveland and stage peaceful protests to make their voices heard. He wants to send a clear message to the political establishment that they will not stand for any attempts to undermine the democratic process. Stone believes that it is crucial for Trump supporters to show up in large numbers to counter any efforts by the establishment to manipulate the outcome of the election. Alex Jones, a prominent conservative commentator, describes this as the most important political action in decades. Jones emphasizes the need for millions of Trump supporters to be present in order to outnumber any opposing forces. While specific details about the protests are not yet available, Stone encourages people to visit his "stop the steal" website for updates. He also assures supporters that Trump is aware of the situation and is taking a firm stance against any attempts to steal the election. In conclusion, Stone and his allies are mobilizing Trump supporters to demonstrate in Cleveland during the week of the convention, with the goal of making a powerful statement about the true strength of the movement.”XA  World's Biggest Mystery May Have Been Discovered: 1492 Santa Maria Shipwreck  In what could potentially be one of the most significant underwater archaeological discoveries ever, explorers may have finally located the wreckage of the Santa Maria, the ship that forever altered human history. Although the need for a thorough archaeological process remains before any definitive conclusions can be drawn, the initial findings have left the team feeling confident about their discovery.  Renowned explorer Barry Clifford, 68, shared his excitement during an interview with CNN, stating, "Every single piece fits. Now, of course, we have to go through the whole archaeological process, and we plan to do that within the next few months, but I feel very confident that we've discovered the site." Clifford has long been fascinated by this particular shipwreck, referring to it as the "Mount Everest of shipwrecks."  This is not the first time Clifford has been involved with the potential discovery of the Santa Maria. Back in 2003, his team investigated a wreck where they came across a cannon. However, Clifford claims that archaeologists misidentified the cannon at the time. Now, armed with new evidence and a fresh perspective, Clifford is hopeful that this time they have truly found the elusive ship.  Archaeologist Charles Beeker of Indiana University is also optimistic about this discovery. He stated, "The ship still has attributes that warrant an excavation to determine the site's identity." Beeker believes that the evidence gathered so far is highly compelling and could indeed confirm this as the long-lost Santa Maria wreck.  The Santa Maria, captained by Christopher Columbus, played a pivotal role in history as it transported him and his crew to the Americas in 1492. If the claim is verified, it would undoubtedly become a monumental moment in underwater archaeology and further enhance our understanding of this transformative era. As we await the results of the upcoming archaeological investigation, the world holds its breath, eager to unravel the mysteries hidden beneath the ocean's depths.”X)   Mother Admits to Abandoning Baby Boy on Stranger's Porch in Ohio  Dainesha Stevens has confessed to authorities that she left her 14-month-old son on a stranger's porch in Columbus, OH on December 28. Stevens cited financial difficulties as the reason behind her decision to abandon the child. The baby's father alerted the authorities after Stevens disappeared with their 14-month-old son, Cameron Beckford, and their 6-year-old daughter, Cheyenne, to Columbus, OH. Based on the information provided by the father, the police deemed it necessary to file a missing persons report. It remains unclear why Stevens was in Columbus, as her residence is in Fredrick, MD. It should be noted that Stevens does possess legal custody of both children.  During the investigation, a detective from Fredrick successfully located Stevens and Cheyenne in Ohio. Meanwhile, authorities in Columbus have initiated a search in a creek located 2 1/2 miles away from where Cameron was abandoned. The reason behind this specific search area is currently unknown, but a dive team is being employed to scour the creek. The police departments in both Fredrick, MD and Columbus, OH are actively engaged in the search for young Cameron. However, authorities have cautioned that the baby may be deceased. Stevens, accompanied by an unidentified male, who was present when she abandoned Cameron on the porch, is now in police custody. Stevens faces two felony charges, including tampering with evidence. A court hearing for these charges is scheduled for Wednesday.   Cameron is described as an African-American child with brown eyes and a Mohawk hairstyle. He was last seen wearing an elephant hat, a black winter coat, gray pants, and red and black shoes. Anyone with relevant information about this case is urged to contact Detective Kidwell at 301-600-7522.”X²   Title: Steve Harvey's Inspiring Message: Embrace Your Unique Gifts and Take a Leap  By [Author's Name]  Steve Harvey, the beloved entertainer known for his quick wit on Family Feud, often goes unnoticed for his profound wisdom. While his recent message to the audience after a Family Feud taping may not have explicitly conveyed this sentiment, it is an underlying takeaway. In a candid video captured when Harvey was unaware of the rolling cameras, he delivered a message that resonates with every American. Perhaps this is a routine practice of his, sharing these words of wisdom after each show.   As a devout Catholic, I admit that the fiery sermon-like delivery, focused solely on the Bible, does not always inspire me as it does those who follow other Christian denominations. However, when Steve Harvey declared, "You have to jump," I couldn't help but agree wholeheartedly. It was precisely what I needed to hear this week.   In order for each of us to fulfill our purpose on this earth, we must take risks and disregard the societal pressures that dictate happiness is contingent upon acquiring certain possessions or a potentially unfulfilling job. True happiness lies in nurturing our souls and having faith that the gifts bestowed upon us will eventually lead to a comfortable existence. We must heed the inner calling and embrace our true selves.   For me, abandoning the confines of my office and pursuing a life centered around creativity in writing, music, and crochet has brought immeasurable joy. Success, as Harvey rightly points out, does not come instantaneously; yet, each small triumph erases the disappointment of the previous day's failures.   Therefore, I extend my gratitude to Steve Harvey and all those who have helped amplify his powerful message. We are not insignificant cogs in a machine; we are unique individuals, each possessing remarkable gifts. Whatever work brings fulfillment and sustenance to people's lives should be celebrated.”Xj  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest faced a difficult task on Thursday as he attempted to address the recent allegations of election fraud and racketeering that have emerged in the Project Veritas videos. However, rather than providing a straightforward explanation, Earnest seemed to deflect and attack the messenger.  In his press briefing, Earnest warned the American people not to take the videos at face value, suggesting that they should be treated with skepticism. He stated, "Despite what the name might suggest, these videos have not often revealed the truth." This response raises questions about the credibility of the evidence presented in the videos, which has resulted in the resignation of two individuals implicated in the alleged crimes.  Bob Creamer, one of the individuals caught discussing voter system racketeering, had visited the White House a remarkable 342 times. While Earnest did not comment on the specifics of the videos, it is worth considering the nature of Creamer's visits. Were they simply innocent conversations about unrelated matters, or could they have involved discussions about illicit activities? These are valid concerns that deserve further investigation.  Earnest did acknowledge that violence and provocation have no place in political campaigns, stating, "We should not have to resort to violence, and in fact, it is completely inappropriate to resort to violence to advance a political goal." This principle is one that President Obama strongly believes in, according to Earnest.  However, it is essential to address the allegations raised in the videos and determine the extent to which they implicate the Democratic Party machinery. By dismissing the videos and attacking the messenger, Earnest missed an opportunity to provide the transparency and accountability that the American people deserve.  The allegations of election fraud and racketeering should not be taken lightly. It is imperative that we investigate these claims thoroughly and ensure that our democratic process remains fair and untainted. The American people deserve answers and the truth, regardless of their political affiliation.”Xû	  Easy Way to Earn $200,000 a Year: The Lucrative World of Cosplay  In a surprising turn of events, the world of cosplay has become a goldmine for those seeking to make a substantial income while having fun. At comic book and science fiction conventions across the United States and beyond, a group of attractive individuals, primarily women but also some men, assemble several times a year to showcase their creativity and entertain fans of superheroes. This phenomenon, known as the cosplay scene, has evolved from a mere hobby into a lucrative profession for a select few. The recent Comic Con in California served as a prime market for these individuals, commonly referred to as "vixens of the Dime novel."  Once in attendance, these cosplayers don skimpy outfits that pay homage to beloved characters, delighting convention-goers in the process. While many engage in this activity purely for the fun of it, some have managed to transform it into a highly profitable career, earning six-figure salaries. Comic book expert Christian Beranek revealed that popular professional cosplayers can make a minimum of $5,000 to $10,000 per show, in addition to per diem and travel expenses. This figure does not even account for the revenue generated through mail order sales, crowd funding contributions, and YouTube ad revenue. Consequently, the top talents in this field are bringing in close to $200,000 annually.  Although being attractive and young certainly helps, these qualities are not prerequisites for success in the cosplay world. A positive body image and a pleasant personality can go a long way in capturing the attention of the crowds. For instance, Maitland Ward, known for her role in Boy Meets World, has emerged as one of the most sought-after cosplay stars. Ward's journey began with a Star Wars-themed photo shoot in 2015, which gained significant traction. Reflecting on this experience, Ward stated, "It was only after the photos came out did I realize how much fans enjoyed seeing me dressed up."  Ward remains tight-lipped about her earnings from these appearances, but she does acknowledge the substantial sums of money that exchange hands at these conventions. She noted that some cosplayers charge $20 to $30 for selfies and the same amount for an autograph. However, Ward personally finds this practice distasteful. In her view, the appeal of a character lies in the authenticity of the portrayal. For instance, Cat Woman would not be seen gallivanting around in a red Jessica Rabbit cocktail dress. Similarly, male cosplayers would”Xô	  Man Spared Felony Conviction in Order to Prioritize Fatherhood  In a heartwarming turn of events, Castor Conley, a 27-year-old husband and devoted father to a 17-month-old baby, narrowly escaped a felony conviction last week. Conley had found himself in court after unwittingly selling a stolen truck, which he had purchased from a thief, to a third party. However, thanks to the shrewd negotiations of his attorney, Conley was offered a deal by the prosecutor: pay the victim $983 and face a misdemeanor charge instead.  Unfortunately, Conley found himself unable to gather the necessary funds, leaving his fate hanging in the balance. It was during a discussion outside the courtroom between Conley's attorney and the prosecutor that a fateful encounter occurred. Colin Murphy, a complete stranger to Conley, happened to overhear the details of the case. Moved by a sense of empathy and compassion, Murphy generously decided to provide the $983 needed to spare Conley from a potentially life-altering felony conviction.  When questioned by reporters about his expectations for repayment, Murphy humbly stated that while it would be nice, he was not concerned about it. His act of kindness was driven by a belief that all individuals, at some point in their lives, make regrettable choices and face the consequences. Murphy expressed a desire for mercy when his own time of accountability inevitably arrives.  Conley's lawyer shared that his client was overwhelmed with disbelief and gratitude upon hearing the news. During the sentencing and his conversation with the judge, Conley even shed a few tears. The true impact of this unexpected act of kindness remains to be seen, as Conley must now prove that he will use this second chance to make something meaningful of his life. Only time will tell if he will rise to the occasion and justify the faith placed in him.  While this heartwarming story resonates with readers, a few key details are still missing. The ultimate test lies in Conley's ability to stay out of trouble and repay Murphy's kindness. Observers cannot help but express concern and skepticism, as Conley must demonstrate responsibility and learn from his past mistakes.  In the end, this extraordinary act of compassion by Murphy serves as a reminder to us all. It underscores the importance of extending mercy to others, especially when we ourselves may one day yearn for it. In the words of Murphy, "All of us sometime in our lives have done something we would rather not have done. And the time will come when perhaps we are”Xí  "Merry Christmas vs. Happy Holiday? Honoring the Birthday of Jesus"  In every corner of the globe, people mark their birthdays, commemorating their special day with joy and festivity. For children worldwide, this occasion holds a particularly cherished place in their hearts. While Christmas may claim the top spot as the most beloved day of the year, one's personal birthday is a close second. In the United States, individuals have the freedom to celebrate their own birthdays as they please. But once a year, the entire world comes together to honor the birth of the most renowned figure in history - Jesus.  Different cultures express their birthday wishes to Jesus in various ways. Some opt for the inclusive greeting of "Happy Holiday," exercising their right to acknowledge the season's broader significance. However, no one possesses the authority to prevent us from proclaiming "Merry Christmas." This is not solely a matter of religious belief; it is about celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.  Numerous families choose to express their well-wishes as "Merry Christmas" while also hoping for a prosperous New Year. Meanwhile, our brave servicemen and women stationed overseas, tirelessly defending our freedoms, yearn to be home for this special season. As we revel in the festivities, it is vital to pause and reflect upon those deployed, imagining their desire to be reunited with their loved ones during Christmas.  I am committed to fighting for the freedom for all individuals to designate this occasion as a "happy holiday." I am prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, if necessary, in defense of our liberty to celebrate the birth of Jesus. With that, I wish a heartfelt Merry Christmas to all of America, and to all, a peaceful night.

In a bid to secure the survival of the nation, these voters are seeking a candidate who not only champions their cause, but also represents a refreshing departure from the political establishment. And in 2016, they have found their hero in none other than Donald Trump.  Matt Continetti, editor of the Washington Free Beacon, provides a compelling analysis of why the people are rallying behind this particular candidate. Continetti highlights Trump's stance on trade, immigration, and foreign policy as the driving forces behind his popularity. Notably absent from this discussion are the social issues that typically serve as a litmus test for conservative voters, as well as the burdensome tax code that has been squeezing the middle class. Continetti's focus lies squarely on the issues that have shaped the GOP establishment, rather than those that resonate with grassroots far-right conservatives.  Trump's support is also seen as a repudiation of the Bush/Romney years, during which the nation invested significant resources in a war that ultimately reignited tribal conflicts in the Middle East and gave rise to the lone wolf movement of jihad. Moreover, the prevailing trade deficit with other nations and the current administration's willingness to compromise American assets in favor of international players have left many Americans feeling vulnerable. The influx of migrants and refugees, who bring with them their own customs and traditions, has further stoked anxieties about the future of Western civilization.  Beyond social conservatism, these are the issues that resonate deeply with American voters, and Trump appears to be the only candidate they trust to address them effectively. Is 2016 truly Donald Trump's election to lose? Only time will tell, but the current momentum suggests that unless the Republican Party establishment makes a grave misstep, he is on track to secure the nomination.”X„   Packing: LGBT Community Defies Obama, Asserts Gun Rights After Orlando Tragedy  In the aftermath of the devastating attack in Orlando, the LGBTQ community is refusing to be silenced and is taking measures to ensure their own safety. Following the tragic killing of 49 innocent individuals who were simply enjoying their night, gays and lesbians across the nation are increasingly turning to firearms for protection. The Pink Pistols, a national gun club for the LGBTQ community, has witnessed a surge in membership, with 2,000 new members joining from Saturday night to Monday morning. This influx has prompted the establishment of new chapters all over the country.  Firearms dealers have also noticed an increase in the number of LGBTQ customers in their stores. The backlog of applications has resulted in hours-long background checks. Mike Smith, a firearms instructor in Colorado Springs, is among the many closely monitoring this sudden rise in gun purchases by gays and lesbians. "I think right now because of what happened, people are looking for answers," Smith said. "You walk into a gun shop and you expect to see people, frankly, who look like me. I think we forget we're a country of all people, not just people who fit that predetermined mold."  This surge in gun ownership marks a departure from the usual stance of the LGBTQ community on firearms. Nonetheless, as they were the target of this tragic attack, it is only natural for them to seek self-protection, just as Americans have done for centuries. Contrary to the calls for stricter gun control laws from the political left, it is encouraging to witness American gays and lesbians taking their safety into their own hands and exercising their Second Amendment rights. Personal safety is of paramount importance, and this response to the Orlando act of terrorism is not what Barack Obama, the United Nations, or any other influential entity anticipated.”Xm
  New Whistleblower Leak Uncovers Classified Details of Obamaâ€™s Drone Program  In a stunning development, a new whistleblower has emerged, shedding light on the classified information surrounding President Obamaâ€™s use of drones. Known as "A Second Snowden," this whistleblower has risked charges of treason and espionage to reveal the truth about the American government's activities.  Edward Snowdenâ€™s infamous release exposed widespread government surveillance, both domestic and international. Now, a new anonymous leaker has come forward, specifically focusing on the use of drones. The Intercept, an investigative news outlet, published a comprehensive report titled "The Drone Papers" on Thursday morning, providing readers with a detailed look into the United States' highly regarded drone program.  "The Drone Papers" reveals a multitude of information about the Obama administration's drone policy. The report includes terminology, the process for selecting targets, the number of casualties caused by drone strikes, and even information from classified studies. PowerPoint slides marked "Secret" outline the development and authorization of targets, shedding light on a previously undisclosed turf war between the Pentagon and the CIA in Afghanistan. The report also highlights the dependence on foreign governments for intelligence information.  According to the expose, before President Obama took office, the United States had only launched one drone strike in November 2002. However, during Obamaâ€™s tenure, the number of drone-related deaths has skyrocketed to over 490 individuals. At one point in Yemen, drone strikes were occurring every six days. This revelation raises concerns about the Obama administration's reliance on drones as the primary method for counterterrorism.  Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, stated, "The drone campaign right now really is only about killing." He goes on to explain that the capture of targets is rare and that the administration is more focused on eliminating them. This shift in strategy has led to collateral damage and lost opportunities for valuable intelligence gathering.  While rumors have circulated about President Obamaâ€™s fascination with drones, little is mentioned about this in the leaked documents. However, it is confirmed that at the start of his administration, Obama learned about drones from the CIA and was convinced to utilize them as a primary tool against Al Qaeda. This decision stands in stark contrast to former President George W. Bush, who had initially resisted the use of drones.  This latest leak has sparked a renewed debate about the Obama administration's drone policy. Critics argue that the emphasis on targeted killings, rather than capturing and interrogating individuals, has hindered the acquisition of crucial intelligence. With this new information in the public domain, the American”X:	  THE NAKED TRUTH: Black Panther Leader Criticizes Democrats  In a time where truth seems elusive, there is something uniquely powerful about its revelation. The naked truth, as some may call it. And there is nothing more heartwarming, albeit bittersweet, than witnessing individuals awaken to the realization that they have been deceived, exploited, and subjected to systemic racism. No amount of persuasion can make someone see the truth if they are convinced otherwise; they must arrive at this realization on their own.  In the current American landscape, an increasing number of individuals with African ancestry, who have endured the dark history of slavery not just in America but also in European countries like England and the Netherlands, are slowly recognizing that they have been used by the Democratic Party. Since the era of Lyndon Baines Johnson and his Great Society, the Democratic Party has leveraged this group to maintain the oppressive systems that continue to marginalize them. This exploitation has also served as a safeguard against potential loss of power.  Amidst this election year, some individuals who have managed to escape the clutches of this repressive system and are not swayed by the messaging of the Black Lives Matter movement are stepping forward to hold the Democratic Party accountable for the injustices they have endured. One such example is Diamond and Silk. Quanell X, a leader of the Black Panther movement, has also joined this chorus of voices, drawn to Donald Trump's direct appeal to the black community. Although we may not agree with the messenger, the message itself rings true.  After eight years of the Obama administration, it is clear that not many Americans have benefitted from the policies that prioritize those in power over the general populace. Americans of African descent are gradually realizing that they were sold a false promise through the Great Society initiative. Now, it is our responsibility to support this community as they navigate their way out of this predicament.  These words bring to mind the wisdom of thoracic surgeon Evarts Ambrose Graham, who famously said, "We owe it to ourselves to seek the truth and support those who strive to uncover it." As we reflect on these powerful words, let us engage in a meaningful dialogue in the comments section and continue to pursue the truth.”•
     XÁ  Rohrabacher: Weakness in White House a Tool for Terrorists  In a recent hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Paul Lewis, the Department of Defense's special envoy for Guantanamo Closure, acknowledged that some Americans have been killed by former detainees released from Guantanamo Bay. Despite the gravity of this admission, the Obama administration dismisses these concerns in its pursuit of closing the facility. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) pressed Lewis on the matter, asking how many lives have been lost due to the reengagement of released terrorists. Lewis declined to answer in an open setting, stating that the discussion should take place in a classified environment. This response did not sit well with Rohrabacher, who sarcastically suggested that the number might be over ten.  The fact that President Obama's policy has resulted in American deaths was then confirmed by Lewis, who acknowledged that there have been fatalities due to actions by Guantanamo detainees. Rohrabacher continued his line of questioning, asking how many more Americans and civilians in Brussels and Paris must die before the administration reconsiders its approach. Lewis avoided providing a direct answer, arguing that the risk of keeping Guantanamo open outweighs the potential dangers. Rohrabacher countered by emphasizing the importance of protecting innocent lives, stating that even if keeping all detainees in Guantanamo saves just one child from being harmed, it is the better course of action.  Rohrabacher also criticized the argument that Guantanamo serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists, suggesting that the perception of weakness in the current administration is a more powerful motivator for extremist groups. He expressed his disgust with this perspective, highlighting the threats facing the nation and the need to address them head-on.   Rick Wells, a constitutional conservative writer known for his candid analysis, shared his thoughts on the matter. Wells believes that the United States, its Constitution, and its traditions are currently under attack from various sources. As someone unafraid to express his opinions, Wells encourages readers to subscribe to his website to receive his posts directly.”XÏ   Obama and Johnson's Comments on Illegal Immigration Raise Concerns  In recent comments made by former President Barack Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, their words, or lack thereof, shed light on their stance regarding the situation at the southern border. Obama referred to the issue as a problem resulting from current laws that require minors who cross the border illegally to be handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). However, some argue that this is not a problem but rather a loophole intentionally created when the law was written.  Both Obama and Johnson carefully chose their words to avoid creating future problems while still pursuing their plan of orchestrating an influx of illegal immigrants from the south. When asked by George Stephanopoulos if their message is for individuals to stay home, Obama responded with a different message, implying that it is acceptable to come to the United States if they avoid dangerous methods like traveling on trains or with smugglers. However, the reality is that those who do make it across the border are often given court dates and released into the country.  Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama has called for a clear statement from Johnson, urging him to inform people that they must not come to America illegally. Johnson, like Obama, evades giving a direct answer, indicating a coordinated effort between the White House and the Department of Homeland Security to allow for an influx of illegal immigrants. Despite being asked multiple times to pledge to send illegal aliens back, Johnson instead repeatedly emphasizes his commitment to enforcing the law without directly addressing the issue at hand.  This pattern suggests a deliberate objective to overwhelm the nation with illegal immigrants, and it appears that DHS and the White House are working together to achieve this goal. The establishment of Homeland Security has provided a means of central control to facilitate this ongoing invasion.”Xê
  Obama's Weekly Address Focuses on Criminal Justice Reform  In his weekly Saturday address, former President Barack Obama discusses his proposed reforms to the criminal justice system, a topic that has garnered significant attention in recent years. As the nation faces economic and social challenges, Obama aims to address the disproportionately high incarceration rates among black and Latino populations.  Obama begins by highlighting the mental health issues and drug addiction prevalent among those behind bars. He argues that these individuals, deemed low risk, could be reintegrated into society rather than remaining in overcrowded prisons. However, it is important to note that each incarcerated individual has been convicted in a fair trial, regardless of their ethnicity.  While Obama emphasizes the need for a fair justice system, some argue that providing benefits based on skin color is inherently unfair. Critics argue that it is unjust to fault the system for effectively catching and punishing perpetrators, or to suggest that sentencing should be based on ethnicity.  Obama acknowledges that the United States has a larger prison population compared to other countries, and believes this is a result of an unfair justice system that needs reform. While he does not explicitly mention it, some speculate that his reforms may include preferences in sentencing for non-white criminals.  Obama contends that incarceration alone does not make communities safer, contrary to popular belief. However, many argue that keeping criminals behind bars does indeed prevent them from committing further crimes. The recidivism rates among released convicts, where they re-offend shortly after release, support this argument.  The former president also seeks to address the underlying causes of criminal activity. He cites statistics that indicate a correlation between higher high school graduation rates and lower incarceration rates. However, he fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by inner-city schools, which often struggle with violence and lack of resources.  Critics of Obama claim that his policies have contributed to a high unemployment rate, particularly in inner cities. They argue that his focus on increasing wages overlooks the influx of low-wage foreign workers and the unemployed. Furthermore, some argue that his reforms may inadvertently benefit gang members and Islamist converts, who they perceive as a threat to the nation.  In conclusion, Obama's address sheds light on his proposed reforms to the criminal justice system. While his intentions are to address disparities and improve outcomes, critics argue that his approach may have unintended consequences. The debate surrounding criminal justice reform continues to be a contentious issue in the United States.”X×   Trump Official Warns of Consequences if GOP Manipulates Nomination  Sam Clovis, a national campaign co-chairman for Donald Trump, recently spoke out about the potential consequences if the Republican Party tries to steal the nomination away from the current frontrunner. In an interview with Alisyn Camerota on CNN, Clovis addressed comments made by Trump regarding the party's attempts to undermine his primary victories.  Mitt Romney, who has campaigned with John Kasich in Ohio and pledged to vote for Ted Cruz in Utah, is seen as a key player in this alleged manipulation. The power elites of the party are accused of aligning themselves with trailing candidates in order to engineer the outcome they desire, disregarding the will of the people who have voted for Trump.  Camerota asked Clovis if Trump stands by his remarks about potential riots and unrest if he is denied the nomination. Clovis simply responded, "Mr. Trump speaks for Mr. Trump."  Camerota then played a clip of Speaker Paul Ryan, who is believed to play a critical role in orchestrating any manipulation of the nomination process. Ryan expressed his disapproval of any suggestion of violence, particularly when it complicates the establishment's plans.  When asked about the threats of violence, Clovis clarified that the actual language used was "riots." He then shared his perspective, stating that he may be selected as a delegate from Iowa to attend the convention, and if so, he would be honored to represent the state and cast his vote for Trump on the first ballot. However, he made it clear that he would leave the convention and the Republican Party forever if the party tampered with the rules and undermined the will of the people.  Clovis's remarks highlight the growing tension within the Republican Party as Trump continues to dominate the primary race. The possibility of a contested convention and the party's response to Trump's success are becoming increasingly contentious issues that may shape the party's future.”X£	  Restaurant Removes Bacon Advertisement to Address Complaints from Muslim Customer  Sneakers Bistro, a local eatery in Winooski, VT, recently found themselves in the spotlight after participating in a community program that allowed volunteers to display messages on signage in recognition of their efforts to beautify the city. However, the attention they received was not exactly what they had anticipated.  The restaurant had adopted a traffic median flower bed in June and decided to place a sign that read "Yield for Sneakers Bacon." This seemingly harmless advertisement, aimed at promoting their breakfast offerings, turned out to be offensive to a self-identified Muslim woman who took to Facebook to voice her complaint.  In an effort to address the issue and show respect for their diverse community, Sneakers Bistro promptly removed the sign. Not stopping at that, they also sent the woman an apology via Facebook and posted a tweet clarifying their intention to focus on serving people breakfast rather than engaging in political discussions.  The decision to remove the sign was not a difficult one, as concerns about safety were also raised. While it remains unclear whether these safety concerns were related to traffic or the potential backlash faced by the restaurant and its patrons, the move to take down the sign was deemed necessary.  Critics argue that such actions are to be expected in a liberal state like Vermont, known for its progressive values and the presence of politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders. They question whether the safety concerns mentioned by the restaurant were genuine or simply an excuse to give in to what they perceive as religious bullying.  Despite the controversy, Sneakers Bistro maintains their love for bacon and eggs, urging people to have political conversations elsewhere. It remains to be seen whether customers will support another restaurant that refuses to bow to what they view as religious pressure.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, expresses his disagreement with the restaurant's decision, believing that yielding to foreign beliefs will lead to the downfall of the country. He encourages individuals to stand up for their rights and beliefs, rather than becoming submissive.  In conclusion, the removal of Sneakers Bistro's bacon advertisement serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by businesses in navigating cultural sensitivities and the ongoing debate surrounding freedom of expression.”X‡   More than a third of refugees in Vermont have been found to carry latent tuberculosis, a potentially fatal infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. Since 2013, around 900 refugees admitted to the state have undergone tuberculosis testing, with 318, or 35.4 percent, testing positive. The highest percentage of refugees infected with TB occurred in 2013, when 43.6 percent of those tested showed positive results. This raises concerns about the screening process for potential carriers of this disease, especially considering that Americans are regularly tested for tuberculosis and may be required to undergo treatment as a condition of employment. However, Ben Truman of the Vermont Department of Health downplayed the seriousness of the situation, stating that the chances of latent infections developing into active tuberculosis are low. The average number of active TB cases in Vermont from 2011 to 2015 was 5.4 cases per year. Nevertheless, the fact that a significant portion of refugees entering the country have latent tuberculosis is certainly troubling, given the potential for the disease to spread. American taxpayers are increasingly frustrated with the idea of funding welfare for refugees who may not fully assimilate into American society, especially when there are additional healthcare costs associated with treating infectious diseases. The issue of refugee resettlement has come under scrutiny following President Obama's pledge to admit 100,000 refugees to the United States. Vermont plans to admit 350 refugees this year, with some potentially being placed in Rutland, where Mayor Chris Louras has faced criticism for not disclosing the city's resettlement plans to the public. It is worth noting that Vermont is not the only state dealing with these concerns, as Arizona has also reported a high number of latent tuberculosis cases among refugees, indicating that this is a worldwide problem.”X‘
  Peaceful Ferguson Protester Charged With Arson; Fellow Protesters Rally to Raise Bail Funds  In an unexpected turn of events, Josh Williams, a well-liked and non-violent protester in Ferguson, has been arrested and charged with arson. Williams is accused of setting fire to a QuikTrip in Berkeley, Missouri, located near Ferguson in North St. Louis County, following the death of Antonio Martin, who was killed in a confrontation with the police earlier in the week.  According to reports from the St. Louis Post-Disgrace, Joshua Williams, a 19-year-old resident of St. Louis, was apprehended by St. Louis County police on Friday. Several local media outlets and store surveillance cameras captured images of Williams attempting to ignite a pile of wood outside the QuikTrip on North Hanley Road in the early hours of Wednesday, Christmas Eve. Williams confessed to his actions in a videotaped interview, as revealed in court documents.  The incident occurred after looters had shattered the glass doors of the QuikTrip during protests against the death of 18-year-old Antonio Martin, who was shot by a police officer at the nearby Mobil station. Surveillance footage from the Mobil store shows Martin allegedly pointing a gun at a Berkeley officer before being fatally shot.  Authorities claim that Williams can be seen in various videos both inside and outside the looted QuikTrip. The presence of surveillance footage and Williamsâ€™ confession seem to provide substantial evidence against him.  Surprisingly, just a day after news broke of Williamsâ€™ arrest, one of the most outspoken local protesters shared a tweet indicating that fellow activists were raising funds to bail out the accused arsonist. The tweet contained a link to the donation page for the Legal Support Fund for Justice for Mike Brown protesters.  While Williams has previously been arrested for charges related to unlawful assembly and other non-destructive offenses connected to protests, this is the first felony charge for property destruction on his record. The news of his arrest has been met with disappointment and disapproval from many peaceful protesters and discussion group members.  Bishop Derrick Robinson of Kingdom Destiny Fellowship International expressed his disappointment, stating, â€œJosh is one of the young activists, and all of us have grown close to him. We have come to know his heart, and he has come to know ours. He is a remarkable and educated young man who is actively involved in the community.â€ However, Robinson acknowledged that Williams had confessed to setting the woodpile on fire outside the QuikTrip, raising concerns among other prominent protesters who are now rallying to bail him out”Xá
  Warning From UK: Sharia Courts Abusive Towards Women  In 1996, the United Kingdom passed the Arbitration Act, aiming to provide citizens with a means to settle certain disputes among themselves without resorting to official courts. The intention was to allow an external court to handle these matters, with the condition that any agreement reached would be legally binding under British law. However, over the past few decades, the growing number of Muslims in the country has led to the emergence of full-fledged Sharia courts, or tribunals, in England. The troubling issue is that these Sharia courts show little regard for British laws, particularly those safeguarding women's rights. One member of the House of Lords, Baroness Caroline Cox, has voiced her strong disapproval. In her recently published report, "A Parallel World: Confronting the abuse of many Muslim women in Britain today," she expresses her concerns about the religiously-sanctioned gender discrimination faced by women and girls in Britain. Baroness Cox empathizes with those who suffer from oppression and abuse, and highlights the discontent felt by many Muslim women who feel betrayed by their adopted country. They believed that coming to Britain would free them from the hardships they faced in their home countries, only to find themselves in a worse situation. Sharia courts have taken advantage of the Arbitration Act, regularly treating Muslim women as second-class citizens. The main issue for Baroness Cox is not so much the freedom of religion, but the lack of awareness among women that Sharia court decisions are not legally binding in Britain. Muslim women, often lacking proficiency in English and knowledge of their rights under British law, are often pressured by their families to use Sharia courts. These courts manipulate and coerce them into signing agreements to abide by their decisions, which are presented as legally binding judgments. This was not the original intention of the Arbitration Act. Unfortunately, it is a tactic frequently employed by Muslim leaders, and it is the women who suffer as a consequence. The report also highlights the alarming extent to which Muslim imams have taken over law enforcement within their communities, often through mosques. Sharia forums, operating out of mosques across the country or through alternative arrangements such as community elder meetings, are seen as authoritative bodies issuing legally binding rulings. Edna Fernandes, a British Indian author and journalist, discovered during her own investigation that numerous imams dispense justice through their mosques, while sharia is informally employed within the Muslim community to address crimes like gang fights or stabbings, thereby bypassing the police and the British court system.”X+
  Title: Gowdy Confronts Church Leader, Yet Fails to Address Homeland Security Secretary  In a recent confrontation, Trey Gowdy, a prominent figure in the fight against illegal immigration, challenged Minerva Carcao, a bishop from The United Methodist Church. Gowdy criticized Carcao for her association with an organization that promotes amnesty for illegal aliens. While Gowdy raises valid points, this exchange seems to be nothing more than political theater that lacks substance.  Although the dialogue aims to portray Gowdy and his colleagues as champions for the victims of crimes committed by illegal aliens, it ultimately accomplishes very little. The real issue lies with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, the person most responsible for the influx of illegal aliens into the country. Gowdy should direct his energy towards challenging the executive branch's complicity in this matter, utilizing the same tone and demeanor he displayed during his exchange with Carcao.  The fact that Gowdy chooses to berate Carcao, knowing she holds no power and is unlikely to face any consequences, reveals his lack of courage. If he were to confront Johnson in a similar manner, it would expose the executive branch's involvement and potentially force Congress to take meaningful action. However, such a move could jeopardize future campaign contributions for Gowdy.  Gowdy's criticism of Carcao's use of generalities and her failure to distinguish between productive members of society and those who pose a threat is better suited for Johnson's attention. Gowdy should press Johnson to specify whether the individuals receiving illegal exemptions from federal law are part of the estimated twelve million illegal aliens residing in the country. This is a question that has long needed to be asked.  It is time for Gowdy to move beyond grandstanding and adopt a more courageous approach that truly serves the American people. Rather than solely targeting individuals on the periphery, he should use his authority and power to hold those responsible accountable. Gowdy must demand that the government adhere to the laws he so adamantly praises, rather than simply pretending to do so.

  States Defy Federal Courts on Same-Sex Marriage  In a striking display of states asserting their rights, four states are challenging federal courts on the issue of same-sex marriage. This clash has brought to the forefront the issue of states' rights, a long-dormant debate that dates back to the founding of the United States.  The battle over same-sex marriage has pitted federal courts against the will of the people in multiple states. Despite the votes by citizens in 21 states to maintain the traditional definition of marriage and ban same-sex unions, federal courts have consistently overridden their decisions.  Last month, Alabama's Chief Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore and Alabama Governor Robert Bentley came to an agreement not to enforce a federal district court's ruling allowing gay marriage. Justice Moore argued in a letter to the governor that the United States Constitution does not grant the federal government the authority to redefine the institution of marriage. Alabama is not alone in this resistance; three other southern states have joined the fight, according to The New York Times.  Republican-controlled state legislatures in Texas, Oklahoma, and South Carolina have introduced bills that would prohibit government employees from issuing same-sex marriage licenses. These bills would also result in the suspension of salaries for employees who continue to issue such licenses, despite federal court rulings deeming these bans unconstitutional. Additionally, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Utah are considering legislation that would allow officials to refrain from participating in same-sex marriages based on religious beliefs.  Even if the United States Supreme Court rules in favor of same-sex marriages in the pending case, the controversy is unlikely to dissipate. According to South Carolina Republican Senator Lee Bright, the millions of people who voted to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman will not simply abandon their beliefs. This ongoing struggle is expected to continue regardless of the Supreme Court's decision.  In November, a federal judge overturned a 2006 constitutional amendment in South Carolina that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, despite being approved by 78 percent of the state's voters. Senator Bright has introduced a bill that would allow government employees to refuse issuing marriage licenses on religious grounds, similar to laws that permit medical workers to opt out of participating in abortions. Some opponents of same-sex marriage draw parallels to the enduring battle over abortion rights that followed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.  This conflict can be seen as a constitutional battle between the 14th and 10th Amendments. The 14th Amendment, originally intended to protect the rights of black individuals after the Civil War, guarantees equal protection under”XÏ	  The St. Louis Police Involved Shooting You Didn't Hear About  ST. LOUIS â€” A week before Christmas, convicted felon Dominic Lamont Irons of St. Louis was paroled. He had been in state prison for violating a law prohibiting convicted felons from possessing a firearm. That would mean that the man already had a criminal record. Later that night, he and a few companions followed a St. Louis City police officer home. What happened next was detailed by Mark Schlinkmann of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:  According to a court document, Irons and the others in the car followed the officer's truck with the intention of shooting him. As the officer parked his truck in the Hyde Park neighborhood and began to exit the vehicle, Irons drove alongside and someone in the car fired shots at the officer. The officer returned fire and Terrell Beasley, an accomplice of Irons, was killed during the shootout. The court document does not specify why the individuals were following the officer and whether they were aware of his law enforcement status. Authorities did not mention whether Irons fired any shots.  The police officer was hospitalized for a week with leg injuries, including nerve damage. As a result of this incident, Irons is currently being held on a $500,000 cash-only bond for a string of felonies, including assault, armed criminal action, unlawful use of a weapon, and second-degree murder in connection with Beasley's death.  It is not surprising that this story did not receive much attention from the mainstream media, as it did not involve racial dynamics typically highlighted in such cases. However, when considering the broader trend of police officers being shot, targeted, and facing open hostility, this incident adds to the growing concern. We should commend these officers for their service.  It is worth noting that city police officers used to be required to reside within the city, but that rule has been relaxed in recent years. Many officers have chosen to move to other municipalities when their children are ready for school. This particular officer, who is African-American, has been with the force for four years and is still required to live in the city.  On a related note, rumors have circulated in St. Louis regarding the shooting of Antonio Martin at a Mobil On The Run gas station in Berkeley. Some suggest that video footage of the incident gives the impression of an ambush, aimed at luring police officers to the scene. However, the police have not confirmed these claims.”XE	  Obama, BLM and Cruz Unite Against Trump in Chicago  CHICAGO â€” In a controversial turn of events, former President Barack Obama, the Black Lives Matter movement, and Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have all joined forces to denounce Republican front-runner Donald Trump. The collaboration was showcased on February 18th at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where a planned Trump rally was abruptly canceled due to escalating tensions between Trump supporters and protesters.  The event, organized by Moveon.org, drew a large crowd of disrupters who effectively filled half of the venue. As tensions mounted, it became clear that the situation was spiraling out of control. Concerns for the safety of attendees prompted the cancellation of the rally. Trump, in a statement, defended the decision, asserting that he did not want to see anyone harmed.  The cancellation of the rally has ignited a blame game, with Cruz accusing Trump of fostering an environment that encourages such confrontations. Cruz's remarks have raised questions about whether he holds other candidates, both Democrat and Republican, responsible for the disruptive behavior of radicals.   The collaboration between Obama and the Black Lives Matter movement has drawn criticism from Trump supporters, who view it as an attempt to undermine his campaign. Obama's praise for the organizers and disrupters of Black Lives Matter has further fueled these sentiments. During a recent gathering at the White House, Obama commended the group for their organizational skills and their ability to create chaos. Critics argue that such praise only perpetuates a climate of destruction.  The choice of Chicago as the location for the rally disruption is seen by many as significant, given the city's historical ties to community organizer Saul Alinsky, as well as its association with Obama and his close advisors. Critics contend that the city's selection underscores a larger agenda to suppress Trump's campaign, which they believe threatens the status quo of racial privilege and white guilt.  Despite the cancellation, Trump remains determined to continue his campaign and plans to reschedule the event. The location, however, may be changed in order to ensure the safety of attendees. As the presidential race intensifies, it is clear that the battle between Trump and his opponents is far from over.”XS   Bobby Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, announced on Tuesday that he is dropping out of the 2016 presidential race. In a heartfelt Facebook post, Jindal thanked his supporters and reflected on his journey as a son of immigrants who rose to prominence in American politics.  Jindal expressed deep gratitude for the opportunity to run for the highest office in the land, acknowledging that his parents' pursuit of freedom and a chance in America ultimately paved the way for his own political ambitions. Growing up in student housing at Louisiana State University, Jindal's parents never could have imagined that their son would serve as Governor of Louisiana or embark on a presidential campaign.  Raised with the belief that Americans are capable of achieving anything, Jindal humbly acknowledged that this is not his time to lead the nation. Consequently, he made the difficult decision to suspend his campaign for President. However, Jindal assured his supporters that he will return to work at the think tank he established a few years ago. There, he will focus on outlining a blueprint for propelling America into what he envisions as the "American century."  Jindal emphasized the urgency of charting a path towards economic growth and victory in the war against terrorism, specifically in combatting radical Islam. Recognizing that the country is currently on the wrong track, Jindal called on Americans to remember that the United States remains the greatest country in history. He urged citizens to begin each day by expressing gratitude to God for the privilege of being American.  While Jindal's departure from the race marks the end of his presidential ambitions, his dedication to the welfare of the nation has not wavered. The New York Times wishes him the best and expresses gratitude for his unwavering commitment to fighting for the United States.”X?  Supreme Court Declines to Review Wisconsin Voter ID Law  The United States Supreme Court chose not to comment on Monday when it declined to review the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision that upheld Wisconsin's 2011 voter identification law as constitutional. This law, passed by Republican lawmakers, aimed to introduce rationality into the prevention of voter fraud, a goal shared by legislatures in numerous other states. However, a judge in Milwaukee declared the law illegal in 2012 following a challenge from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Similar laws in North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas are also facing legal challenges that question their requirement for voters to present a photo ID.  Wisconsin's photo ID law has been a contentious issue since its passage by Republican legislators in 2011. The GOP argues that the mandate is a sensible measure to combat election fraud. Democrats, on the other hand, assert that widespread fraud does not exist and view the law as an attempt to disenfranchise Democratic constituents, particularly those who lack proper identification such as the poor, minorities, and the elderly. However, this argument is undermined by the fact that photo identification is already required to receive state-run social services and benefits.  The Supreme Court's decision not to intervene may indicate their waning patience with the matter. It should be noted that last year, the Court did issue a stay on the law before the November elections, but this was primarily due to the timing of the challenge coinciding with the mailing of absentee ballots.”Xµ	  Russian Bombers Conduct Practice Attacks on U.S. Coast: Is Putin Testing NATO's Resolve?  In a move reminiscent of the Cold War era, two Russian strategic bombers recently carried out practice cruise missile attacks on the United States during a training mission. Defense officials believe that this display was deliberately timed to coincide with the NATO summit in Wales. The Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers were tracked flying across the northern Atlantic near Iceland, Greenland, and Canada's northeast, following a predetermined route that suggested they were conducting practice runs to a launch box - an optimal point for launching nuclear-armed cruise missiles at U.S. targets.  Not only is Russia engaging in saber-rattling, but their actions are also quite brazen. The Tu-95 Bears, Korean War-era turbo prop airplanes, are so loud that submarines can hear them underwater. This is a clear provocation aimed at the leadership in Washington, which has been referred to as a "drained swamp" by some. The prevailing theory is that Vladimir Putin and his group of former KGB members intentionally timed these rehearsals to coincide with NATO meetings. It seems that there is still a Cold War mentality lingering in Moscow, driving these practice drills.  This disclosure of nuclear bombing practice comes on the heels of a Russian general calling for a change in Moscow's doctrine to include preemptive nuclear strikes on the United States and NATO. General Yuri Yakubov, a senior Defense Ministry official, stated that Russia's military doctrine should be revised to identify the United States and the NATO alliance as enemies, and outline the conditions for a preemptive nuclear strike against them.  This situation is reminiscent of the tensions that defined the Cold War era, a period during which the United States and the Union of Soviet and Socialist Republics engaged in a war of proxy conflicts, resulting in casualties and significant financial costs. While it is unlikely that Russia could launch an attack on the entire country from the Labrador Sea, considerable damage could still be inflicted. The Tu-95 bombers are equipped with six AS-15 nuclear-armed cruise missiles, which have a range of over 1,800 miles.  These recent developments raise concerns about the possibility of being dragged into another conflict, one that the United States did not provoke but must now confront. It is imperative that NATO members remain vigilant and united in the face of this threat.”X0	  Kerry: Refrigerators Pose a Deadly Threat, Comparable to ISIS  In a surprising statement made on Friday, John Kerry, the esteemed Secretary of State, compared refrigerators to the notorious terrorist organization, ISIS. While this may seem absurd at first glance, Kerry's comments and actions in Vienna shed light on his concerns regarding climate change and his dedication to the United Nations' Sustainable Development 2030 mandates.  Kerry's mission in Vienna was to further restrict and control the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by amending the 1987 Montreal Protocol. HFCs are commonly found in household appliances such as air conditioners, refrigerators, and inhalers. According to Kerry, these substances are thousands of times more potent than CO2 and contribute to the alarming trend of global climate change.  During his visit, Kerry argued that the banning of certain substances in the Montreal Protocol has inadvertently led to an increase in the use of HFCs, which he now seeks to ban as well. He claimed that the current emissions from HFCs in refrigerators and air conditioners alone are equivalent to the emissions of nearly 300 coal-fired power plants each year.  While some may scoff at Kerry's statements, dismissing them as fearmongering, he believes that taking action against HFCs is of equal importance to combating terrorism. Kerry stated, "What we are doing here right now is of equal importance because it has the ability to literally save life on the planet itself."  Critics argue that Kerry's focus on HFCs is misguided and that there are more pressing issues to address. However, Kerry remains steadfast in his commitment to combating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future. Despite the controversy surrounding his statements, it is clear that Kerry's intentions are rooted in his belief that protecting the environment and ensuring a safe and plentiful food supply are vital for the well-being of all.  In conclusion, although Kerry's comparison of refrigerators to ISIS may seem extreme, it is important to recognize the underlying concerns he is addressing. While some may question his methods and priorities, it is evident that Kerry is dedicated to his cause and believes that taking action against HFCs is a necessary step in combating climate change and safeguarding the planet for future generations.”X_
  Title: FBI Director Reveals Alarming Chinese Cyber Espionage Activities  In a recent interview with FBI Director James Comey on CBS's 60 Minutes, a significant portion of the conversation focused on the Chinese government's cyber activities targeting private U.S. cyberspace. This particular segment of the interview, conducted by Scott Pelley, shed light on the extent and audacity of Chinese cyber espionage efforts.  Director Comey's revelation that China is at the forefront of cyber attacks against the United States was not entirely surprising, given the current state of Chinese relations with the rest of the world. However, what made his statement remarkable was not just the fact that China is hacking, but rather where they are focusing their efforts.  Pelley asked Comey about the countries attacking the United States in cyberspace, to which Comey replied, "Well, I don't want to give you a complete list. But the top of the list is the Chinese." He went on to explain that the Chinese are aggressively and extensively attempting to breach American systems with the intention of stealing vital information for the benefit of their own industries.  The stolen information includes valuable insights into how American companies approach negotiations with Chinese counterparts, among other things. Instead of investing in innovation and creating technology themselves, the Chinese have resorted to stealing and copying others' advancements. This approach disregards the principles of respecting intellectual property and the hard work that goes into creating innovative solutions.  However, despite their efforts, Director Comey mentioned that the Chinese hackers are not as skilled as one might assume. He likened them to "a drunk burglar," clumsily breaking in and causing chaos while stealing whatever they can get their hands on. Their strategy seems to be quantity over quality, believing that by being everywhere all the time, they will be unstoppable.  While the Obama Administration has primarily prioritized domestic issues related to race and immigration, it is surprising that the wholesale theft of American intellectual property has not received more attention. Nevertheless, Director Comey's decision to disclose these cyber espionage activities highlights the seriousness of the issue.  During the interview, Director Comey also emphasized the lack of awareness among the general public regarding the dangers posed by cybercrime and cyber espionage. He noted that people often fail to comprehend these risks while engaging in various online activities such as banking, healthcare, and social interactions, likening the Internet to a dangerous parking lot.  In conclusion, the 60 Minutes interview with FBI Director James Comey shed light on the alarming extent of Chinese cyber espionage activities targeting private U.S. cyberspace. Despite the ongoing domestic priorities of the Obama”X=  Blizzard Triggers Real-Life Hunger Games  In a scenario reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster, a dire announcement is made warning of an unstoppable force approaching. Grasping the gravity of the situation, a family member selflessly volunteers as tribute, preparing for an arduous battle ahead. Clad not in armor, but in boots and a hooded parka, they valiantly march towards their arena - the local grocery store. Once there, this tribute must engage in a fierce competition against others, vying for the essential supplies necessary to survive the imminent blizzard.  To succeed, a carefully crafted strategy must be employed. If fortune smiles upon them, alliances may be formed to aid in their quest. However, more often than not, it is every tribute for themselves in this brutal arena. As the battle commences, all semblance of civility is discarded. Desperation sets in, driving individuals to resort to whatever means necessary to secure the scarce resources. Tempers flare, heated words are exchanged, and physical altercations become a likely occurrence. Time is of the essence, and competitors are frequently eliminated as they succumb to the scarcity of provisions.  The entire spectacle unfolds before a captive audience, as people from distant corners of the nation watch in comfort, witnessing the panic-stricken tributes battling for their meager share of supplies. The victors, upon their triumphant return home, are celebrated for their valor. They have successfully safeguarded themselves and their loved ones from the clutches of death, at least for the time being. However, they are all too aware that this time next year, another family member will inevitably face the daunting trials of the arena. Occasionally, a new volunteer steps forward, relieving the burden on the previous tribute. Yet, on occasion, the same individual who braved the perils before must once again risk life and limb to ensure their family's survival.  To those who courageously volunteer for this real-life Hunger Games, we extend our best wishes: may the odds be ever in your favor.  (Â© 2016 Vianna Vaughan)”X
  Study Finds Environmental Impact of Vegetables Surprisingly High, Puts Lettuce in Crosshairs  Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have uncovered a shocking revelation that challenges the notion of a predominantly plant-based diet. In a study examining the overall impact of our food choices on the environment, the team discovered that lettuce, of all things, is more harmful in terms of greenhouse gas emissions than consuming bacon. This unexpected finding has left proponents of a plant-based diet scrambling to justify their stance.  While there is no argument against the fact that reducing meat consumption is essential for mitigating global emissions, the study highlights the unforeseen consequences of solely adhering to the recommended healthier foods prescribed by the US Department of Agriculture. Even when calorie intake is reduced, individuals who only consume these recommended foods actually increase their environmental impact across all three factors: emissions, water use, and energy costs.  Published in the peer-reviewed journal Environment Systems and Decisions, the study meticulously examined the environmental effects of various food choices. Although it is widely known that plants absorb carbon dioxide, they also require significant amounts of water, especially vegetables commonly found in kitchen gardens. In fact, these vegetables can be composed of up to 50% water when consumed. Professor Paul Fischbeck, co-author of the study and a professor of social and decision sciences at CMU, expressed his surprise at the resource-intensive nature of many common vegetables, including eggplant, celery, and cucumbers, when compared to pork or chicken.  Those with experience in cultivating fruits and vegetables will not be shocked by these findings. The impact of drought on gardens and orchards is well-documented, resulting in diminished yields or even complete crop failure. Furthermore, it is worth noting that vegetables tend to reduce in size when cooked. This begs the question: Is lettuce, with its high resource requirements, truly the environmentally superior choice compared to meat and poultry?  This is not to say that humans should forgo vegetables and fruits entirely. Lettuce, for instance, when paired with extra virgin olive oil, offers health benefits such as lowered blood pressure. However, the notion that a vegan diet is the panacea for saving the planet is proving to be far from reality. The transportation of high water content fruits and vegetables negates the environmental advantages associated with these foods. It seems that the famous question, "Where's the beef?" is now valid in the context of our environmental choices.”XÌ  "IRS Commissioner Faces Scathing Criticism from Congressman Kevin Brady"  In a fiery exchange on Capitol Hill, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas did not hold back in his scathing critique of the IRS commissioner and his agency. Brady, a Republican, vented his frustrations, accusing the IRS of corruption, deceit, and a lack of credibility.  Brady highlighted a litany of grievances, including false promises, failures to comply with or inform Congress, and what he deemed as a general lawlessness within the agency. He made a point to direct his question to the commissioner, asking, "At this point, why should anyone believe you?"  As his allotted time came to an end, Brady did not shy away from expressing his true feelings. He bluntly declared that this current iteration of the IRS is the most corrupt and deceitful in history.  Rick Wells, a conservative author who shares similar concerns about the state of our nation, its Constitution, and its traditions, weighed in on the matter. Wells believes that these pillars of our society are under attack from multiple threats.

Nasheed's action, echoing NFL player Colin Kaepernick's protest against injustice, has ignited a firestorm of opinions. While some view this as a powerful display of solidarity, others see it as a disrespectful act against the United States.  Nasheed, a Democrat, chose not to stand during the pledge, stating that she stands in solidarity with Kaepernick's cause. "I am not anti-America," she emphasized, "and in fact, it is because I love this country that I take this stand." However, her decision to remain seated has drawn criticism, with some accusing her of seeking attention or disrespecting the nation.  The senator's claims of love for her country are contradicted by her list of demands, which some argue align more closely with a solution found in Cuba rather than within the United States. Nasheed's grievances primarily focus on what she perceives as the oppression of black people by white America and the supposed prevalence of racist police officers. Critics argue that many of the issues she cites are either self-inflicted or caused by her own Democratic Party.  For example, critics contend that if individuals refrained from committing crimes or resisting arrest, there would be little conflict with law enforcement. They also argue that the influx of illegal immigrants, facilitated by Democrats, strains resources that could otherwise be directed towards education. Furthermore, voter ID laws, which Nasheed opposes, are seen by some as a safeguard against voter fraud.  Nasheed's claim of unequal pay for women also faces scrutiny. Critics question why, as a state senator, she has not investigated alleged discrimination within her own workplace. Additionally, they question the necessity of her claims, suggesting that if there were legitimate concerns, appropriate channels exist for addressing them.  The controversy surrounding Nasheed's protest highlights the deep divisions within America. While some applaud her for using her platform to raise awareness about injustice, others view her actions as disrespectful and misguided. As the nation grapples with these complex issues, the debate over patriotism and protest shows no signs of abating.”X»
  Elite War Hawks Sound Alarm on Trumpâ€™s Policies - A Close Examination of Financial Motivations  When attempting to decipher a man's true intentions, one should look no further than his adversaries. In the case of billionaire businessman Donald Trump, who has spent the past year challenging the powers that be in the billionaire realm, a clear picture has emerged of his ideological opponents. Those who oppose his America First economic policies have emerged from the shadows, expressing deep concern that Trump's rhetoric may lead to less profitability for their overseas factories when he renegotiates trade deals. Similarly, those invested in green energy have also voiced their apprehension, as they only seem to invest in the sector when government subsidies are available. Now, it is the elite war mongers' turn to raise their voices.  On Monday, The New York Times, now a standard conduit for indirect, yet pointed, messaging, published an open statement signed by 50 individuals who have played an integral role in perpetuating nearly constant warfare over the past 25 years. In this letter, they condemn Donald Trump's reckless foreign policy ideas, which they deem to be in direct opposition to their own. However, a closer examination of Trump's record reveals that these accusations lack a factual basis. The letter, two pages in length, is filled with politically correct euphemisms and repetitive claims that do not hold up under scrutiny.  The signatories of this letter are largely individuals who have found employment in think tanks, lobbying firms, and vested private industries, all while capitalizing on their involvement in administrations that have engaged in warfare. Many of them served in the Bush 43 administration. While some names may ring a bell for the average citizen, such as former heads of the CIA or Homeland Security Secretaries, the majority were deputies within the defense and intelligence apparatus and the State Department. This indicates that their livelihoods are dependent on their association with a government engaged in war.  One of Trump's consistent messages on the campaign trail has been his aversion to unnecessary wars and the need for fiscal responsibility. He has expressed a desire to reassess America's military alliances, including NATO, and address the reality that the United States cannot continue to bear the burden of funding other countries' defense.   Upon closer examination, a common theme emerges: finances, economics, cash, and personal gain. Trump's main focus is on putting America first in every decision, be it trade deals, military action, or foreign policy. He insists on considering the impact on the country's well-being, both financially and in terms of human life,”XÏ  Hillary Clinton: A Clear Example of a Corrupt Government System  In a stunning display of the flaws within our government, Hillary Clinton has managed to evade any consequences for her actions. Despite the mounting evidence against her, she remains unscathed, leaving many citizens concerned about the state of our democracy. It seems that our government is swayed by forces other than those of the people, leading to a deeply divided nation.  This issue is not new; it has been present since the days of Athenian democracy. The founders of our country recognized this and warned against factions that would use division to undermine liberty. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing this unfold before our very eyes. Justice is being used as a distraction by social activists and the media, diverting attention from the real issues at hand. Our culture is plagued by shallow thinking, and any arguments against the FBI, DOJ, and Attorney General's failure to indict Clinton are quickly dismissed as racism or sexism.  The powerful forces supporting Hillary Clinton are formidable, but history has shown that her behavior is a weakness. The Clinton camp underestimated the number of Americans who would rise up against her and the globalist cartel funding her campaign. This arrogance on the part of the DNC is astounding. They believed they could manipulate the entire election without consequence. They were wrong. Countless Americans are opposed to Clinton and her cronies, despite what the mainstream media may suggest. The voices of concerned patriots can be heard through platforms like Wikileaks, the blogosphere, and vlogs, revealing the true nature of Clinton and her allies. This nation has reached its breaking point and demands change.”XŠ  Four U.S Cities Among the World's Most Violent; All Share Striking Similarities  A recent study conducted by the Citizens Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice has shed light on an alarming trend in American cities. The study aimed to identify the most violent cities in the world, and the results revealed that four American cities made the list: Detroit, Michigan; New Orleans, Louisiana; Baltimore, Maryland; and St. Louis, Missouri.   Upon closer examination, it became evident that these cities were not randomly selected. They shared some astonishing similarities that provide valuable insights into the root causes of their high crime rates.   First and foremost, all four cities had over 22% of households living below the poverty line. This economic instability has undoubtedly contributed to the challenging circumstances faced by residents.   Another striking commonality was that over 50% of households in these cities were led by single parents. This growing trend reflects a broader societal issue, with the African American community experiencing a concerning 72% rate of out-of-wedlock births.   Perhaps the most revealing common factor among these cities is their political leadership. Each of the four cities listed in the top 50 most violent cities in the world has been under Democratic rule. Baltimore and Detroit have not had a Republican mayor in over 40 years, while St. Louis has been governed by Democrats for 60 years. New Orleans has suffered from failed liberal policies for a staggering 140 years.   Coincidentally, New Orleans has the third-highest percentage of young adults, aged 16 to 24, who are neither employed nor enrolled in school. This statistic underscores the long-term consequences of ineffective policies and highlights the urgent need for change.   Setting aside the contentious debate surrounding gun control, it is undeniably clear why crime and poverty persist in these cities. The evidence is right here, presented in black and white. How many more young lives must be lost before liberal Democrats acknowledge the failure of their ideas?   Sources: - Citizens Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice - City-data.com”X$
  [Video] Hilarious Tribute to Hillary Clinton Shows the Absurdity of Political Propaganda  In a tribute video to Hillary Clinton, viewers are treated to what can only be described as comedic genius. One might assume this video is a satirical take on Clinton by a conservative, but it is, in fact, genuine. I challenge anyone to watch this video without cracking a smile. Personally, I found it to be one of the most laughable attempts at propaganda I've seen in a long time. The fact that some people could take this seriously without bursting into laughter speaks volumes about the state of our educational system, American politics, and Western Civilization as a whole.  The Stand With Hillary PAC aims to engage Latino voters and working families in anticipation of a potential Hillary Clinton presidential run. However, if they believe this video will accomplish that goal, they are sorely mistaken. Throughout the entire video, there isn't a single accurate characterization of Clinton, except for the fact that she is someone's daughter and a mother. That's about it. This feeble attempt at portraying a wealthy, habitual liar who hasn't driven a car in two decades as a down-to-earth, family-oriented politician is not only ridiculous but also insulting. Do they truly believe we are all so gullible?  Thankfully, the YouTube comments section is disabled, sparing us from a barrage of mockery. And I must disagree with the claim that Clinton is like the women in my life. She is certainly not.   According to the website SWH2016.com, the goal of the Stand With Hillary PAC is to amplify the voices of ordinary Americans who feel disillusioned by the negativity in politics. They ask for support by sharing positive facts and stories about Clinton. They believe that together, we can drown out the constant stream of negative attacks with the uplifting positivity that defines Americans.  The website is filled with short, simplistic paragraphs seemingly aimed at a second-grade audience. Despite the economy improving, working families still struggle. Clinton, however, understands the need to do more for the backbone of our country. She refuses to settle for mediocrity when we have the potential to achieve so much more. As First Lady, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State, Clinton has consistently fought for a strong America built on strong families and communities.  The 2016 Presidential campaign season is already underway, and we can expect to see more of these types of propaganda videos emerge. If this is the best the Hillary camp can offer, they are already in serious trouble.”XX
  Audience Member Faints at Obama Campaign Rally, Prompting Questions about His Potential Run for President  As speculation mounts about whether Barack Obama will make a bid for the presidency once again, two telltale signs have emerged. First, he has hit the campaign trail, actively engaging in political events. Second, we are witnessing a resurgence of staged fainting incidents at his rallies. In the past, it was not uncommon to see seemingly random women collapse, supposedly overwhelmed by the elements or Obama's magnetic persona. The use of actors pretending to be ordinary liberals attending an Obama rally, feigning fainting spells on cue, was met with widespread mockery. Consequently, Obama scaled back this practice. However, with his potential third term on the horizon and Hillary Clinton's physical health and polling numbers deteriorating, Obama and his supporters are pulling out all the stops. Despite the obviousness of the tactic, if it worked before, Obama will not hesitate to employ it again. It seems that shame is not part of his vocabulary.  Traditionally, the recommended treatment for a bout of "Obamasitis" has been the delivery of water by emergency medical technicians (EMTs). This advice still stands, according to experts. The audience is also encouraged to repeatedly bend their legs, a technique Obama picked up from Richard Simmons, as it helps improve blood circulation. Clinton attempted this maneuver on Sunday but was unsuccessful, as her legs seemed to malfunction. However, it should be noted that she did not have Obama coaching her. In response to an audience member who fainted, Obama calmly announced to those in charge, "We have somebody who fainted. This is what happens; they'll be okay." Evidently, fainting is a common occurrence when exposed to Obama for even brief periods of time. It appears that some individuals have a lower tolerance for what they perceive as deception and falsehoods. Obama advises giving these individuals some space and encourages everyone to bend their knees but avoid locking them.  Obama is no stranger to this type of performance. He, along with other practitioners of deception, often referred to as magicians, has employed these tactics for years. He typically calls upon a random audience member, whom he has never met before, to enhance the authenticity of his act. While these individuals may be familiar to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), as they were carefully selected and hired by the organization, Obama himself likely has no prior knowledge of them. These actors have a twofold role: to reinforce the greatness of Obama to the world and to convey”XH
  Title: Concerns of Election Security Emerge Amidst Claims of Rigging  In recent weeks, Republican nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his concerns about the integrity of the upcoming election. While some of his allegations stem from the contentious Democratic National Committee (DNC) primary, where instances of fraud and corruption against Bernie Sanders were exposed, others focus on disruptive tactics employed during his own rallies. Trump has even drawn comparisons to Hitler's rise to power, highlighting what he perceives as an orchestrated attempt to discredit him.   Adding to these concerns, President Obama's denial of any rigging only serves to fuel Trump's apprehensions. Trump, a self-proclaimed protector of American values, has long criticized Obama's credibility as a "pathological liar." Consequently, Trump argues that if Obama asserts the system is secure, it is likely the opposite is true, leaving it vulnerable to those seeking to undermine the nation.   A video brought to our attention by a reader further amplifies these concerns. Though the date, location, and participants remain unknown, the video captures an individual who claims to be a local election official testing the reliability and accuracy of Diebold voting machines. The alarming discovery made in the video reveals just how easily these machines can be manipulated through a simple alteration of the activation card, potentially compromising the integrity of any election dependent on their use.   The individuals involved in the video appear to be diligently conducting their test with the aim of ensuring accurate results. Given the nature of their profession as election officials, tasked with safeguarding the voting process, it is reasonable to assume they possess the necessary expertise to conduct such an evaluation.   The implications of this video are profound. Observers have noted a stark contrast in crowd sizes between Trump's rallies and those of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. While Clinton's media and entertainment industry allies claim she maintains a lead, Trump's promises to reverse the perceived decline of America under Clinton and Obama's leadership resonate with many. Furthermore, his accusations of Clinton's alleged criminality and disloyalty to the nation only add fuel to the fire, undermining the credibility of any polls or media narratives that suggest her dominance.   As the general election approaches, it becomes increasingly apparent that the American people are being manipulated. The primary season already showcased irregularities, such as unexpected turnout figures and curious vote tabulations in states like Wisconsin. This raises concerns that a similar attempt to manipulate the final outcome of the election is imminent. Trump contends that our government, composed of individuals he labels as criminals, is prepared to hijack the election.”XH  Gowdy: Clinton May Have Covered Herself in Cheryl Mills Immunity Deal  In an interview with Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC), Bret Baier of Fox News begins by playing a clip of Robby Mook, a campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, attempting to downplay the significance of the email cover-up. Mook's statements, which echo the false claims made by FBI Director Comey, are met with skepticism by both Baier and Jake Tapper.  Gowdy, however, offers a more informed perspective on the matter, asserting that the State Department is complicit in the cover-up. He highlights the fact that Clinton maintained her arrangement for her entire tenure at the State Department and for nearly two years thereafter, with the truth only coming to light due to the persistence of the Benghazi committee. According to Gowdy, the State Department has been shielding Clinton since she left office.  The discussion then turns to the perplexing immunity deal given to four Clinton staffers and an outside contractor who destroyed evidence. Gowdy questions the logic behind this agreement, arguing that if there was evidence relevant to the investigation, a subpoena should have been issued rather than granting immunity. Furthermore, he notes that the attorney for two of the staffers claimed that the Department of Justice assured her clients that they had done nothing wrong. Gowdy finds this assertion dubious, as individuals who have committed no wrongdoing typically do not seek immunity.  Gowdy suggests that the motive behind offering immunity to Cheryl Mills, who had classified information on her computer, was to protect Clinton. He argues that if Mills is granted immunity for having classified information on her computer, it becomes impossible to prosecute Clinton for the same offense. Gowdy offers further insights and ideas on the matter.

  Foreign Governments Exploit Tax Reporting Loophole to Influence U.S. Lawmakers  A recent investigative report by The New York Times has shed light on the concerning practice of foreign governments utilizing non-profit organizations known as 501(c)(4)s to gain influence with U.S. lawmakers. Under current non-profit tax reporting laws, major donors to these organizations are allowed to remain anonymous in exchange for forfeiting tax credits. This loophole has been exploited by countries such as Japan, Norway, China, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and others, who are effectively using think tanks as lobbying firms, as direct influence with Congress is prohibited for foreign governments.  This revelation should be deeply troubling to Americans. The prohibition on foreign governments lobbying Congress exists for good reason - to ensure that our elected representatives prioritize the interests of the American people and the states. While it may be gratifying to see that the United States still wields enough influence to prompt other governments to seek our alignment, our government's primary duty is to serve its own citizens, not foreign powers.  The New York Times article also highlights the concerning flow of money to various think tanks. The report identifies nine out of twenty-eight think tanks that have received substantial funding from foreign governments. The sources of funding are diverse, with money pouring in from various regions around the world. It is evident that foreign governments see these financial contributions as investments rather than mere research funding. Through these arrangements, foreign officials aim to gain influence in the crowded Washington landscape, where numerous nations compete for attention from the U.S. government.  The nature of these relationships varies. Some countries engage directly with think tanks, establishing contracts that outline the scope and direction of research. Others provide donations to the think tanks and hire lobbyists and public relations consultants to advocate for their interests. These actions involve pushing foreign agendas within our own government. It raises questions about the impartiality and objectivity of think tanks, which are often seen as bastions of academic neutrality. Are they compromising their research and prostituting themselves for financial gain?  Currently, 501(c)(4)s are not obligated to disclose the amount of revenue they receive from foreign sources. However, in response to The New York Times report, a proposed rule change has been introduced in the House that would require think tanks to disclose their sources of foreign funding when testifying before Congress. While this is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough. Congress should pass legislation that subjects contributions from foreign governments and foreign nationals to the regulations outlined in the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  It is clear that urgent”X¦  5 Surprising Facts About Melania Trump  Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, stepped into the limelight last night as she delivered a speech to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. However, as soon as she left the stage, critics wasted no time in searching for ammunition to criticize her. Yet, there are several lesser-known facts about Melania that might surprise you.”Xc	  Michele Bachmann, the former Minnesota Congresswoman and staunch critic of President Obama, has recently voiced her concerns about the current state of American politics and the potential consequences of the upcoming election. In a recent interview, Bachmann stated that she believes Obama has been working towards a "fundamental transformation" of the country and that he is nearly 80 to 90 percent complete in achieving his objective. She argues that he still aims to undermine the First and Second Amendment rights of American citizens before leaving office.  Bachmann also expresses her fears about the future if Hillary Clinton were to be elected as President. She likens Clinton's role to that of a dressmaker adding finishing touches to the "completed product" of Obama's transformation. According to Bachmann, this transformation is not limited to the United States alone. She points out that the Middle East is experiencing drastic changes, and Europe is currently facing a major influx of immigrants. Bachmann suggests that these global shifts are part of a larger plan, orchestrated by Obama and others, to create a global caliphate.  Furthermore, Bachmann argues that Obama's economic policies align with those of a Marxist ideology. She believes that Canada, under Prime Minister Trudeau, is now following a similar path, and that Mexico has long adhered to this political model. Bachmann asserts that these countries, along with the United States, are moving toward a North American Union that closely resembles the European Union. She warns that the rise of radical Islam is also a significant concern, as both Obama and Trudeau have displayed a pro-Islamic stance.  Bachmann emphasizes the importance of the upcoming election and calls on the Church to actively participate. While she acknowledges that Donald Trump may not be the ideal candidate, she suggests that he may be the one chosen by God to defeat Clinton. For Bachmann, this is reason enough to support Trump.  In conclusion, Michele Bachmann's concerns about the current state of American politics and the potential consequences of the upcoming election highlight her belief in a "fundamental transformation" orchestrated by President Obama. She argues that the future of the United States, as well as global politics, hangs in the balance, and urges the Church to play an active role in shaping the outcome of this election.”XÐ  In a recent incident involving Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, conservative radio host Michael Savage argues that the woman at the center of the controversy, Michelle Fields, is a "fake reporter" who had been let go by Breitbart after her claims were investigated. Savage questions why Trump has not filed charges against Fields after watching video footage of the incident. However, he suggests that Trump is better off not pursuing legal action due to potential backlash from women voters and those who may use false accusations against him. Savage criticizes the Secret Service for allowing Fields to get close to Trump, posing a potential threat. He also brings up a previous incident in which Fields made similar claims against the NYPD during the Occupy Wall Street protests, accusing her of trying to make herself the story. Savage mentions a Daily Mail report that details how Fields had been warned twice by an anonymous Secret Service agent to stay away from the candidate. Despite this, she allegedly made contact with Trump and continued to do so even after being told to stop. Savage argues that the Secret Service agent is the one who should be fired for failing to protect Trump. He highlights the potential danger Fields posed, suggesting she could have been a terrorist. Savage asserts that Lewandowski did the right thing by intervening to protect Trump and suggests that the charges against him may be politically motivated, possibly influenced by Ted Cruz or the Democratic Party. Savage compares this incident to the lack of indictments for Lois Lerner, Hillary Clinton, and Wall Street insiders who have allegedly committed real crimes. He concludes by expressing his belief that the system is corrupt.”X9
  Opinion: Controversy Surrounds Obamas' Separate Jumbo Jets for Los Angeles Travel Day  In a recent media appearance, Greta and a small panel expressed their outrage over former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle's decision to take two separate planes for their travel from Washington to the Los Angeles area and back in the same day. This move has reignited the long-standing debate surrounding the expense and environmental impact of the Obamas' vacations.  The panel questioned Michelle Obama's choice of not stopping in Arizona during their travel. Speculations arose regarding possible underlying reasons for this decision. However, it is important to note that the Obamas have historically used two planes for their travel, which effectively amounts to three planes being used. Critics argue that this contradicts the former president's reputation as an advocate for environmental sustainability.  The panel further highlighted the frustration of American taxpayers awaiting answers regarding the expenses incurred by the Obamas' travel choices. The carbon footprint left by their travel has also raised concerns, considering its size surpasses that of many countries. Critics argue that this contradicts Obama's green agenda, as his carbon footprint seems disproportionately large.  The controversy surrounding the separate planes used by the Obamas has prompted discussions about their relationship, with some suggesting that their decision to travel separately may indicate a strained dynamic between the couple. This sentiment is echoed by those who believe that this incident epitomizes a larger issue of overindulgence and entitlement.  Critics argue that the Obamas' actions reflect a pattern of excessive behavior, with some drawing parallels to the adage "give them an inch and they will take a mile." This incident, they argue, may serve as a wake-up call for the rest of the country to understand the true nature of the Obamas' character.  It is essential to address the racist undertones that often accompany discussions about the Obamas. While some critics resort to derogatory language, it is important to consider the impact of these racially charged comments. The protection afforded to President Obama by the liberal media, coupled with the fear of being labeled racist, has created a hesitancy among individuals, especially white Americans, to voice their concerns openly.  In conclusion, the controversy surrounding the Obamas' separate jumbo jets highlights the ongoing debate surrounding their vacation choices. Questions about expense, environmental impact, and their relationship have emerged, with critics arguing that these incidents contradict the image of a green president and reveal a pattern of excessive behavior. However, it is crucial to address the racially charged language used by some critics, which undermines legitimate”Xë  "Hillary Clinton's Address at Temple University Raises Questions About Her Health"  In a recent speech delivered at Temple University in Philadelphia, Hillary Clinton captivated a crowd of students. However, observers couldn't help but wonder if attendees were genuinely interested in her message or merely hoping to witness any peculiarities, such as a potential collapse or seizure. Speculations even extended to the possibility of her experiencing a sudden halt, a common occurrence when disruptions arise. Could she exhibit a new anomaly, like eyes that wander in different directions simultaneously?  While Mrs. Clinton has been characterized as possessing a reptilian quality and frequently holding contradictory positions, her internal conflicts are not usually as visibly pronounced to the general public. Her ability to adapt like a chameleon typically remains confined to the symbolic realm of politics. Yet, it appears she may have developed an uncanny skill of independently moving her eyes. Undoubtedly, her adept storytelling abilities will likely attribute this newfound talent to secret private training during her recovery from a bout of dehydrated pneumonia allergies.  Observers speculate that Clinton's reaction or side effects from her undisclosed and non-existent medical condition might be causing these manifestations. As time goes on, these symptoms gradually emerge, making it increasingly challenging to conceal them from the public eye.

However, the community has come together to support the investigation, raising approximately $30,000 in rewards. This money is now being offered for any information that leads to the arrests in the fatal shooting of Texas sheriffs deputy, Sgt. Craig Hutchinson, at his Austin-area home.  In addition to the funds raised locally, the Texas Crime Stoppers program has announced a $15,000 reward for any information that leads to suspects in the killing. Sgt. Hutchinson was gunned down early Monday in Round Rock after reporting prowlers in his yard using his law enforcement radio. He was set to retire in September after serving on the force for 32 years. Unfortunately, he later succumbed to his wounds at a local hospital.  During a news conference on Monday, Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton spoke fondly of Sgt. Hutchinson, referring to him as his field training officer and expressing his personal connection to the case. "He was my field training officer," Sheriff Hamilton said. "So this is near and dear to me. This guy was a big teddy bear and everybody loved him. He was a gentle bear and he taught me everything I knowâ€¦I loved that guy to death."  The reward from Texas Crime Stoppers, which operates within the office of Governor Greg Abbott's Criminal Justice Division, is joined by a $10,000 reward from the U.S. Marshals Service. Additionally, Judge Kevin Madison, a municipal judge and former employee of the sheriffs office, has pledged a $5,000 reward for any information that leads to arrests.  On Monday night, dozens of mourners gathered for a vigil for Sgt. Hutchinson, praying and holding hands in his memory. If anyone has any information about this case, they are urged to contact any Austin area Police Department. Authorities have assured that the identities of those who come forward will remain confidential. Co-workers and neighbors of Sgt. Hutchinson have described him as a friendly and caring officer who always went out of his way to help others.  (Information from Fox News was used in this report.)”X$
  Anti-Trump, Anti-Hillary Merchandise: One of These is Dominating Sales  In the midst of a closely contested race for the presidency, it seems that one candidate is gaining an overwhelming advantage in the merchandise market. According to a recent poll conducted by CafePress, a popular online retailer, anti-Hillary merchandise is outselling anti-Trump merchandise by a staggering 814.88 percent. This significant margin is even more impressive considering that sales of pro-Trump products are also being surpassed by the anti-Hillary gear.  The sales figures are particularly noteworthy due to the fact that they do not involve any official campaign merchandise. Instead, the products sold on CafePress are primarily designed by users themselves, reflecting the sentiments of everyday Americans. Unlike traditional pollsters who rely on landline calls to contact likely voters, this t-shirt poll captures the passion and enthusiasm of a highly engaged electorate. CEO Fred Durham believes that these passionate individuals will show up at the polls on Election Day, making their voices heard.  The surge in sales of anti-Hillary merchandise is a clear indication that there is a significant portion of the population who vehemently opposes the Democratic nominee. This sentiment may be further fueled by recent reports of Trump supporters facing aggression and intimidation when expressing their support in public. It appears that these individuals are seeking alternative ways to voice their opinions, turning to merchandise as a means of showing their allegiance.  The sales figures also reveal that this election is generating even more interest than previous ones. In fact, sales in 2016 are reported to be 50 percent higher than they were in 2012. This suggests that the American people are increasingly engaged and invested in the outcome of this election. The t-shirt poll serves as a testament to the passion and intensity surrounding this race.  While the national media continues to portray the race as competitive, the overwhelming sales figures for anti-Hillary merchandise indicate that a significant portion of the population simply cannot support her. Whether it is due to a constant stream of negative information or a general dissatisfaction with the Clinton brand, the sentiment against her is undeniable. In this particular poll, Trump emerges as the clear victor, showcasing his popularity among a passionate segment of the population.  As the election draws near, it will be interesting to see if these sales figures translate into actual votes. The individuals who purchase these products demonstrate a level of commitment and dedication to their chosen candidate. It remains to be seen whether this enthusiasm will translate into electoral success for Donald Trump or if Hillary Clinton can overcome this significant opposition.”Xí   Article Title: Obama's Speech at Howard University Reveals Racial Agenda and Urges Action  In a rare instance, former President Barack Obama's recent speech at Howard University's commencement deserves our attention, as his words shed light on his racial preferences and agenda. Obama initially jokes about being thrilled to receive an honorary degree, but quickly shifts into a celebration of blackness. He emphasizes that there are various ways to embrace black identity, including sexual expression. Obama claims that any action performed by a black person automatically becomes a representation of black culture, going as far as mentioning stealing boxes of Swisher Sweets from convenience stores as an example.   Furthermore, Obama asserts that black people are united by their awareness of injustice and struggle, carefully alluding to white privilege and bigotry. However, he conveniently overlooks the Democratic Party's historical opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and its ties with the Ku Klux Klan, as well as the Republican affiliation of Abraham Lincoln. By selectively omitting certain aspects of history, Obama perpetuates a biased narrative.  Adopting a South Carolina preacher accent, Obama, a community organizer, urges the graduates to reject a sense of entitlement, contradicting his earlier statements. He questions why a wealthy society like ours allows homelessness to persist, insinuating that the government should expand social programs to create a nanny state. Obama also promotes his criminal justice reform agenda and encourages the graduates to engage in community organizing.  It is important to recognize the implications of Obama's speech.

Despite efforts by plant workers to cool the reactors, explosions occurred, causing meltdowns in at least three reactors. As a result, radioactive chemicals and water used to cool the fuel rods leaked into the ocean, leading to further contamination.  Although the plant has been decommissioned, the cleanup process is still ongoing and is expected to take decades to complete. In 2013, Canadian oceanographers reported the presence of cesium-134 off the shores of Vancouver Island. Cesium-134 is an isotope with a short half-life that is used in nuclear development.  Earlier this week, oceanographers detected levels of cesium-134 roughly 100 miles off the northern coast of California. However, they assure the public that these levels are well below any measurable health risk. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution stated on its website that the detected radioactivity off California's coast is more than 1,000 times lower than the acceptable limits set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water.  Ken Buesseler, a marine chemist leading the analysis, explained that even if a swimmer were to spend six hours a day for a year in water with 10 Bacquerels per cubic meter of cesium-134, they would still receive 1,000 times less radiation than from a single dental X-ray. Buesseler emphasized that the detected levels do not pose a public health threat, but he acknowledged the challenges that remain in the last 100 miles of the affected area.  The operator of the Fukushima plant stated in an email that the spread of radiation had been anticipated and that significant improvements have been made to water management at the site since the accident.  While concerns about the potential impact on the food chain and the need for continued testing persist, it is crucial to rely on accurate information. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assessment provides reassurance regarding the safety of the water off California's coast.”X

  Title: Protester's Reckless Act Highlights the Need for Personal Safety Awareness  In a recent incident involving a Black Lives Matter (BLM) protester, we are reminded of the importance of personal safety precautions. While this individual's intentions were rooted in their fight for justice, their decision to stand in the middle of a busy street at night proved to be a dangerous choice. This unfortunate incident highlights the need for individuals to prioritize their own safety, even in the pursuit of a cause.  The protester's actions can be seen as a result of a misguided sense of entitlement and a lack of awareness regarding the priorities of others. When individuals grow up believing that the world revolves around them, they may fail to recognize that others have their own lives to consider. The self-absorbed nature of some protesters, consumed with perfecting their chants and disrupting the flow of society, can lead them to disregard their personal safety. They may expect others to prioritize their well-being without acknowledging that they themselves hold no significance in the lives of those around them.  The protester's decision to stand in the street with a sign reflects a misguided attempt to make their voice heard. However, this choice was ill-advised, as it placed their life in jeopardy. Standing in the middle of a road, particularly at night, poses a significant risk to anyone, regardless of their race. In this specific case, given the relatively dark section of a high-speed roadway, the individual was inviting danger. While it may be politically incorrect to mention, it is a fact that visibility becomes more challenging in such circumstances. Unfortunately, the consequences of this reckless act were the direct result of reality meeting the individual's demands.  Instances like these, where protesters create chaos and demand attention, are not uncommon. However, this individual should redirect their demands towards those responsible for their misguided belief in a safe zone that does not extend to the real world. Educators, media figures like Don Lemon and news outlets like CNN, as well as public figures like Eric Holder, all contribute to shaping the worldview of these individuals. It is imperative that they understand that the consequences of their actions extend beyond the controlled environments they are accustomed to.  While this incident did not result in a fatality, it is surprising that similar incidents do not occur more frequently. Aggressive individuals who seek to intimidate and assault innocent citizens using their own civility as a weapon should face the consequences of their actions. Natural law does not adhere to political correctness or manipulated social status; it treats stupidity equally across all colors.  Perhaps this incident will serve as a”X.   Homeowner Delivers Festive Surprise to Christmas Burglar: A Shot of Karma  In an unexpected turn of events this Christmas, Nathaniel Blair was confronted with a most unconventional holiday surprise as he stumbled upon a masked intruder ransacking his residence. Returning from a delightful dinner with his family on Christmas Eve, Blair dutifully tucked his three-year-old daughter into bed. Seizing the opportunity to retrieve some yuletide presents from his vehicle parked in the garage, Blair inadvertently left the door to his abode unlocked, enabling the audacious thief to gain entry. Unbeknownst to Blair, this minor oversight set the stage for an exhilarating encounter.  Shortly after reentering his home, Blair's memory was jogged, compelling him to relocate his truck into the garage. In that moment, he made an internal declaration: "You, my friend, have chosen the wrong household if you think you can waltz into my domain and commit such transgressions," he quipped. Astonishingly, law enforcement had already been alerted to a suspicious character clad in a ski mask attempting to infiltrate a neighbor's basement window hours prior. Thus, it was with a sense of urgency that they returned at approximately 3:30 a.m., in search of the very same miscreant whom Blair had bravely incapacitated with a single, well-aimed shotgun blast.  As the dust settles on this eventful Christmas tale, one cannot help but contemplate the outpouring of support for Blair, who is hailed as a defender of justice in his community. This incident serves as a chilling reminder that even amid the season of giving and goodwill, there are those who seek to exploit the vulnerability of others. Nonetheless, Blair's swift and resolute response has provided solace to his neighbors and reaffirmed the notion that, ultimately, justice will prevail.”XÒ  Ann Coulter, the prominent conservative figure, recently appeared on The View to discuss her newly released book, Adios America. In a spirited debate, Coulter demonstrated her unwavering support for Donald Trump, highlighting his independence from big donors. The conversation eventually shifted to the topic of immigration, where Coulter made a compelling argument about the economic impact of bringing in low-skilled immigrants. She pointed out that a significant proportion of immigrant workers are employed in household occupations and laundry/dry cleaning services, despite representing a small fraction of the overall labor force. Coulter's assertion that immigrants often rely on welfare resonated with her conservative perspective.  However, Coulter's remarks did not go unchallenged. Joy Behar, one of the co-hosts, accused Coulter of being an "immigrant basher" for her views. Coulter swiftly countered this accusation, asserting that Democrats seek to attract immigrants for political gain, while wealthy individuals benefit from their cheap labor. The statistics she provided appeared to support her claims, indicating that a substantial number of low-skilled immigrant workers occupy specific sectors of the American job market.  One particularly noteworthy moment occurred when Coulter was asked if she considered herself a Native American. In a clever response, she claimed her status as a descendant of settlers, asserting that without their contribution, there would be no United States. This statement seemed to irk Raven Symone, another host, who attempted to dismiss Coulter's argument. Coulter swiftly fired back, highlighting Symone's previous controversial statement about hiring someone with a certain name. Coulter emphasized that she was discussing government policies that impact both Americans and immigrants, contrasting Symone's focus on trivial matters.  Coulter's fearlessness and devotion to her beliefs were evident throughout the interview. Her book, Adios America, has been praised by her supporters for its candid portrayal of the immigration issue. Coulter boldly addresses the subject, shedding light on truths that others dare not speak. For those seeking an alternative perspective, the book comes highly recommended.”X4
  DHS Disregards Law Requiring Deception Technology, Frustrates Arizona Representative  WASHINGTON - In a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Wednesday, the ongoing ineffectiveness and deliberate obstruction by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in matters related to national security were once again brought to light. Titled "Shutting Down Terrorist Pathways into America," the hearing's very name contradicts the approach taken by the Obama administration to combat the terrorist threat. Rather than prioritizing security, the Obama administration has focused on making entry into the country as easy as possible, regardless of individuals' intentions or backgrounds.   Representative Martha McSalley (R-AZ) expressed her frustration with the lack of action from DHS, the State Department, and the United Nations screeners responsible for approving the entry of unknown individuals with questionable intent and backgrounds into the United States. McSalley has repeatedly urged these agencies to utilize deception detection technology for screening purposes. This technology, which is both effective and affordable, is readily available. However, all she continues to receive from the bureaucrats working under Secretary Jeh Johnson and Secretary John Kerry is a promise to "look into it."   The Congresswoman emphasized that she is not simply asking for DHS to explore the use of deception detection technology; it is actually mandated by law. Furthermore, it was included in 32 recommendations by a bipartisan task force that addressed the shortcomings in our screening process last year. One must question why the current administration, which has expedited the entry of potential terrorists under the guise of accepting refugees, would not support the implementation of mechanisms that could hinder their efforts to undermine America from within. It is much more challenging for them to execute acts of terrorism on our own streets and in our neighborhoods if their jihadists are outside the United States.   During the hearing, McSalley informed the panel that even the most highly trained operatives can only detect deception in about 50 percent of cases when a person is lying to them. This means that approximately half of deceivers successfully pass through security measures, and they are likely to be the most dangerous individuals. McSalley argued, "Off-the-shelf technology exists that can easily and affordably detect deception during interviews conducted overseas and in other locations, as well as in various other scenarios. Since the law was signed last year, directing DHS to explore the use of deception detection technology, what progress has been made?"   Unfortunately, she received inadequate responses indicative of a bureaucracy that is not prioritizing the protection of American citizens. Under the leadership of Jeh Johnson”X	  21 Christians Murdered by ISIS Declared Martyrs in the Coptic Orthodox Church  The recent killing of 21 Egyptian Christians by the Islamic State in Libya has been declared an act of martyrdom by the Coptic Orthodox Church. Pope Tawadros II announced that the names of the victims will be included in the Coptic Synaxarium, the Oriental Church's equivalent to the Roman Martyrology. This recognition is comparable to canonization in the Latin Church.  The martyrdom of these 21 Christians will be commemorated on February 15th in accordance with the Coptic calendar, falling on the feast day of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple. The brutal execution of these individuals was captured in a video released by the Islamic State, titled "A Message Signed in Blood to the Nation of the Cross." The victims, moments before their deaths, were seen mouthing the words "Lord Jesus Christ."  While this tragic event has raised concerns about the proximity of the Islamic State to Europe, it has also served to strengthen the faith of many. In an interview with the Christian channel SAT-7 ARABIC, Beshir Kamel, the brother of two of the martyrs, expressed gratitude to the Islamic State for including their profession of faith in the video. Kamel stated, "ISIS gave us more than we asked when they didn't edit out the part where they declared their faith and called upon Jesus Christ. ISIS helped us strengthen our faith."  Kamel further expressed pride in his brothers' martyrdom, considering it an honor to Christianity. His sentiments were shared by many, as his interview with SAT 7-ARABIC quickly went viral, garnering over 100,000 views within hours of its online posting. Kamel recounted his mother's response when asked how she would react if she encountered an Islamic State militant: "My mother, an uneducated woman in her sixties, said she would ask [him] to enter her house and ask God to open his eyes because he was the reason her son entered the kingdom of heaven."  The recognition of these 21 Christians as martyrs reflects the belief within the Coptic Orthodox Church that martyrdom is a profound act of faith, involving the sacrifice of one's life for refusing to renounce their belief in Jesus Christ. The reward for this martyrdom, according to Christian scripture, is an eternal communion with God. As the apostle Paul wrote, "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined the things that God has prepared for those”XR  Roger Stone, a long-time associate of Donald Trump, recently shared insights into the Trump campaign and its plans to take on Hillary Clinton in the general election. Stone emphasized that Trump is energized and ready to face the challenges ahead, expressing his willingness to accept necessary donations. Stone dismissed concerns about potential influence-purchasing, stating that Trump cannot be bought due to their longstanding relationship. He highlighted Trump's consistent views on trade, immigration, and fiscal policies, stressing that the nominee remains committed to radical reform and stands apart from the current two-party leadership.  Stone also discussed the establishment's fear of Trump's populism, comparing his performance to that of Ronald Reagan. He argued that the establishment's attempts to undermine Trump have only backfired, and criticized Glenn Beck for claiming that Trump is the death of the Republican Party. According to Stone, Trump's populism will actually revive the Party. Stone revealed an ongoing insurrection among House back benchers who want to support Trump, in response to Speaker Paul Ryan's refusal to do so. He viewed this as a positive development and celebrated the absence of the two Bush ex-presidents from the convention, calling them failed presidents.  Regarding the upcoming vice presidential selection, Stone suggested that Trump is considering various options, potentially outside the realm of elected politicians, such as individuals from the military. He emphasized the importance of finding someone who understands government operations and can navigate them effectively.  Stone also warned against donating to the Great America PAC, cautioning that it may be a scam. He dismissed mainstream media claims that Trump is losing ground to Clinton, citing impressive gains in polling. Stone portrayed Trump as fully aware of the resources at his disposal to attack Clinton, promising that she will be caught off guard.  In conclusion, Stone, a constitutional conservative writer, expressed his belief that the nation, Constitution, and traditions are facing multiple threats.”X2  [Watch] Arrests Made as Clash Erupts Between Patriot Protesters and Pro-Amnesty Activists in Murrieta, California  In a clash between two opposing groups in Murrieta, California, tensions ran high as pro-American protesters faced off against pro-amnesty activists. The incident unfolded as part of a larger national debate over immigration policy, with each side passionately advocating for their respective beliefs.  The incident began when a group of vocal liberals, echoing the sentiments of Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and President Obama, engaged in a heated exchange with the pro-American protesters. One individual from the pro-amnesty group crossed the street and allegedly assaulted a pro-American citizen. Law enforcement swiftly intervened, arresting several individuals involved in the altercation.  A member of the pro-American contingent shed light on the situation, stating that a supporter of amnesty had physically attacked a citizen, prompting police intervention. The witness also claimed that at one point, five pro-amnesty activists were involved in a physical altercation with a police officer.  This incident reflects a growing trend of Americans standing up against what they perceive as abuses by those in power. Many feel that the current administration, led by socialist-leaning figures, has overstepped its bounds and is undermining the nation's core values, Constitution, and traditions.  The arrest of these individuals marks a turning point, as more Americans begin to assert their voices and push back against what they perceive as a threat to the nation. This development is seen by many as a long overdue response to the perceived hijacking of the government and the nation by socialist forces.  Rick Wells, a conservative author, recognizes the multitude of threats currently facing the nation. He argues that our Constitution, traditions, and overall way of life are under attack, and welcomes the recent pushback from patriotic Americans.

The assault occurred during the celebration of the band's long-awaited album, "A Moon Shaped Pool," which marked their return to the music scene after a five-year hiatus.   The event started as a peaceful gathering, with fans eagerly anticipating the first new music from Radiohead in half a decade. Attendees sat around, engaged in conversations, and enjoyed beer. However, this seemingly innocent act was met with outrage from some Muslim men who were troubled by the consumption of alcohol during Ramadan, the Islamic holy month when such behavior is strictly forbidden.  Video footage captured the moment when the men stormed into the store, shouting, "Close it down! Close it down!" They proceeded to forcibly remove one of the patrons from the premises. One of the agitated men returned, launching into a tirade of insults and curses directed at the remaining fans. In a display of frustration, he knocked over beer cans and threw a bar stool, plunging the store into darkness. Despite the lack of visibility, the audio recording captured the menacing threats from outside, including, "I'll kill you" and "I will burn you alive inside."  The situation escalated further when some patrons who were seated outside were targeted with beer bottles. A witness described the horrifying scene, saying, "All of a sudden, glass bottles were being thrown at us by some men. They were throwing them at people's heads." Emergency medical personnel were promptly summoned to provide aid to the injured, but no arrests have been reported thus far.  The incident, while distressing, is unlikely to garner attention from the White House, given its limited scale and occurrence outside of the United States. Even if it were to be acknowledged, it is expected that the response would align with the familiar rhetoric of peace associated with the Islamic religion. As with the recurring verses of a modern pop song, the refrain of "It's a religion of peace" continues to echo.”X	  "The Price on Salman Rushdie's Head Soars Higher, Fueling Political Infighting in Iran  NEW YORK - On February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the uncompromising leader of Iran, issued a fatwa, a religious decree, calling for the assassination of acclaimed author Salman Rushdie due to alleged blasphemy in his novel, The Satanic Verses. With each passing year, state-run media outlets in Iran gather to discuss and occasionally raise the reward for carrying out Khomeini's mission. Last week, these agencies added a staggering $600,000 to the bounty, now totaling approximately $4 million.  Initially, the 15 Khordad Foundation, a religious organization, offered $2.7 million to anyone who would execute the fatwa. In 2012, the reward was increased to $3.3 million. The recent infusion of funds, bringing the total to nearly $4 million, stemmed from 40 news outlets listed by Fars, one of Iran's state-run media organizations, which contributed $30,000. However, it remains unclear whether this bounty will ever be paid out. Most of the participating news agencies are government-owned and subsidized, meaning the funds they possess are essentially the Iranian government's.  Conflicting reports have emerged regarding the status of the fatwa itself, with some suggesting it was rescinded or concluded in 1998. Nevertheless, the current Ayatollah reaffirms its relevance, and the increased bounty may attract more individuals intent on taking Rushdie's life. Multiple reports indicate that political infighting has erupted within Iran, and the escalation of the bounty on Rushdie's head may serve as a mere smokescreen. Observers speculate that this move aims to divert attention from the upcoming elections, as hardliners and their media cohorts seek to discourage high voter turnout.  Mojgan Faraji, a reformist journalist, asserts that hardliners exploit past issues to confuse the public and overshadow critical matters such as voting. She suggests that the recent surge in the bounty serves this purpose. Regardless of the underlying motivation, Rushdie must fortify his security measures with additional deadbolts. As the situation unfolds, only time will reveal the true intentions behind this alarming development.  (Quotes sourced from The New York Times. Additional information obtained from The Huffington Post.)"”X)	  Liberal Confusion: UN Criticizes US States' Marijuana Legalization  In a recent development, the United Nations (UN) has expressed its disapproval of the push to legalize marijuana at the state level in the United States, citing violations of international drug conventions. This announcement has left liberals in a state of confusion, as they often turn to the UN when the US veers in a direction they don't support. Yury Fedotov, executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), plans to discuss this matter with the US State Department next week. The UN seems to believe that the decisions made by individual American states regarding their own laws hold no significance. "I don't see how (the new laws) can be compatible with existing conventions," Fedotov told reporters.  However, one might question the existence of conventions on cannabis usage at the international level. After all, other countries are also legalizing marijuana, so why is the UN targeting the US? In 2013, Uruguay became the first country to legalize and regulate the production and sale of marijuana, a move that the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) deemed as contravening the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The INCB argues that this convention requires states to restrict cannabis use to medical and scientific purposes due to its potential for dependence. The INCB, based in Vienna, oversees compliance with this and two other drug control treaties.  This conflict between international drug conventions and the actions of individual states raises questions about the awareness and understanding of treaties, conventions, and agreements by lawmakers, including those within the Obama Administration. It appears that the idea of states' rights holds little importance for the UN and most countries. This clash of laws is likely to cause more complications in the future.  It is important to note that the source of this article is Reuters. Some critics argue that UN treaties themselves are violations of human rights. Regardless, this topic provides an interesting perspective for liberals and conservatives alike, although it seems to be written from a conservative viewpoint. The author, a self-proclaimed conservative, highlights the failures of drug prohibition and advocates for a more enlightened approach to drug policy.”X©  Hillary Clinton has agreed to testify before the Special Committee on Benghazi, according to her lawyer, David Kendall.

  Democrats Celebrate Flawed Candidate, Sheriff Clarke Remarks  MILWAUKEE â€” Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, a prominent supporter of Donald J. Trump, expressed his disappointment with the Democratic National Convention in a recent interview. Specifically, Sheriff Clarke found Corey Booker's convention speech lacking in substance and questioned the underlying anger in Booker's delivery.  "What's he so angry about?" Sheriff Clarke asked jokingly. "I mean, when Donald Trump uses that kind of passion, they say he's angry. But the only thing he didn't use was a promise of a car in every driveway and a chicken in every pot."  Sheriff Clarke further criticized the Democrats for ignoring what he sees as their biggest problem this election season: their flawed candidate, Hillary Clinton. He argued that Clinton should have faced criminal charges and accused her of being a confirmed liar who left people to die in Benghazi.  "That stuff matters to the American people," Sheriff Clarke emphasized. "This thing will go on, just like the Republican National Convention. They'll get their pom-poms out, rah-rah and whatnot. But there's a stark contrast, I think, with the Republicans. Donald Trump is the law and order candidate, and this DNC seems to be about embracing criminality and criminal behavior, trying to mainstream it. They hold these individuals up as if they're martyrs and symbols of the new civil rights movement."  During the interview, Megyn Kelly of Fox News brought up the next day's scheduled appearance by the mother of Michael Brown, a young man whose death at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked protests and national debates on police brutality. Kelly pointed out that Brown was the aggressor in the confrontation.  Sheriff Clarke agreed with Kelly's assessment, saying, "If you look at a common denominator among most of those there, they were resisting arrest." He went on to cite four instances where the deceased individuals had resisted arrest, with two cases involving aggression and potentially lethal force against the officers before the perpetrators were shot and killed.  While acknowledging that mothers will defend their sons no matter what, Sheriff Clarke raised a question that he believes has not been satisfactorily answered: "Where are the dads?" He argued that the absence of fathers in shaping the behavior of young boys leads to their becoming unmanageable misfits that the police then have to deal with aggressively.  Sheriff Clarke's remarks highlight the contrasting views and themes present in the ongoing presidential campaign.

El-Jayyousi, a psychology and women's studies major, expressed her concerns in a strongly worded letter to the campus newspaper, The Missourian, stating that she does not feel safe on campus due to the film's screening.  El-Jayyousi believes that the film not only perpetuates harmful stereotypes but also creates a hostile environment for Arab, Muslim, South Asian, and people of color on campus. While some may view her concerns as unfounded, it is important to respect her right to voice her opinion and express her feelings of insecurity.  The controversy surrounding "American Sniper" stems from differing interpretations of the film's protagonist, Chris Kyle, a former Navy SEAL sniper. While many Americans view Kyle as a hero and protector, El-Jayyousi and others argue that he was a killer who showed no regard for human life. These conflicting perspectives highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding the United States' involvement in various conflicts.  El-Jayyousi is not calling for censorship of the film, but rather for a recognition of her right to feel safe on campus. She is asking for the film not to be shown and for an official apology and explanation from those involved in approving its screening. This request has sparked further debate among students and faculty about the balance between freedom of speech and the responsibility to create a respectful and inclusive environment.  Critics argue that El-Jayyousi's demands are excessive and question her credibility, particularly as she attends a university known for its spirited football culture, where obscenities against rivals are not uncommon. However, it is crucial to remember that universities are places where diverse opinions and perspectives should be respected and discussed.  The controversy surrounding "American Sniper" at the University of Missouri Columbia highlights the ongoing tensions between different cultural and political viewpoints. It serves as a reminder of the importance of open dialogue and understanding in a diverse and inclusive academic environment.”X  Sex Offenders Will No Longer Be Required to Register in New York State  Residents of New York State are facing a loss of peace of mind as a state law that mandated Level 1 sex offenders to register their location for 20 years expired on January 1. The law, implemented in 1996, covered offenses such as rape in the first degree, sodomy, and child molestation. With the expiration of this law, the number of registered sex offenders in the state is expected to decrease significantly, leading to concerns among citizens.  Laura Ahearn, a member of the Long Island advocacy group Parents For Megans Law, expressed her discontent with the situation. She revealed that approximately 60 to 70 Level 1 sex offenders will be removed from the registry in Nassau and Suffolk this year alone. Ahearn emphasized that these individuals have committed serious offenses against young children, some as young as two years old. She questioned the leadership's response to the issue and vowed to continue her efforts to address the problem.  In an attempt to rectify the situation, Long Island Republican Dean Murray introduced a bill in the Assembly that would extend the registration requirement from 20 to 30 years. However, for the bill to pass, Murray still needs a Democratic sponsor in the Democrat-controlled chamber. The state's official registry is currently accessible online and allows the public to search for information by last name, county, or zip code. Level 2 and 3 sex offenders, on the other hand, are required to register for life.  Last year, New York State lawmakers eliminated the authority of local governments to impose residency restrictions on sex offenders. A law that prohibited sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school was overturned by the state Court of Appeals. Prior to this decision, 109 cities, towns, and villages, along with 21 counties, had enacted such restrictions. Critics argue that the state's focus on rehabilitation statistics may be overshadowing the need for more realistic measures to protect communities.

In case you missed it, allow me to summarize the proceedings. The majority of the time was spent witnessing a spirited exchange between the socialistic figure resembling a Gremlin, Bernie Sanders, and the polarizing figure known for her role in the Benghazi incident, Hillary Clinton. Their battle centered around who could promise more freebies to the American public. However, amidst this lackluster affair, one individual managed to captivate the audience's attention: Donald Trump.  While the debate unfolded, Trump took to Twitter, sharing his unfiltered thoughts on the Democratic candidates. These tweets proved to be more engaging than the entire debate itself. In light of this, I present to you a compilation of the top ten most memorable Trump tweets from the evening.

Blaine, who is regarded as one of the most gifted students in her grade â€“ as her proud mother often attests â€“ did not hesitate to express her confusion and frustration with the controversial educational standards.  "This is crazy!" Blaine exclaimed, her words resonating with the room. "I have not even the slightest clue what this means." With an unwavering determination, she continued, "Nonsense is putting it mildly." Blaine's eloquent critique of the Common Core left the audience in awe.  The Common Core curriculum, implemented in numerous states across the country, has faced significant backlash since its introduction. Blaine highlighted its potential negative consequences, arguing that it grants excessive federal control over curriculum, encroaches upon local and parental authority, and fails to demonstrate any evidence of improved learning or educational outcomes.  Blaine's impassioned remarks shed light on the growing concern among parents, educators, and students regarding the impact of Common Core. As the debate continues to unfold, her bold stance serves as a reminder that even the youngest among us have the power to ignite change and challenge the status quo.”X  "Obama's Competence Questioned Amidst Lack of Confidence, Even Among Liberals  Attention Barack Obama and Company: Ron Fournier has departed the political arena. With a mounting series of scandals during the Obama administration, the American public's trust in the government's ability to address any given issue has steadily dwindled. While this lack of faith may not necessarily spell doom in the long run, it is crucial to maintain some level of confidence in the government's capacity to lead during times of crisis. Presently, the Obama Administration fails to inspire enough confidence to confront even Canada, let alone effectively contain and prevent the spread of Ebola. It is worth noting that someone managed to enter the country carrying the disease after Obama declared such an occurrence impossible. And resorting to incompetence as a defense? That is hardly a characteristic of genuine leadership. We commend Ron Fournier for his candidness as a liberal. He exemplifies the courage to voice thoughts that resonate with the rest of us."”X)  ISIS Fighters in Iraq Suspected of Contracting Ebola  Reports from Iraqi media outlets suggest that ISIS militants have recently sought treatment at a hospital in Mosul after displaying symptoms similar to those associated with the Ebola virus. However, the ability of local experts and doctors to effectively test for the virus remains uncertain. A Kurdish official, who strongly believes that these cases indeed involve Ebola, shared this information with the Kurdish media outlet Xendan. It must be noted that accurate diagnosis of Ebola in this region can be challenging due to shared symptoms with other diseases like malaria and yellow fever.   It is important to exercise caution when interpreting these reports, as further verification is required to confirm the presence of Ebola among ISIS fighters.”Xm  BeyoncÃ©'s VMA Performance: A Deeper Analysis  In his insightful analysis, Mark Dice, an expert on all things Illuminati, sheds light on BeyoncÃ© Knowles' VMA performance, revealing a more sinister meaning behind it. While many may dismiss it as a mere spectacle, Dice argues that it is a disturbing manifestation of anti-social sentiments, America-hatred, and manipulation of impressionable fans.  Dice points out that Knowles, accompanied by mothers of deceased criminals, including Michael Brown, who had attempted to harm a police officer after her son's robbery, used her appearance to symbolically denounce law enforcement and promote the black crime movement. This provocative choice aligns with her image as a spoiled and deceitful figure, preying on the naivety of her followers.  The performance takes an unexpected turn, as Dice observes Knowles' transition from an initially pleasant demeanor to a darker side. Her dancers are symbolically shot and killed by racist police officers, leading her to embrace a Satan character on stage. Dice describes the subsequent transformation as a fiery and fierce Illuminati ritual, with flashing red and blue lights representing her targeted audience: the police.  Knowles further mimics the thuggish behavior of her Black Lives Matter allies, funded by George Soros, by brandishing a baseball bat and attacking the camera focused on her. One of the songs she performs, "Formation," is labeled as an anti-cop, New Black Panther, black power agitation offering. This piece also served as the centerpiece of her Super Bowl performance, where she launched a similar attack on law enforcement.  The admiration Knowles receives from individuals like Michelle Obama, who sees her as a role model for their daughters, may be attributed to her controversial actions. Her copulation mimicking, a staple of her performances, and her apparent connection to the Illuminati further deepen the intrigue surrounding her.  Dice concludes by criticizing MTV for straying from its original purpose of promoting music. He argues that their choices and actions reflect an agenda that is far removed from the industry's essence.”X	  (BREAKING VIDEO) Russian Journalists Targeted on Turkey-Syria Border By [Author Name]  In a chilling and exclusive video, captured in real-time, the horrifying moment when two Russian reporters from RT were bombed on the Syria-Turkey border is revealed. This shocking incident occurred simultaneously with the Turkish attack on a Russian warplane, further escalating tensions between the two nations. While the Kremlin remains cautious and asserts that it is premature to jump to conclusions, this incident raises serious concerns about the intensifying conflict in the region.   The video footage, obtained firsthand, offers a distressing glimpse into the dangers faced by journalists reporting from the frontlines. In a matter of seconds, chaos and destruction unfold before our eyes as the targeted reporters become victims of an unexpected and devastating attack. The sheer brutality of this act underscores the precarious conditions faced by media personnel operating in conflict zones.  This incident occurred amidst the already strained relations between Russia and Turkey, which have been further exacerbated by the downing of a Russian warplane. The ramifications of these events are expected to reverberate through the geopolitical landscape, potentially affecting global alliances and strategies in the fight against terrorism in the region.  As authorities and world leaders scramble to make sense of this latest incident, the Kremlin urges restraint and emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation before any conclusions can be drawn. While the immediate focus remains on the safety and well-being of the affected journalists, questions surrounding the motives and perpetrators behind this attack are certain to arise.  This alarming development serves as a stark reminder of the risks faced by journalists who risk their lives to bring the truth to light. The attack on these reporters highlights the importance of protecting press freedoms and ensuring the safety of those who seek to expose the realities of conflict.  The international community now awaits further updates and official statements regarding this distressing incident. As tensions escalate and uncertainty looms, the ramifications of this attack on the already fragile relationship between Russia and Turkey are yet to be fully understood.”X*  Ted Nugent Criticizes Obama's Response to Gun Control in the Wake of Umpqua Shooting  In the aftermath of the Umpqua Community College shooting, President Obama wasted no time in using the tragedy to advocate for stricter gun control measures. While his speech was undoubtedly filled with passion, it is worth noting that his emotions were not solely directed towards the victims. Rather, it seems that Obama's frustration stems from his inability to fully transform the issue of gun control.  Ted Nugent, a prominent gun rights advocate, took to Facebook to call out Obama's deception. In a powerful post, Nugent criticized the President for his failure to address important factors that are being ignored. Nugent also quoted an open letter to Obama written by Alan Korwin, also known as The Uninvited Ombudsman. Korwin pointed out that Obama's impassioned speech failed to mention the tragic deaths of 16 black Americans who were shot and murdered in ghettos on the same day, and countless others who suffer the same fate daily. This lack of coverage, according to Korwin, obscures the real issue and politicizes it, as the President himself admitted.  Another crucial aspect that Obama seems to overlook is the fact that existing background checks have prevented two million known criminals and mentally unfit individuals from purchasing guns. However, these individuals are simply released back into society. Nugent further expressed his concerns on Twitter, stating that self-defense is prohibited in gun-free zones, which he deems as suicidal insanity.  Amidst this ongoing debate, Obama is scheduled to visit Oregon this week, further exploiting the shooting incident. Interestingly, some of the victims' families and even some of the victims themselves have come forward to express their desire for less gun control. They believe that they should have the right to protect themselves with firearms wherever they go. However, it remains doubtful whether Obama will take their requests into consideration, given his track record of not prioritizing the desires of the American people.”•ú     X  Watch the Little Known Story of the 9/11 Boatlift  Fourteen years have passed since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, a day that forever shattered our sense of safety and security. Amidst the horror that unfolded that morning, New York City witnessed the emergence of countless heroes. These unsung individuals, owners and captains of ferries, tugs, and party boats, which regularly traversed the waters around Manhattan, stepped up without hesitation.   Following the attack, concerns over security prompted the immediate suspension of all transportation to and from the island of Manhattan. Consequently, millions of people found themselves stranded, their paths home abruptly severed. While we are familiar with the images of the masses walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, not everyone is aware of the astonishing fact that half a million individuals were evacuated via the waterways surrounding Manhattan.  Prompted by a call from the Coast Guard, these boats set sail for Manhattan, braving uncertainty and danger to rescue those in need. Their courageous efforts, often overshadowed by the larger narrative, embody the resilience and compassion that characterized New York City in the face of unprecedented tragedy.   This is a tale that deserves to be remembered and retold.”XO  Bikers for Trump: Defenders of Order  Byline: [Author Name]  In an interview with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers for Trump, discussed his organization's efforts to safeguard law-abiding citizens during the upcoming Republican convention. Cox shared the group's journey since its inception last August, emphasizing the three key priorities of the majority of American bikers. They seek to identify and effectively combat the threat of radical Islam, viewing President Obama as an ally to ISIS, albeit making an unfair comparison to George Washington. Nevertheless, Cox's message is clear. Additionally, Cox highlights the importance of securing the borders through the construction of a wall and vetting Syrian refugees. He echoes the sentiment of many patriots who believe that America needs a change in leadership, starting from the top.   Cox addresses the chaos that has ensued under the Obama administration, including property destruction and calls for violence against police officers. He stresses the need to support veterans and law enforcement personnel who have been at the forefront of maintaining order. Cox anticipates around 1,000 bikers to descend upon Cleveland for the convention, but there are murmurs that this number could increase tenfold. With the recent Rolling Thunder Memorial Day event attracting 600,000 attendees, surpassing these numbers seems quite feasible.   Promising a strong presence, Cox pledges that his group will counter the disruptive activities of organizations such as Black Lives Matter and other anti-American groups funded by George Soros. They are prepared to stand as a "Wall of Meat" between the police and these agitators, if necessary. Notably, many members of Bikers for Trump are US veterans, a group that the troublemakers of Black Lives Matter and others who target defenseless citizens, including women, should consider before attempting to portray themselves as tough individuals once again.  Note: This rewrite maintains the essence of the original article but presents it in a more formal and objective tone, characteristic of The New York Times.”X„
  Title: Race and Violence: A Divisive Narrative or a Call for Change?  In the aftermath of recent riots, it is important to examine the role race played in these events. While some claim that race served as a false pretense for opportunistic thugs, a deeper analysis reveals a more complex reality. The New York Times investigates the factors at play and the implications they hold for society.  Amidst the chaos, there is a critical rule that white motorists should be aware of when surrounded by any exhibition of aggression and hooliganism. Their survival depends on hitting the accelerator and avoiding becoming victims. Mobs, acting out in a racist and hateful manner, demand an individualistic approach to safety, as the police presence is often limited and unresponsive. The gas pedal becomes a lifeline, akin to a 911 call or a self-defense mechanism.  In the face of mounting tensions and the perception of an emerging race war, some question the calls for disarmament and the trust placed in law enforcement. Skeptics argue that these measures, advocated by President Obama, the Department of Justice, and activists like Al Sharpton, are insufficient when faced with the reality of violent mobs. They criticize leaders who instructed the police to back off, allowing harm to innocent people in order to minimize negative publicity.  But what is the relevance of the chant "black power" or the pretext it provides for unleashing aggression when a black career criminal is shot while threatening a black police officer? The thug, aware of the potential consequences, received what he knew was likely. The invocation of "black power" seems more like an excuse to engage in violence, reminiscent of the Obama-orchestrated Ferguson event. Critics argue that these riots fulfill the desires of those who love violence and seek to exploit the situation for personal gain. Blaming the police and labeling it as a racial issue becomes a rallying cry to protect themselves and intimidate police leadership into inaction.  However, it is important to acknowledge that racism exists not only among white individuals but among black individuals as well. While some may argue that black racism is a response to historical and ongoing oppression, the reality is that there is no leveling of the playing field when a mob destroys property or assaults people solely because they have white skin. Such criminal acts cannot be justified under the guise of power, but rather should be recognized as black crime.  The recent videos showcasing violence and the use of "hood English" by some individuals serve as a stark reminder of the issues that persist in our education system. While one individual may”XÉ   9-Year-Old Martial Artist Discovers the Strength in Tears  In a society where little boys are often taught to suppress their emotions, one martial arts instructor in Detroit is challenging the status quo. Jason Wilson, the founder of the faith-based group Cave of Adullam, is teaching young men that crying is not a sign of weakness, but rather a display of strength. Through his practice called Masar Ru, which combines various martial arts and meditations, Wilson aims to help boys gain control over their emotions.  A recent session with 9-year-old Bruce showcased the transformative power of this approach. As Bruce attempted to break a board with his hand, he found himself overwhelmed and brought to tears. Rather than dismissing his emotions, the organization made the bold decision to share the video, aiming to demonstrate that it is not only normal for young men to cry during difficult times, but also important to support them through it.  Wilson and his team patiently guide these young martial artists through their emotional journeys, helping them develop resilience and emotional intelligence. By challenging societal norms and encouraging vulnerability, Wilson hopes to redefine masculinity and empower young boys to embrace their emotions.  The video of Bruce's emotional breakthrough has garnered significant attention, resonating with viewers who have long questioned the expectations placed on boys to suppress their feelings. Wilson's unconventional approach has sparked a larger conversation about the importance of emotional well-being in young men.  As society continues to grapple with harmful stereotypes surrounding masculinity, Wilson's work stands as a beacon of hope, offering a new perspective on what it means to be a strong and emotionally intelligent young man. Through the practice of Masar Ru, Wilson is not only teaching martial arts, but also instilling valuable life skills that will shape the next generation of compassionate and resilient individuals.”Xf
  Title: Clinton Campaign Manager Dismisses Patriots as Deplorable, New Ad Targets Clinton's Unfitness for Office  In a recent interview, Clinton Campaign Manager Robbie Mook faced criticism for his alleged cover-ups and untruths surrounding the Democratic nominee's controversial past. Mook's role, according to critics, is to present a false image of Hillary Clinton, concealing her alleged abuses of power and dishonesty. However, Mook's attempts to depict Clinton as a champion for the American people have been met with skepticism, as her true intentions, they claim, are to exploit her position for personal gain.  One of the most troubling aspects of Clinton's campaign, according to her detractors, is her disdain for patriotic Americans who hold their nation and Constitution in high regard. By aligning herself with lawbreakers, predators, and undocumented immigrants, she has drawn ire from those who view her as parasitically feeding off the nation, much like those she associates with. Moreover, the hardworking citizens who have built this country are viewed as her enemies, as she continues to dismantle the very foundations that they have painstakingly established.  For many Americans, Clinton's deplorable label serves as an endorsement of character rather than an insult. They argue that it would be offensive if she believed she had anything in common with true Americans, given her alleged corruption and anti-American sentiments. This sentiment is shared by a significant portion of the population, who view her as unfit for any position of power, let alone the presidency.  In response to the mounting criticism, the Trump campaign has released a new ad highlighting various reasons why Clinton is deemed unfit for office. One particular point of contention surrounds her mishandling of classified emails, a topic that has haunted her throughout her campaign. Mook, however, attempted to downplay the gravity of the situation by stating that the FBI found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Critics argue that Mook's claim is a demonstrable lie, as FBI Director James Comey affirmed the opposite during a recent congressional hearing. While Comey chose not to prosecute Clinton for political reasons, his responses to specific questions raised doubts about her innocence.

The town of Turlock is located approximately 100 miles east of San Francisco.  The accused, Frank Guerra, pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of battery and kidnapping. He has been prohibited from contacting the victim and was denied bail. The abuse allegedly took place between August 1, 2015 and January 4, 2016. The woman managed to escape one day and subsequently reported the incident to the authorities. Surprisingly, she waited until February to contact the police, although her reasons for the delay remain unknown. The victim has chosen to remain anonymous.  According to The Modesto Bee, Guerra would lock the woman inside a dog crate measuring 30 inches by 48 inches while he went to work each day. Disturbingly, she was forced to relieve herself in the cage, and she has accused Guerra of repeatedly smearing dog feces on her. Deputy District Attorney Beth DeJong revealed in court that Guerra had bitten the victim on the back, leading to permanent scarring. Furthermore, he would sometimes push her to the ground and kick her until she entered the cage.  In a troubling escalation, Guerra allegedly sent the victim photos of himself holding a gun after she managed to escape. He also threatened to post nude pictures of her on social media. DeJong played a voice message left by Guerra in court, in which he acknowledged the horrible treatment he subjected the victim to. "I know what I [expletive] did to you," he said, as quoted by DeJong. "Putting you in a cage, [expletive] biting you... Not [expletive] trusting you."  The extent of the trauma endured by the victim is unimaginable. Guerra will now be confined, although his cage will measure 6 feet by 8 feet and will include a cot and a daily meal. This stark contrast highlights the disparity between the perpetrator and the victim, with Guerra receiving undeserved privileges despite the heinous nature of his alleged crimes.”X¦
  Ted Cruzâ€™s Political Career Takes a Fatal Blow with Just Three Words  Ted Cruz, the Texas senator with an all-or-nothing mindset, has never been one to tread the middle ground. His staunchly conservative views have attracted a following of like-minded individuals who share his rigid approach to politics. But for many Americans, there has always been something off about Cruz. It's not just his smarmy demeanor; it's his blatant self-interest that he consistently puts before anything else.  At the 2016 Republican National Convention, Cruz was given a prime-time speaking slot, and both supporters and critics eagerly anticipated his remarks. It was widely speculated that this speech would serve as the launch of Cruz's campaign for the 2020 presidential election. He delved into policy and emphasized hard-line conservative issues, all the while conspicuously avoiding endorsing the party's nominee, Donald Trump. Instead, Cruz urged listeners to vote their conscience.  This omission proved to be a grave mistake, as boos and interruptions erupted from the convention floor. Chants of "We want Trump!" drowned out Cruz's pleas for unity. In the aftermath, it was clear that Cruz had left the stage having further divided an already fractured party. The perspective from those in the thick of it was damning. A Cruz supporter told Breitbart News that the senator's actions were entirely selfish and had irreparably damaged his future prospects. Others described his address as a slap in the face and accused him of toying with the convention.  Reactions behind the scenes were even more scathing. Dana Bash of CNN reported that Cruz was confronted in a donor suite and called a disgrace to his face. One Trump supporter became so enraged that he had to be physically restrained, while Heidi Cruz faced heckling from delegates and had to be escorted from the convention floor. These incidents reflect the prevailing sentiment among convention attendees towards Ted Cruz.  Many ordinary Americans had an instinctual distrust of Cruz long before this convention. Some Cruz supporters began to question their loyalty during the primary season, while others were awakened to the senator's true nature on Wednesday evening. Cruz had a genuine opportunity to rise to greatness, but his refusal to gracefully concede in the face of an undeniable defeat has exposed a lack of class in the American sense.  Undoubtedly, some of the animosity towards Cruz stems from revelations made during the primary months. Journalists unearthed information about Cruz that Trump eagerly seized upon, and Cruz never fully refuted these claims. Allegations of mistresses and his father's supposed CIA connections were just the tip of the iceberg”Xq
  OPINION: Colorado Controversy Exposes Deeper Distrust in Republican Party  In a wake-up call for the American people, the recent events in Colorado have shed light on a troubling reality: the Republican Party's disregard for the popular vote. This has become a rallying cry for those who question the trustworthiness of the party in power. It raises the question - if the party has the final say in nominating their candidate, why bother with letting the people vote at all?  The term "oligarchy" has gained popularity in recent days, as it accurately describes the small group of individuals who wield immense control over our country, organizations, and institutions. These power players, backed by the combined forces of the Democratic and Republican Parties, as well as their wealthy funders, have effectively taken charge of our federal government. This is not unique to the United States - many countries operate in a similar fashion. However, it is particularly concerning in a nation that prides itself on being a republic, where the interests of the people should be prioritized.  In reality, the United States operates on a foundation of money, with the interests of those at the top of the economic ladder taking precedence. Lobbyists are employed to sway elected lawmakers, who are meant to represent the people's interests, to instead serve the needs of the wealthy. This influence extends beyond politics, as mainstream media and even alternative news sites are also manipulated to promote specific narratives. The conflicts of interest within conservative circles are particularly glaring.  This system is further reinforced by the lack of trade barriers that allow goods and services to flow freely into the country, while other nations face obstacles when attempting to access the lucrative American market. As a result, the elite few who control the government can continue to profit at the expense of the rest of us.  The term "oligarchy" has been frequently used in the blogosphere in recent days, as trust in mainstream media sources wanes. Some commenters have labeled the United States as a "corporate oligarchy," emphasizing the dominance of big business. Others have described it as a "nihilist" state, with the rejection of moral principles and the belief that life is meaningless. In the case of the American oligarchy, religion holds little influence unless it is politically exploited, which is an inappropriate use of faith. Moral principles have been effectively nullified.  To be precise, the oligarchy may simply be driven by globalist motives. Both corporatism and nihilism apply to this construct. Ultimately, the political parties in the”XC	  YouTube Censors Sharyl Attkisson's Full Measure Channel  In a recent development, YouTube has come under scrutiny for censoring content on Sharyl Attkisson's Full Measure channel. Attkisson, a former CBS news correspondent who now runs her own online news outlet, was notified that the videos uploaded to the YouTube channel associated with her website violate the platform's community standards.  It is important to note that social media platforms, including YouTube, are largely privately owned or publicly traded companies with boards of directors. As such, the owners have the authority to establish community standards as they see fit. YouTube, for instance, was acquired by Google in 2006, making all content posted on the platform subject to the community standards imposed by Google.  According to Attkisson, the videos posted on her Full Measure website were simply news stories produced by her team. Interested readers can visit the website and judge for themselves whether the content violates community standards or if Google is attempting to control the content available for public consumption.  The announcement of YouTube's decision has sparked significant backlash on social media, with many expressing their concerns. Details regarding which specific video was deemed to violate the rules have not been made clear. Attkisson gained prominence by deeply investigating scandals during the Obama Administration, such as Benghazi and Fast and Furious, which the mainstream media largely ignored. Her Full Measure website appears to continue this effort with the same level of integrity, as any member of a free press should.  Although some may disagree with Attkisson's perspectives or her style of reporting, it is crucial to recognize and defend her right to express herself on an open and free internet. YouTube, like other online platforms, operates under the discretion of Google, which not only controls numerous platforms but also determines search engine criteria through its algorithms. As users, we are left with little choice but to adapt to these conditions.  It is worth noting that Google is now owned by its holding company, Alphabet, Inc. For further information on the controlling interests of this conglomerate, please refer to the Wikipedia page.

In Toronto, our neighbors to the north, public elementary school students are required to receive instruction in music. However, adhering to the rules of Islam, one man refuses to subject his children to singing and instrument playing. This individual, known as Dasu, has organized over 130 parents in the past two years to protest the music requirement in Toronto's primary school system.  Utilizing the religious clauses of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian version of Freedom of Religion, Dasu and his group have requested religious exemptions. Initial conversations with the group indicate that the school board attempted to find accommodations, but Dasu and his followers were adamant about complete non-participation in music.  Meanwhile, Western Christians, Jews, agnostics, and even atheists are grappling with ways to salvage what remains of music education. As a classical musician who has been a member of civic choruses and church choirs for over 27 years, I find this clash to be deeply distressing.”XO   Emails obtained by the House Government Oversight and Reform Committee reveal that Jonathan Gruber, the MIT professor infamous for his comments about the "stupidity of the American people," played a more significant role in the creation of ObamaCare than previously thought. Despite claims that Gruber was just a low-level contractor with no ties to the Obama Administration, these emails show that he was intimately involved in the development of the healthcare law. According to Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Gruber's proximity to the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services was much closer than officials have admitted. The Wall Street Journal reports that Gruber acted as an advisor to key players in the Obama Administration and even played a role in swaying Sen. Mary Landrieu to vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act. The emails also reveal that Gruber advised President Obama to hold out for more money for universal coverage and sought advice from White House officials on dealing with reporters. Gruber advocated for the shake down of pharmaceutical companies to finance the passage efforts and predicted that millions of young, healthy individuals would be caught in the ObamaCare system to help fund the operation. However, neither of these predictions have come true. The White House and Obama Administration are downplaying the significance of the report and the emails, dismissing them as old news. Nevertheless, this new information contradicts the previous narrative that Gruber was a minor player in the creation and implementation of ObamaCare. The emails show that he was considered an integral part of the process and was even referred to as a hero by Jeanne Lambrew, a White House official. It is clear that Gruber's involvement in ObamaCare was far more significant than initially portrayed.”X!   "US College Dean Encourages Starting ISIS Training Camps for Students: A Disturbing Revelation"  In a shocking turn of events, Joseph Scaffido, a dean at Cornell University, has been captured on hidden camera endorsing the establishment of ISIS training camps on American campuses. This alarming revelation has stirred outrage among rational individuals who find it inconceivable that someone in such a position of authority would casually advocate for such dangerous activities.   The incident unfolded as part of a social prank show called Project Veridas, where one of its journalists assumed the identity of a student named Ali, seeking to exploit the prestigious Ivy League institution for the purpose of supplying resources to the Islamic State and training future ISIS militants. Astonishingly, the liberal-leaning dean welcomed all program proposals, even as Ali hinted at his connection with ISIS.   This incident raises serious concerns about the prevailing liberal mindset that seemingly prioritizes individuality over national security. While it is understandable to decry acts of police violence, the tolerance displayed towards training individuals who may pose a significant threat to innocent lives is deeply troubling.   As the nation grapples with the implications of this revelation, it is crucial to ponder the implications of such liberal leniency. How far will this acceptance of potentially dangerous ideologies extend? The question remains: when will this liberal madness reach its limits?   The gravity of this situation demands a thorough examination of the values and principles that shape our educational institutions. It is an opportunity for society to reflect on the delicate balance between individual freedom and the collective well-being of the nation. What are your thoughts on this matter?”XÚ
  University of California: Zero Tolerance for Intolerance  The rising cost of college education in the United States, which is believed to be contributing to a generation of uninformed individuals, has become a pressing concern for the Board of Regents at the University of California. Topmost on their agenda is the issue of intolerance. The University of California is unwavering in its commitment to upholding its core values of respect, inclusivity, and academic freedom. The principles of free expression and open exchange of ideas, which are enshrined in our national and state Constitutions, are deeply ingrained in the university's fabric. Tolerance, too, is an integral part of the University of California, and it is imperative that students, faculty, and staff respect the dignity of every person within the UC community. Intolerance has no place at this esteemed institution. We define intolerance as any unwelcome conduct driven by discrimination or hatred towards individuals or groups. This may manifest in forms such as violence, intimidation, threats, harassment, hate speech, derogatory language that perpetuates stereotypes or prejudices, or the inflammatory and derogatory use of symbols associated with hate, prejudice, or discrimination.  One might ponder how the Cal regents would handle a dispute between a Baptist and a Catholic concerning the use of the Septuagint Old Testament versus the Massorah. However, it seems they are not well-versed in biblical matters. Therefore, let us move on. It is rather ironic that those who themselves display intolerance towards anything that deviates from their own worldview are now instructing faculty and students to be intolerant of intolerance. Every perspective is meant to be welcomed and respected. No debates that might cause discomfort or challenge one's convictions. The university's role as a space for exploring diverse ideas and fostering open conversations seems to have been undermined. It also appears that the First Amendment rights of students and faculty are being compromised. The Board of Regents at Cal is demonstrating their tolerance for regulating speech, which is, in itself, a form of intolerance. However, this new set of principles extends beyond that. Eugene Volokh offers his insights on this matter in The Washington Post.  Volokh highlights that the policy explicitly condemns the expression of certain viewpoints as intolerant and deems them unfit for the University of California. It also deems them a violation of others' rights to be free from intolerant expressions. For example, articulating the belief that individuals with intellectual disabilities are incapable of certain intellectual tasks, or that individuals with physical disabilities are incapable of certain physical”Xa	  ObamaCare Bailouts Imminent, President Assures Treasury Assistance  Late on Friday, February 12, just before the untimely demise of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a significant announcement was hidden deep within a series of federal agency releases. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) disclosed that a staggering $7.7 billion is set to be made available for health insurers to compensate for losses incurred under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare. This revelation has raised concerns about the financial stability of the private health insurance industry and has prompted the Obama Administration to take action to prevent insurers from abandoning the program.  It is widely acknowledged that health insurers are experiencing significant financial burdens as a result of ObamaCare. In an effort to retain as many insurers as possible, the administration has resorted to writing an IOU to the Treasury. However, this solution is not without controversy. Republicans, during budget negotiations in 2013, succeeded in limiting the government's ability to provide financial bailouts to insurers through the risk-corridor system. This move was spearheaded by Senator Marco Rubio, who argued that such bailouts would unfairly burden taxpayers.  The risk-corridor program, a component of the healthcare law, was initially created to protect insurers against financial losses. Although Rubio's attempts to eliminate the program entirely were unsuccessful, his efforts did result in a policy rider being included in a spending bill passed in 2014. This provision restricted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from using funds from other accounts, such as overall appropriations or Medicare funding, to support the risk corridors program.  While HHS has yet to receive the full $7.7 billion designated for reinsurance payments, it is expected to accumulate this amount by the end of 2016. The Obama Administration is hopeful that this financial support will alleviate the strain faced by insurers and encourage their continued participation in ObamaCare.  The fate of ObamaCare remains uncertain, with ongoing debates surrounding its efficacy and financial sustainability. As insurers continue to grapple with mounting losses, the government's commitment to provide financial assistance may be a significant factor in determining the program's future.”X§
  Obama-Clinton Diversity Balkanization: Dilute First, Then Divide and Conquer  HOUSTON, TX - In a rally called The Remembrance Luncheon, Donald Trump addressed the issue of illegal immigration and its impact on American families who have lost loved ones. Trump criticized Hillary Clinton and the Democrats for ignoring these victims, arguing that their refusal to acknowledge the dangers of open borders is a direct result of their desire to maintain a false narrative. By acknowledging the devastating consequences of open borders, Clinton and her allies, including Obama, Johnson, Soros, and Clinton herself, would have to admit that their policies are endangering innocent American lives.  At the heart of Trump's critique is the notion that open borders not only pose a threat to American citizens but also undermine the very fabric of the nation. Trump accused Clinton of advocating for the abolition of borders, suggesting that this stance aligns with the agenda of globalists who seek to weaken and ultimately destroy America. He highlighted Clinton's support for a lifetime of welfare and entitlements, arguing that this is not motivated by genuine compassion but rather by the globalist agenda to financially ruin the nation.  Trump's assertion that a country without borders is no longer a country is a sentiment he has expressed consistently throughout his campaign. However, it is essential to delve into the specifics of this threat. While the impact of open borders is felt nationwide, the border itself is the epicenter of the conflict. Trump warned that the globalists have a similar vision for America as they do for Europe, where unelected bureaucrats in Brussels hold power over once-sovereign nations. In this vision, travel between nations is unrestricted, leading to uncontrolled migration and overwhelming the wealthier countries.  If Clinton and the globalists have their way, the United States would follow a similar path. Their ultimate goal is to eliminate the U.S. as an independent entity and merge it into a North American Union. Under this system, a resident of Tijuana, Mexico, could easily move to San Diego and become a global citizen. This individual might initially work for cash, undercutting and replacing American workers. They would have no allegiance to the new nation, seeing it as a remnant of colonialist oppression.  The concerns raised by Trump go beyond crimes against innocent Americans and economic devastation; they touch on the very essence of national identity and sovereignty. The push for diversity and tolerance, while important, should not come at the expense of diluting and eroding the nation's borders. Trump's message resonates with those who fear the loss of American”X­
  "What Followers of Islam Say About Being Asked to Snitch on the Neighbors"  In an effort to uncover potential threats within American communities, authorities have called upon citizens to remain vigilant and anonymously report any suspicious activity to the FBI. This practice, akin to the tip that led to the capture of the UniBomber Ted Kaczynski, aims to prevent acts of terrorism. The same appeal has been extended to members of mosques and individuals residing in Muslim communities across the country. However, this request has been met with mixed reactions.  While some argue that singling out the Muslim community for this responsibility is unfair, others believe it is a necessary measure to ensure the safety of all Americans. Palestinian American activist Linda Sarsour, known for her work with the Black Lives Matter movement, expresses her opposition to this exclusive focus on Muslims. She questions why other faith communities are not similarly asked to denounce violence committed by individuals within their groups.  On the other hand, Shahed Amanullah, a Muslim American entrepreneur based in Washington, D.C., acknowledges the need to combat extremism but believes it is unrealistic to expect Muslim Americans to confront potentially violent individuals in their midst. Amanullah, who has collaborated with the U.S. government in combating online extremism, argues that Muslim Americans should have the same relationship with law enforcement as any other citizen.  While these perspectives highlight concerns about the burden placed on the Muslim community, there are also individuals within the community who support the FBI's request. Small business entrepreneurs, in particular, view the violence associated with extremism as a barrier to achieving the American dream. They are sympathetic to the law enforcement's call for cooperation, even though some may only pay lip service to it. Notably, one individual quoted in the article, who has been in the U.S. for 25 years, emphasizes that the expectation for Muslims to do more than other religious groups is widely felt.  Hamad Hahsy, an Afghan immigrant operating a kebab restaurant in South Philadelphia, believes that it is everyone's duty, regardless of religious affiliation, to confront extremism. He sees it as a duty of all Americans, stating that he told his wife, "You're not Afghan anymore."  The question of whether the Muslim community should bear a unique responsibility in combatting terrorism continues to provoke debate. While some argue that it is unjust to single out Muslims, others believe that collective effort is crucial in maintaining national security. Ultimately, the goal remains to ensure the safety and well-being of all Americans.”Xz  Opinion | A Call for Dialogue: Seeking Solutions to Our Nation's Challenges  By [Author's Name]  In this age of constant political turmoil, it is all too easy to succumb to frustration and resort to yelling at our television screens. Yet, perhaps it is time we redirect our voices towards those who hold the power to effect change. We all possess ideas and opinions regarding the problems confronting our great nation, and it is through sharing them that we may uncover potential solutions.   Reflecting on the enduring issue of immigration reform, one cannot help but wonder why this topic continues to dominate our political discourse, even 34 years after Ronald Reagan first broached the subject in 1980. With each election cycle, we witness promises made by candidates, only to be followed by years of inaction. This predictable dance has become an unwelcome tradition.   So, one might ask, what if you were the President? What would you do to tackle this pressing issue?   The time has come for us to engage in a substantive dialogue about the challenges facing our nation. Shouting at our television sets accomplishes little. Instead, we should turn our attention towards meaningful conversations with one another and with our elected officials.   It is crucial to recognize that the path to progress lies in sharing our perspectives, listening to alternative viewpoints, and working collectively towards solutions. The New York Times invites readers to join in this endeavor by contributing their voices to the ongoing discourse.   Together, let us forge a future where ideas are exchanged, solutions are sought, and our great nation can move forward.”Xˆ
  State Department Lacked Inspector General During Benghazi and Clinton Private Email Controversy  During President Barack Obama's first term, a critical oversight occurred that received little attention at the time: the failure to nominate Attorneys General to monitor his cabinet departments. A simple internet search reveals numerous stories from 2011 to 2013 expressing concern over the lack of oversight for cabinet members and their activities. This lapse in administrative responsibility is particularly significant now as we discover that the State Department had no inspector general while Hillary Clinton served as secretary, leaving her and her staff without non-partisan oversight.  The White House contends that it is the State Department's responsibility to ensure that their officials and staff adhere to the law. However, it is the White House's duty to provide the necessary tools for such oversight, and they failed in this regard by neglecting to appoint an inspector general. John Wonderlich, policy director at the non-partisan open-government group Sunlight Foundation, criticized the Obama Administration for not providing the State Department with the crucial tool of an inspector general.  This lack of oversight meant that there was no one for whistleblowers to turn to with concerns about Benghazi or any other scandals that arose during Clinton's time as secretary. The absence of this essential component of transparent and ethical governance was a significant flaw. Inspectors general are meant to act as independent watchdogs within federal agencies, safeguarding against waste, corruption, and violations of the law, while also protecting whistleblowers.  In the first four and a half years of Obama's presidency, no one was appointed to the top State Department inspector general position. It was only after the terrorist attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans and drew attention to the vacancy, that the president finally took action. This delay raises questions about the Obama Administration's knowledge of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for sensitive exchanges, both with foreign entities and American officials. With no inspector general in place, there was no one to inform either party that this was not only unwise but also illegal. This is precisely the role of an inspector general.  Whether due to a lack of understanding of the importance of this position or a deliberate circumvention of transparency and ethics controls, the Obama Administration's failure to address this issue has now led to a brewing scandal that could harm the Democratic Party's hold on power in the near future.”X×  Jon Voight Criticizes Reporter for Distorting Truth  In an impromptu interview, actor and American patriot Jon Voight was asked about his thoughts on Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, by a clearly liberal questioner. The questioning was done in a manner reflective of the mainstream media's typical method of operation, using distorted phrasing and Clinton talking points. One question asked about Trump's comments regarding Hillary Clinton and another about possible assassination.  Rather than correcting the reporter's misquotes or exposing his lack of preparedness, Voight chose to address the questions as they were. He stated that these issues were being blown out of proportion and that people were trying to make Trump look foolish. Voight, who knows Trump personally, described him as a terrific guy with a good sense of humor.  Despite Voight's response, the line of questioning continued, clearly indicating TMZ's desire for a headline that bashes Trump. The next question asked whether it was irresponsible for anyone to joke about assassinating a presidential candidate. Voight corrected the reporter, saying that Trump did not use that word and urged him not to distort what was said. He emphasized that Trump was merely fooling around and that people with a sense of humor sometimes do the same.  The reporter then asked if Trump needed to clarify his statements, to which Voight responded by highlighting the continuous attacks on Trump and how everything he does is scrutinized. Voight praised a recent speech made by Trump, urging everyone to listen to it as it addresses important issues and provides solutions.  The reporter made one final attempt, asking whether Trump's comment about "Second Amendment people" was dog-whistle politics. Voight recognized the reporter's agenda and the scripted nature of his talking points, responding that he didn't know where the words were coming from and jokingly suggesting a physical confrontation to settle the matter.  Voight's strong rebuttals showcased his frustration with the reporter's distortions and the continuous attacks on Trump. He warned that such misrepresentations could lead to trouble, highlighting the biased nature of the reporter and his delivery of DNC talking points.”Xì  Ferguson Protesters Storm City Hall and Exclusive Mall  FERGUSON, Mo. â€” Following the official protest in Ferguson earlier today, where a few hundred individuals marched on the local police department, dozens of young demonstrators congregated at the Soldiers War Memorial downtown. The memorial, dedicated to those who lost their lives in World War II, served as the starting point for a march through a public park and Market Street towards St. Louis City Hall.  As reported by StLtoday and Fox 2 News, the protesters went through a thorough security check, one by one, before entering the rotunda of City Hall. Inside, they chanted slogans and drew attention to their cause. However, one person was apprehended when they attempted to hang a banner on an antique globe within the historic building.  Meanwhile, approximately 25 individuals from a local group called Millennial Activists United gathered at Plaza Frontenac, an upscale mall located around twelve miles west on Highway 40. This mall houses luxury stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman-Marcus, Coach, Williams Sonoma, and Talbots. Alexis Templeton, one of the group's leaders, explained their motive for choosing this location, stating, "This is a wealthy and privileged area. We wanted to march here in order to bridge the gap between our realities." Another organizer, Jamell Spann, added, "We aimed to make people uncomfortable, just as we feel uncomfortable every day."  Critics argue that by targeting yet another mall predominantly frequented by white individuals, the protesters are merely perpetuating a divisive narrative. However, it appears that these demonstrations are only the beginning, as the professional agitators behind them continue to gain momentum. Stay tuned for further updates.”X©
  "Nanny Bloomberg Takes Aim at Gun Owners' Rights in the Wild West - Nevada in His Crosshairs  No corner of America is safe from the iron grip of control-freak Michael Bloomberg, not even the vast expanse of the American West. The people who inhabit these remote areas cherish their independence and yearn to be free from the meddling hands of individuals like Bloomberg. They simply desire to live their lives without interference, forging their own paths. However, Bloomberg has set his sights on making it increasingly difficult for these individuals to defend themselves, regardless of the threat they may face. Nevada, a state dangerously close to the liberal stronghold of California, has become a fertile ground for Bloomberg's Democratic socialist agenda. With a significant Hispanic population, the state is ripe for his transformative vision of the United States, which includes dismantling the Second Amendment.  Bloomberg, a progressive with immense wealth, operates through a series of incremental steps to achieve his goals. A crucial element of his assault on our gun rights is the implementation of a national gun registry. Through his organization, Everytown for Gun Safety, Bloomberg is funneling funds into a gun control campaign that seeks to mandate background checks for private firearm transfers, gun show sales, and even sales or gifting among family members. Thankfully, Nevada narrowly escaped a similar fate in 2013 due to the veto by Republican Governor Brian Sandoval. However, a new initiative is being pushed to place a gun registry bill on the 2016 ballot. The initiative poses the question: 'Should unlicensed firearms dealers be allowed to sell guns without conducting background checks?' The wording of this question is likely to elicit reflexive support from many voters, who may fail to consider the broader implications. Unfortunately, not all voters are critical thinkers and can easily be manipulated.  The group benefiting from Bloomberg's financial support is the Nevada Network Against Domestic Violence, which operates across all 17 counties in the state. Susan Meuschke, the executive director of this organization, insists that their objective is not to create a gun registry, but rather, a registry would be an integral part of their efforts to promote gun safety. Meuschke contends that the issue at hand revolves around suicide prevention, law enforcement, and keeping firearms away from dangerous individuals. However, the argument that gun control is necessary and reasonable in the name of safety is flawed. While Meuschke acknowledges that criminals will always find a way to obtain guns, she falls back on the argument that if even one life is saved, it is worth it. Yet, this”XD	  Fans of Wrongly Accused Man Ignite Firestorm, Urging Obama to Grant Freedom  In a fervent display of support, fans of Steve Avery, a man they believe to be wrongly accused, have launched a campaign to persuade President Obama to set him free. These avid viewers of the popular Netflix documentary series "Making a Murderer" argue that the show sheds light on Avery's innocence. Over 180,000 individuals have signed petitions urging the president to pardon Avery, whose case revolves around his arrest and conviction for the murder of photographer Teresa Halbach.  The documentary delves into the pivotal events surrounding Avery's case, starting with his original conviction for sexual assault in 1985. After serving 18 years, Avery was exonerated in 2003 due to DNA evidence. However, just two years later, he found himself back in custody, this time accused of murder. Astonishingly, Avery went from being a well-known exoneree to an alleged killer. Prosecutors claimed that he murdered Halbach, who had visited his residence to photograph a van for Auto Trader magazine on October 31, 2005.  Avery, along with his nephew Brendan Dassey, who was also implicated in the murder, is currently serving a life sentence without parole in a Wisconsin penitentiary. The New York Times reports that Avery's unconstitutional treatment at the hands of corrupt local law enforcement is seen as a flagrant violation of due process. A petition on Change.org, which has amassed approximately 164,000 signatures, decries this abominable treatment and demands justice for Avery.  In addition to seeking Avery's pardon, petitioners are also calling on President Obama to pardon Dassey, who was convicted separately for sexual assault and aiding in the murder. Citing the evidence presented in the Netflix documentary series, the petition argues that the justice system has tragically failed both men, leaving their lives irreparably shattered.  With 19,500 petitions already submitted to the White House website, supporters hope to reach the 100,000 signature threshold by January 19th to compel a response from the administration. The case of Steve Avery and Brendan Dassey has captivated audiences and ignited a fierce debate about the flaws in the criminal justice system. As fans of "Making a Murderer" push for justice, the fate of these two men hangs in the balance.  H/T: The Blaze”XŸ  Watch: Louis Farrakhan Insults Rudy Guiliani and Provokes Anger in America  Louis Farrakhan, a controversial figure known for his divisive rhetoric, recently made derogatory remarks about former New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani at Saviours Day on February 22. As an individual with Irish roots who immigrated to the United States to escape oppression, I find Farrakhan's version of events deeply disturbing. It is important to shed light on his inflammatory comments and correct the record.  Under normal circumstances, Farrakhan's words should not be given any attention. However, when he insults the American people, spreads falsehoods, and attacks the character of a dedicated public servant like Guiliani, it is necessary to expose his rhetoric. It is worth noting that Farrakhan is an American Islamic convert, and his remarks seem to be an attempt to defend former President Barack Obama. In fact, Representative Keith Ellison, a prominent Muslim from Minnesota, recently echoed similar sentiments in support of Obama.  Farrakhan's use of racial slurs, such as "cracker" and the N-word, is both offensive and unacceptable. It is disheartening to witness such hateful language being used by someone who claims to fight against racial inequality. It is important to remember the contributions of Native Americans to this country, rather than engaging in divisive rhetoric.  Farrakhan's words reflect not just stupidity, but also deep-seated hate, racism, and mental deficiencies. These individuals think so poorly of themselves that they seek power over others. It is a sad and pitiful mentality that should not be supported or encouraged.  Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that Farrakhan's ideology aligns with that of former President Obama. Farrakhan has received awards from the church where Obama attended for 20 years, led by Reverend Jeremiah Wright. While this church claimed to be Christian, its teachings did not align with the true Word of God.  In conclusion, Farrakhan's recent remarks about Rudy Guiliani and his divisive rhetoric serve only to further fuel the flames of racial division. It is essential to reject such hateful language and focus on building a united and inclusive society.”XZ	  Title: EPA Chief Declares End to Dialogue with Climate Skeptics  In a recent announcement, Gina McCarthy, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), declared that she will no longer engage in discussions with climate skeptics. McCarthy, known for her firm stance on environmental issues, stated that her side has emerged victorious in the ongoing debate and that those who deny the existence of climate change are no longer worth her time.  McCarthy's decision comes as no surprise, given the unwavering support she has received from President Obama, who has repeatedly emphasized that the scientific consensus on climate change is settled. During a Facebook interview with Mashable, McCarthy expressed her frustration with climate deniers, stating, "If they haven't figured out by now, what in God's name could anyone say to them?"  The EPA chief firmly asserted, "I don't check out flat Earth society, and I'm not talking to climate deniers. That's it." McCarthy acknowledged that although she is expected to serve as an advocate for all Americans, her patience has worn thin over the past eight years.  Critics argue that McCarthy's decision reflects the typical closed-mindedness often associated with proponents of global government policies. Her defense of the EPA's war on coal and its economic consequences has also come under scrutiny. McCarthy asserted that the damage caused by the EPA did not begin under the previous administration, but rather has been an ongoing issue.  While McCarthy may view climate skeptics as abnormal, it is important to note that there are many who question the prevailing narrative on climate change. The Daily Caller reported that in a speech given in 2015, McCarthy stated that "normal people, not global warming skeptics, would win the climate debate." However, this perspective fails to recognize that individuals who question the prevailing scientific consensus come from diverse backgrounds and political affiliations.  Although McCarthy's decision to disengage from climate skeptics may disappoint those seeking open dialogue, it is clear that she has chosen to align herself with like-minded individuals within her own political circle. While McCarthy's tenure at the EPA has been marked by controversy, it is important to continue fostering discussions that promote a well-rounded understanding of climate change and its implications.”Xõ  American Power Grid Vulnerable to Cyber Attacks, Experts Say  In a recent interview with former NSA Deputy Training Director Col. Cedric Leighton, the alarming vulnerability of the American power grid to cyber attacks was discussed. Leighton emphasized the urgent need for both physical and cyber security measures to protect the grid, pointing out the lack of action from Congress in this regard.  Currently, there is a bill pending in Congress that aims to facilitate the sharing of malware signatures. However, its progress has been hindered by the revelations made by Edward Snowden, making its passage a challenging task.  Leighton's remarks were prompted by the testimony given on Capitol Hill by Admiral Michael Rogers, the current National Security Administration Director. Rogers highlighted that countries like China, along with a few others, are rapidly advancing their capabilities in cyberspace, potentially enabling them to disable the American power grid.  These revelations shed light on the pressing need for increased security measures to safeguard the American power grid. The potential consequences of a cyber attack on the grid are immense, and it is imperative for Congress to take swift and decisive action to protect our national infrastructure.”XS  Susan Rice, the National Security Advisor under President Obama, has come under scrutiny for her involvement in the foreign policy failures of the previous administration. Critics argue that her micromanagement of the growth of ISIS and her role in destabilizing Libya have had detrimental effects on global security. With a track record like hers, some suggest that Rice should focus on solving Rubik's Cubes rather than offering advice on national security.  In the private sector, Rice's tenure and the associated damage would likely have been limited, if she had even been hired in the first place. However, working in the federal government under the Obama regime seems to reward failure, destruction, and irresponsibility. Instead of facing consequences, Rice finds herself on stage, giving speeches to young Air Force Cadets.  Rice recently spoke at the Air Force Academy, where she lectured cadets on the battle against ISIS. She argued that in order to defeat the terrorist group's ideology, the United States must offer a more compelling vision. Critics view this as politically correct drivel and argue that the terrorists' actions are not a result of a lack of vision, but rather a lack of morals, character, and humanity. They assert that the only way to defeat ISIS is by eliminating them, not by coddling or bribing them.  Rice's emphasis on sustainable development and economic opportunities as a means to combat terrorism is seen by some as a ploy to implement Marxist global redistribution of wealth under the UN global government. Skeptics argue that Rice is essentially suggesting that in order to stop terrorism, the United States must give in to the demands of terrorists.  Overall, Rice's approach to national security and foreign policy has raised concerns among critics who believe that her strategies have led to a more formidable and capable adversary. They argue that it is essential to recognize and engage the enemy, rather than offering empty gestures or bribes. The future, they assert, belongs to those who build, but it also requires a strong and decisive stance against those who seek to destroy.”Xu
  Ted Cruz Denies Kasich Collusion, Blames Media in Fiorina Announcement  In a press briefing on April 28th, following the announcement of Carly Fiorina as his running mate, Ted Cruz faced questions about the impact this decision would have on his alliance with John Kasich. The reporter highlighted the contradictory statements made by both candidates regarding their support for the alliance, as well as Fiorina's apparent order for Kasich to exit the race. Cruz, desperate for victory and willing to take any means necessary, denied the existence of any alliance and placed blame on the media for the misperception.  Dismissive of the media's enthusiasm to discuss the alliance, Cruz aloofly stated, "I recognize that the media is all eager to talk about an alliance. There is no alliance." However, he then proceeded to describe what is essentially an alliance, contradicting his initial denial. This is a notable departure from Cruz's usual habit of assigning blame solely to Donald Trump. He acknowledged that he and Kasich had made decisions on where to focus their energies, assets, and resources, while praising Kasich as a good and honorable man, a sentiment that many find laughable given Cruz's own actions.  Attempting to reshape the narrative in a less damaging way, Cruz claimed that Kasich had made the decision to withdraw from Indiana and compete elsewhere in his own political self-interest. This conveniently ignores the fact that Cruz had chosen to align himself with Fiorina after Kasich had already conceded Indiana, effectively betraying Kasich's trust. The Cruz-Kasich alliance serves as a cautionary tale about the inherent risk of entering into a strategic partnership, especially when it involves one's opponent. However, Cruz, the self-proclaimed devout Christian conservative, would never engage in underhanded tactics, or so he would have us believe.   Moving on to his campaign's main concern, Cruz urged voters to support him, particularly those who had previously backed Kasich. He portrayed Kasich's decision as reasonable and made a plea for their support. Cruz's denial of the alliance is contradicted by his own campaign manager, Jeff Roe, who had publicly announced the alliance, stating that their campaign would focus on Indiana while clearing the path for Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico. It remains unclear what word Cruz and Roe would prefer to use for this arrangement, considering its definition clearly aligns with the term "alliance."  In the end, Cruz's attempt to deny the existence of the alliance and shift blame onto the media is undermined by his own campaign manager's statement. The Fiorina announcement, coupled”Xõ	  California Muslim Arrested for Disturbing Murder of Mother  In a shocking and horrifying incident, 31-year-old Omar Pettigen confessed to the murder of his mother, 64-year-old Nailah Pettigen, in their California home. The gruesome details of this crime have left many stunned, yet the media's coverage of the case has been notably sparse. According to court documents, Omar admitted to killing his mother and even went as far as cutting out her heart. However, what he did next is equally disturbing.  Omar claimed that the incident occurred during an argument with his mother, during which she allegedly pointed a gun at him. In response, he grabbed a hammer from the bedroom wall and knocked the gun out of her hand. After leaving the room, he returned armed with a tomahawk, which he used to brutally bash her head. Omar then retrieved a revolver from a closet and shot her repeatedly in the back. As she lay dying, he proceeded to slice open her chest with a knife and remove her heart with his bare hands. Shockingly, he then masturbated on her lifeless body, claiming that he needed a release following the event.  Reportedly, Pettigen told the police that his motive for murdering his mother was her addiction to prescription painkillers, specifically oxycodone. Nailah Pettigen had recently become dependent on the drug due to hip and knee problems, as well as surgery. It is worth noting that Islam strictly prohibits the use of narcotics, categorizing them as haraam, or unlawful. The religion also imposes corporal punishment on individuals who consume alcohol or engage in gambling.  While a few online sources have covered this gruesome story, they have failed to mention Omar Pettigen's devout adherence to Islam. The family has claimed that they noticed a change in his behavior since his return from Morocco a few months prior to the murder. Islam is the predominant religion in Morocco, with over 99% of the population following it.  During the police interview, Pettigen remained calm and showed no signs of remorse, according to authorities. In fact, one detective reported that Omar expressed satisfaction with his actions. After committing this heinous act, Pettigen proceeded to have a few beers with friends in the San Francisco Bay area and even booked an airline ticket for Chicago.  As the investigation continues, the disturbing nature of this crime has left many questioning how such a horrific incident could occur. The media's relative silence on the matter has only added to the mystery surrounding this tragic event.”Xi   Apocalyptic fervor has seen a remarkable surge in recent years, with the concept of a Zombie Apocalypse reigning supreme over other cataclysmic scenarios such as nuclear war and pandemics. The Walking Dead, World War Z, and a plethora of cable television shows and specials centered around apocalyptic themes have captivated audiences and continue to gain momentum. However, the underlying reasons for this fascination remain largely subconscious and elusive.  In a recent interview, prominent Leftist activist and agitator Noam Chomsky was asked to shed light on the preoccupation with the apocalypse and zombies in our culture. Agreeing with the notion that the focus on zombies reflects a nation gripped by fear and desperation, Chomsky couldn't resist the urge to attribute this obsession to America's alleged role in perpetuating ills, both real and imagined. Citing Bruce Franklin's book War Stars, Chomsky traced the history of fear in popular culture and identified recurring themes: the imminent threat of destruction by a formidable enemy, salvation at the eleventh hour through a superhero or super weapon, and the revelation that this enemy is one that we ourselves oppress. Chomsky posited that this collective subconscious recognition of the consequences of oppression and the fear of invented dangers contribute to the country's fixation on a Zombie Apocalypse.  While Chomsky's attempt to explain the nation's fascination with the Zombie Apocalypse may seem plausible to some, it falls short of capturing the true essence of the phenomenon. Indeed, beneath the surface lies a vast undercurrent of suspicion, unease, paranoia, division, worry, pain, and even trauma that permeates the national consciousness. It is this deeply rooted unease that finds expression in the popularity of zombie-themed entertainment and the overarching concept of a doomsday scenario in popular culture.”Xv
  Pentagon Unable to Account for $6.5 Trillion, Failing to Comply with Annual Audit Requirement  In 1996, Congress passed a law mandating that all government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD), conduct an annual audit. However, a recent report from the Office of Inspector General reveals that the Pentagon has not yet complied with this requirement. Consequently, the DoD has no knowledge of the whereabouts of a staggering $6.5 trillion. This alarming revelation comes on the heels of previous admissions by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who admitted the disappearance of $2.3 trillion from the Defense Department budget just prior to the 9/11 attacks. Since then, this figure has ballooned to $6.5 trillion and continues to grow.  The report highlights the inadequate support provided by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management Comptroller) (OASA[FMC]) and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Indianapolis (DFAS Indianapolis) for $2.8 trillion in third quarter journal voucher adjustments and $6.5 trillion in year-end journal voucher adjustments made to AGF data during the 2015 fiscal year financial statement compilation. The auditors attribute these unsupported adjustments to OASA(FMC) and DFAS Indianapolis failing to prioritize the correction of system deficiencies and neglecting to provide sufficient guidance for supporting system-generated adjustments.  This lack of accountability within the Pentagon's financial management has been known for at least fifteen years, thanks to the work of economists such as Martin Armstrong and news outlets like the Financial Times. Yet, despite these revelations, little has changed over the years. In fact, it has emerged that the Navy had an individual responsible for inputting numbers into the budget without any means to substantiate them. A Reuters investigation uncovered the fact that for two decades, the U.S. military has evaded an audit, thereby violating federal law and concealing waste and fraud amounting to billions of dollars. Linda Woodford, an accountant at the U.S. Department of Defense, spent the final 15 years of her career fabricating numbers in the agency's accounts. Each month, the Navy would provide data to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service in Cleveland, Ohio, where Woodford and her colleagues would prepare monthly reports to reconcile the Navy's records with those of the U.S. Treasury. However, they consistently encountered issues such as missing numbers, incorrect figures, and a lack of explanations regarding the expenditure of funds or the congressional appropriations from which they originated.  While this lack”•     Xá
  Piling Onto The Clinton Scandals: What Hillary And The Family Foundation Didn't Tell Obama  Reports from various news organizations, both conservative and non-partisan, are all echoing the same sentiment: Hillary Clinton supporters, even at the grassroots level, are growing increasingly uneasy. With each passing day, a new scandal surfaces or fresh details emerge about an existing one, painting a rather unfavorable picture of the former Secretary of State. Just last week, her disastrous press conference regarding her private email server dominated headlines. And now, it appears that Clinton had promised to keep the Obama Administration informed about the donors to the Clinton Foundation, but failed to do so after 2010.  On Thursday of this week, Reuters broke the exclusive story, revealing that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) should have disclosed its donors between 2010 and 2013, when Clinton held office. Maura Daley, a CHAI spokeswoman, acknowledged this oversight and explained that they rectified the situation this year by publishing the donor lists. Unfortunately, neither of the Clintons could be reached for comment as they are currently occupied with their busy travel schedules.  Given the absence of an Inspector General at the State Department during Clinton's tenure and the multiple instances outlined in the Reuters report of foreign governments donating to the Clinton Foundation or CHAI without any donor disclosure between 2010 and 2013, it is possible that these operations were conducted with innocent intentions, aiming to improve global circumstances. However, the optics of the situation are undeniably unfavorable for Hillary. This scandal, though seemingly minor, would undoubtedly be blown out of proportion if the person responsible were a Republican.  The silver lining in these scandals is that Clinton's grassroots supporters are finally reconsidering their allegiance to her presidential campaign. If she attempts to brush off these scandals, it raises concerns about what other questionable actions she might engage in. More on this topic can be found at Personal Liberty.  Regardless of how many laws Clinton bends or breaks, there will always be individuals foolish enough to vote for her. Just look at President Obama, who was reelected despite proving to be both a traitor and a liar. This blind loyalty enables Clinton to act with impunity, as people will still try to position her as Obama's successor. If the Democratic Party could collectively employ some rational thinking, they would cease to exist entirely. It is evident that Democrats harbor a deep disdain for America and seek its destruction; electing Clinton would only expedite this outcome. After eight years of Obama, the American populace has grown tired of”Xº
  Illegal Immigrant Arrested for Brutal Rape of 10-Year-Old in Texas, Prompting Debate on Immigration Policies  In a shocking incident that has reignited the debate on immigration policies, an illegal immigrant was arrested for the brutal rape of a 10-year-old girl in McGregor, Texas. Ruben Hernandez-Nunez, a 27-year-old undocumented immigrant, was apprehended by the police after the young victim came forward with her ordeal. The authorities charged Hernandez-Nunez with sexual assault of a child under the age of 14, as well as tampering with government documents using a stolen social security number.  This case has drawn attention to the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in dealing with undocumented individuals who commit crimes. In May 2013, Hernandez-Nunez was arrested for criminal mischief, during which it was discovered that he was in the country illegally. However, due to limitations within the federal system, local authorities had no authority to initiate deportation proceedings. Steve Foster, Chief of the McGregor police department, expressed his frustration with this situation, stating that they would have preferred to see Hernandez-Nunez deported. He highlighted the lack of control local authorities have over federal immigration policies.  Adding to the controversy, Hernandez-Nunez was sentenced to five years in prison for his previous offense, but an immigration judge, following guidelines set by the Obama administration, allowed him to post bail instead of being deported. This decision by the immigration judge has raised questions about the effectiveness of the current immigration policies and the need for stricter enforcement.  Critics argue that this incident underscores the need for a stronger immigration system that prioritizes the safety of American citizens. Ann Coulter, a prominent conservative figure, faced backlash when she expressed her concerns about undocumented immigrants in an interview with Jorge Ramos, stating that Americans should fear immigrants more than ISIS. She argued that the government needs to take a stronger stance on immigration to protect innocent Americans.  The liberal media has been accused of selectively covering this issue, giving more airtime to controversial comments by Coulter while neglecting stories such as this one. The brutal rape of a child by an undocumented immigrant raises questions about the prioritization of public safety and the need for comprehensive immigration reform.  As the nation grapples with the complexities of immigration policies, incidents like this serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for a thoughtful and effective approach to balancing compassion for immigrants with the safety and security of American citizens.”X£
  Muslim Truck Drivers Awarded $240K in Beer Delivery Lawsuit  In a recent ruling, Judge James E. Shadid of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois awarded two Somali-American truck drivers $240,000 after they were fired by Star Transport for refusing to transport loads of beer due to their religious beliefs. The case, pursued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), concluded with compensatory and punitive damages and back pay being awarded to the drivers.  Mahad Abass Mohamed (formerly known as Mahad Aden) and Abdkiarim Hassan Bulshale (formerly known as Abdikarim Ismail) were each granted $20,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in punitive damages by the jury. Judge Shadid also awarded them approximately $1,500 each in back pay. Star Transport had previously accepted liability earlier in the year, making this phase of the trial solely focused on determining the appropriate compensation.  David Lopez, General Counsel for the EEOC, expressed pride in supporting the rights of workers to equal treatment in the workplace while maintaining their religious beliefs. He stated that this commitment to religious freedom and tolerance is fundamental to American principles. June Calhoun, the EEOC attorney who litigated the case, emphasized the importance of the verdict in holding employers accountable for discriminatory practices and addressing the injustice faced by the drivers. She also highlighted that this decision reaffirms religious freedom as a right for all Americans.  Judge Andrew Napolitano, a well-known libertarian legal figure, weighed in on the case, expressing his belief that the federal government intervened in order to make a point. He also questioned why the drivers did not seek alternative employment if their religious beliefs were at risk of being violated. Napolitano's comments highlighted the ongoing debate surrounding religious freedom and the balance between accommodating religious beliefs and protecting individuals from discrimination.  It is crucial to note that this case is distinct from other recent controversies involving religious beliefs and business practices, such as the case of Christian bakers refusing to provide wedding cakes for same-sex couples. The ruling in this beer delivery lawsuit serves as a reminder that religious freedom is a right that extends to all Americans.  In summary, the ruling in this case has sparked discussions about religious freedom, discrimination in the workplace, and the responsibilities of employers to accommodate employees' religious beliefs. The verdict sends a clear message to Star Transport and other employers that they will be held accountable for any unlawful employment practices.”X¶
  Syrian Refugees: Crisis or Media-Driven European Invasion?  LESBOS, Greece â€” In the midst of fleeing their war-torn homeland, one might assume that Syrian refugees would prioritize essential items over a selfie stick. However, as their presence dominates headlines, skepticism arises regarding the media's portrayal of this humanitarian crisis as a European invasion.   The flood of individuals seeking refuge from the prolonged civil war in Syria, where those opposing President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies face destruction, has stirred guilt within Europe, compelling them to open their doors. Yet, recent revelations have shed light on cracks in this prevailing narrative. Weaselzippers, a news outlet, has compiled a list that challenges the poster story of sympathy â€“ the tragic drowning of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi.   The image of the deceased child cradled by a first responder undoubtedly tugged at heartstrings, but it is worth considering the dramatic nature of the people involved. After all, they are Muslims, and drama is an integral part of their lives. While it is reprehensible to risk children's lives for adult desires, it is important to acknowledge that these individuals adhere to beliefs that condone suicide bombing.   "But, CL," a reader might ask, "aren't there Christians among the refugees? After all, they are persecuted in the Middle East." Yes, there are Christians seeking refuge, but statistics reveal that over 80% of migrants heading to Germany are Muslim. The Gatestone Institute further reports that in 2015 alone, 4,205 Muslims were admitted to the United States from Iraq, compared to only 727 Christians. This disparity is mirrored across the Western world. While Iraq is not Syria, it raises questions regarding the denial and subsequent detention of Christian refugees.   The images of countless individuals walking to the Austrian border through Hungary make for captivating photography and compelling narratives. Yet, the leaders of Hungary and Austria, acting as bullies, insist that these migrants remain. They essentially squat in European countries, violating European Union laws, all while en route to Germany. Instead of reporting to refugee camps as expected, they fear deportation and refuse to comply.   These circumstances prompt us to question the authenticity of the Syrian refugee movement. Is it genuinely driven by individuals in dire need, or are we falling for a narrative that plays on the sympathies of well-intentioned individuals, ultimately leading to the acceptance of economically disadvantaged migrants into nominally Christian Europe? The sheer number of Muslims found with smartphones upon washing ashore is quite staggering, particularly considering that”X|  Former President George W. Bush, like countless fellow citizens, fulfilled his civic duty by reporting for jury duty. The unassuming act of serving as a jury member is an integral part of the routine for an average American.

  Cloudy Headlights: A Simple Solution to Enhance Road Safety  In an era where road safety remains a pressing concern, one particular issue often overlooked is the gradual deterioration of vehicle headlights. Cloudy headlights not only diminish visibility, but they also compromise the overall appearance of a car. However, fret not, for a simple and cost-effective solution exists to restore these foggy lenses to their former glory.  The first step towards tackling this problem is understanding the underlying cause. Over time, the protective coating on headlights can wear off due to exposure to sunlight, harsh weather conditions, or the accumulation of dirt and debris. As a result, the plastic lens becomes dull and cloudy, reducing the amount of light emitted and hampering visibility during nighttime drives.  To combat this issue, a life hack has emerged as a game-changer for motorists worldwide. The secret ingredient? Toothpaste. Yes, you read that correctly. A regular tube of toothpaste, coupled with some elbow grease, can work wonders in restoring clarity to cloudy headlights.  Begin by thoroughly cleaning the surface of the headlight lens, removing any dirt or grime. Once clean, apply a small amount of toothpaste directly onto a soft cloth or sponge. Gently rub the toothpaste onto the lens using circular motions. The mild abrasives in toothpaste help remove the hazy layer, revealing a cleaner and clearer surface beneath. After a few minutes of scrubbing, wipe away the excess toothpaste with a clean cloth and rinse the lens with water. VoilÃ ! The headlights should now appear significantly clearer, allowing for improved visibility on the road.  It is important to note that not all toothpastes are created equal in this regard. Opt for a non-gel, non-whitening toothpaste, as these tend to have more abrasive properties that aid in removing the cloudiness. Additionally, while this method is effective for mild to moderate cloudiness, severe cases may require professional assistance or a headlight restoration kit.  This handy trick not only saves car owners the expense of replacing their cloudy headlights but also contributes to road safety by ensuring optimal visibility. Moreover, it is a sustainable solution that repurposes a common household item, reducing waste and environmental impact.  As with any life hack, it is crucial to exercise caution and common sense. Always test the toothpaste on a small, inconspicuous area of the headlight first to ensure it does not cause any damage. Furthermore, this method is not a permanent fix, as the cloudiness may gradually return over time. Regular maintenance and”XÂ  Rapper's Death Threats Against Trump Backfire  Death threats against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump have become a disturbing reality in recent times. One such incident involved talk show host Glenn Beck, who mentioned something about stabbing Trump while on air. Although Beck's comment was directed at his producer, Stu Burguiere, the FBI is now investigating the matter. Burguiere clarified on Facebook that the threat was not aimed at Trump, but it still placed him in the awkward position of defending his boss for threatening his life.  Further instances of death threats against Trump include the appearance of a Trump tombstone in Central Park. More recently, a group of black teenagers filmed a rap video on YouTube, in which they threatened to kill Trump using AK-47s. The video, titled the "F*ck Trump Anthem," shows the teens parading down the street with baseball bats and shovels. It is evident that these youths have been influenced by mainstream gangster rap artists, such as Rick Ross, who have also called for Trump's murder.  Media analyst Mark Dice has shared clips from the disturbing video, decoding the slang used by the rappers. The song in question is performed by DooleyFunny, Tlow, and Lor Roger CIT4DT. It is perplexing why they chose to post such content on YouTube, perhaps thinking it was entertaining. However, the FBI does not find it amusing, and the group is now under investigation.

  "Coup Represents Turkey's Last Chance to Preserve Democracy, Says Col. Ralph Peters"  In the midst of the ongoing turmoil in Turkey, Col. Ralph Peters sheds light on the uncertain situation, asserting that it will not be until tomorrow morning, at the earliest, that we will know who is prevailing in the current attempt to remove Turkish leadership. Peters contends that the coup represents Turkey's final opportunity to avert the transformation into an authoritarian Islamic regime, if not an outright Islamist dictatorship. Surprisingly, he maintains that the individuals orchestrating this coup are, in fact, the proponents of constitutional democracy, casting a paradoxical hue on the situation.   Peters highlights President Erdogan's gradual dismantling of the secular government, as he gradually replaces and fills various governmental and military positions with Islamists, ultimately constructing an Islamic state. Regarding Erdogan, Peters asserts that he is not a friend of the United States nor a friend of Turkey. Peters warns that if the coup fails, a severe crackdown will ensue, providing the perfect pretext for the eradication of the last remnants of secularism. He emphasizes, "This is not an ordinary military coup attempting to seize power for the sake of power. They are striving to salvage their nation."  Furthermore, Peters points out the misguided stance of President Obama in relation to Islamic matters. The Colonel argues that Obama's assertion of supporting the democratically elected government is flawed, as Erdogan's government does not conform to the democratic principles we uphold. Peters contends that opposition political parties have been banned, opposition politicians have been silenced, and elections have been manipulated to favor Erdogan. In Peters' view, Obama's position aligns him once again with the wrong side when it comes to Islamic affairs.   Peters also draws attention to Erdogan's affiliations with the Muslim Brotherhood, asserting that Obama mistakenly views them as a moderating force in the Middle East. Peters acknowledges that while they may not be as extremist as ISIS, they are still fundamentalists and bring unwelcome news. Peters believes that Obama should have refrained from commenting on the situation in Turkey, underscoring the fact that the individuals behind the coup are on the same side as the United States in their battle against Islamic extremists. However, Peters concludes that this alignment is precisely why Obama could not remain silent, as he deems the President an ally of extreme Islam, acting as their agent within the White House.”X¬  MASS SHOOTING UNLEASHES CHAOS IN NEW ORLEANS  NEW ORLEANS - In a shocking turn of events, chaos erupted today as a mass shooting unfolded in the vibrant city of New Orleans. Preliminary reports suggest that at least 16 individuals have been tragically affected, while two gunmen are said to have been involved. The situation remains fluid, and updates continue to pour in.  According to local sources, the incident occurred on Sunday (Nov. 22) during a lively party that followed a second line parade at Bunny Friend park, nestled in the 9th Ward. Authorities were alerted shortly after 6 p.m., when gunfire erupted and numerous innocent bystanders were struck. As dusk settled, the scene transformed into one of pandemonium, with numerous individuals sprawled across the park's central building. Personal belongings and hats littered the playground, serving as somber reminders of the turmoil that had unfolded mere moments ago.  To address the devastating aftermath, a fleet of ambulances promptly descended upon the park. In a bid to preserve public safety, local law enforcement swiftly cordoned off the area, establishing roadblocks at all entrances leading to the park.  As this tragedy continues to unfold, our hearts go out to the victims and their families, who now grapple with the immense pain and loss. The community remains on edge as the investigation progresses, desperately seeking answers in the wake of this senseless act of violence.”X¤  Denver Teens Suspected of Trying to Join ISIS, FBI Says  Three teenage girls from Denver are suspected of attempting to join ISIS in Syria after allegedly stealing money from their parents and flying to Germany, where they were apprehended by the FBI, according to authorities. The girls, two sisters aged 17 and 15, and their 16-year-old mutual friend, were reported missing when they failed to attend school. The families had no idea where they might have gone, said Glenn Thompson, bureau chief of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Department. However, FBI agents were able to apprehend the girls at Frankfurt Airport over the weekend. A U.S. official has revealed that the teens were en route to Turkey with the ultimate goal of reaching Syria to join ISIS. Investigators are currently reviewing evidence, including the girls' computers. Authorities have not disclosed how the teens became interested in fighting alongside ISIS and have chosen to withhold further details about the case. U.S. officials are conducting a thorough investigation into these claims. This incident is just one example of young Americans attempting to join ISIS, a concerning trend that has attracted significant attention and worry. Critics argue that political correctness is to blame, claiming that certain churches and societal norms discourage open dialogue about radical Islam and fail to confront the issue head-on. The investigation into this case is ongoing.”X1
  In a recent revelation, an alarming agenda has come to light, indicating a purported plan by the United Nations to infiltrate the United States with Muslim refugees. The shocking disclosure was made via the platform Hasalmun.org, shedding light on a clandestine mission that has sent shockwaves across the nation.  The information, if proven accurate, suggests a covert operation undertaken by the United Nations to resettle Muslim refugees in America. This alarming revelation has sparked concerns among citizens, who fear a potential dilution of their cultural fabric and a threat to national security.  Hasalmun.org, an online platform known for its investigative journalism, has brought this matter to the forefront. Although the authenticity of the disclosed agenda is yet to be independently verified, the implications are profoundly significant and warrant thorough scrutiny.  If substantiated, this clandestine plan raises questions about the transparency and accountability of the United Nations. As an organization entrusted with promoting peace and international cooperation, its alleged involvement in such an agenda challenges its credibility and raises concerns about its underlying motives.  Moreover, the potential implications of an influx of Muslim refugees have ignited a heated debate across the country. Advocates argue that America, a nation built on diversity and the values of acceptance, should open its doors to those fleeing conflict and persecution. They emphasize the moral responsibility to provide a safe haven for those in need, regardless of their religious backgrounds.  Opponents, however, express trepidation over the possible cultural and security ramifications of such a move. They fear that the introduction of a significant number of Muslim refugees may create social tensions and compromise national security efforts. These concerns underscore the complexity of the issue and the need for a comprehensive and nuanced approach.  In light of this revelation, it is crucial for policymakers, citizens, and international organizations to engage in a constructive dialogue. A thorough investigation into the alleged United Nations agenda and an open discussion about the potential consequences are imperative to ensure the well-being and security of the nation.  As this story continues to unfold, it serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making in matters of national and international significance. The implications of this alleged agenda are far-reaching and require a measured response from all concerned parties.”Xþ  Dream Coming True for 89-Year-Old Holocaust Survivor  SOUTHFIELD, Mich. â€” It is a story of resilience, hope, and an unwavering dream. Hermina Hirsch, an 89-year-old Holocaust survivor residing in the suburb of Southfield, Michigan, is on the cusp of realizing a long-held aspiration. Freed from the horrors of Auschwitz, Hirsch and her husband, Bernard, relocated to Southfield years ago. It was here that Bernard took her to witness her first Major League Baseball game, a Detroit Tigers spectacle that sparked a profound desire within her.  â€œI donâ€™t want to die before I sing at a baseball game,â€ Hirsch confided in reporters. While her family was aware of her weekly renditions of the National Anthem at Holocaust survivorsâ€™ meetings, they were taken aback by the revelation. Andrea, Hirschâ€™s granddaughter, expressed her astonishment, saying, â€œIt completely shocked my entire family. She used to sing me and my cousins to sleep when we were younger, but we had no idea she wanted to turn her singing into so much more.â€  News of Herminaâ€™s dream swiftly spread on social media, with an outpouring of support on Facebook. Andrea managed to contact representatives from the Detroit Tigers team, who were captivated by the tale. On Wednesday, Hermina Hirsch received the official confirmation: her dream would become a reality. Though the date has yet to be determined, preparations are underway to make this momentous occasion happen.  Will the transition from performing in front of a small group to a stadium filled with thousands unnerve her? According to Hirsch, it will not. â€œI have nothing to lose. Iâ€™m an old woman,â€ she asserted. Bernard, who accompanied her to that inaugural game all those years ago, will be among the many to hear her sing. The National Anthem holds immense significance for this Czechoslovakian woman, and her unwavering love for it and what it represents serves as a poignant lesson for us all.  Hermina Hirschâ€™s journey is a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the power of dreams. As we eagerly await the day she takes center stage at the ballpark, her story serves as a reminder of the resilience that resides within us all.  Source: Vaughan, Vianna.

While Lahren seems unfazed by the backlash, she maintains that she is entitled to her opinions. According to her, BLM is a destructive and dangerous movement.  Lahren supports her claims by presenting video clips of the lawlessness witnessed during the Ferguson protests. These clips depict individuals overturning a police car and a person who appears to be related to Michael Brown encouraging the mob to burn down their own community. Lahren questions how such actions contribute to the pursuit of social justice.  To further illustrate her point, Lahren mentions the riots in Baltimore, which were supposedly sparked by the death of Freddie Gray. She highlights that despite three trials resulting in no convictions, pressure mounted for the district attorney to resign. Lahren also plays audio of protesters chanting "pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon," arguing that this contradicts claims that BLM is not anti-cop.  While acknowledging that the Dallas event initially began peacefully, Lahren suggests that such instances are exceptions rather than the rule. She asserts that BLM activists disrupt events like Donald Trump rallies to label him as racist, just as they do with the police. According to Lahren, these individuals are paid agitators working to create civil unrest and destabilize the United States. She further alleges that they are merely pawns of the anti-American financier George Soros, hiding behind a facade of social justice.  Lahren also addresses the latest actions of BLM, emphasizing the need for an end to this dangerous behavior. In her opinion, these individuals should be incarcerated if they cannot function peacefully in society. Lahren argues that jail is the ideal place for them to learn the necessary skills to coexist, if they are capable of such growth at all.”Xx
  New research conducted by scientists at the City of Hope in Duarte, California, suggests that the popular antidepressant Paxil may contribute to the growth of cancerous tumors in women. The team of scientists has developed a new method to identify drugs and chemicals that disrupt human sex hormones and influence the development and progression of diseases, specifically breast cancer in women. In a trial screening of 446 widely used drugs, the researchers found that Paxil, also known as paroxetine, has a weak estrogenic effect that could promote the development and growth of breast tumors. This finding is significant because up to 25 percent of women undergoing breast cancer treatment suffer from depression, which is often treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Paxil. Additionally, nearly a quarter of women in their 40s and 50s in the United States are taking some form of antidepressant, mostly SSRIs.  The study also revealed that other medications have a similar negative effect on estrogen. Last summer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of a low-dose paroxetine, marketed as Brisdelle, as a non-hormonal treatment for hot flashes and other menopause-related problems. Approximately 70 percent of breast cancers in women are estrogen-sensitive, meaning that the hormone contributes to the growth of cancerous tumors. The screening method developed at the City of Hope also identified two antifungal drugs, biconazole and oxyconazole, as having a negative effect on estrogen similar to medications prescribed to prevent and stop the recurrence of breast cancer in women. Furthermore, bisphenol A, a compound used in the manufacture of plastics and epoxy resins, was found to promote estrogen and increase the risk of breast cancer.  The discovery that Paxil has an endocrine-altering effect may provide valuable insights to cancer researchers, who have long been suspicious of medication in women with breast cancer. A study conducted in Canada in 2010 found that breast cancer patients who were prescribed Paxil were more likely to die of breast cancer compared to those who were given a different antidepressant, particularly when there was a substantial overlap in their use of Paxil and tamoxifen, a drug used to prevent breast cancer recurrence. The results of this study will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Toxicological Sciences.  Overall, this research sheds light on the potential risks associated with the use of Paxil and other medications that have a negative effect on estrogen. With a significant percentage of women using antidepressants and the high prevalence of breast cancer,”Xc
  Alaska Airlines flight attendants have recently filed a formal complaint regarding their uniforms, suspecting that they may be causing skin rashes, lesions, and hair loss. However, new evidence suggests that radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster could also be a potential cause. KING 5 News in Seattle, Wash., was the first to report on this "mystery illness," which has affected at least 280 flight attendants. The affected individuals have reported persistent itching, skin lesions, and hair loss, leading them to believe that the newer flight uniforms, which allegedly contain tributyl phosphate, a toxic organophosphorus compound linked to skin problems, may be to blame.  However, not everyone is convinced that the uniforms are the sole cause. Alexander Higgins has recently connected the symptoms experienced by the flight attendants to those observed in local marine life and polar bear populations, potentially linking the Fukushima Daiichi disaster to the flight attendants' health issues. In April, AlaskaPublic.org reported on numerous polar bears in the Beaufort Sea, located north of Alaska and Canada's Yukon and Northwest Territories, developing skin lesions and experiencing hair loss. Prior to this, ice seals and walruses in the Arctic also exhibited similar symptoms. Scientists and biologists initially attributed these symptoms to viruses, bacteria, and other factors, avoiding the possibility of nuclear radiation as the cause. However, further investigation has disproven these hypotheses, leaving nuclear fallout from Fukushima as a potential explanation for the animals' ailments.  The timing of the flight attendants' symptoms, along with the similarity of their symptoms to those observed in the affected marine life, strongly suggests a link to nuclear radiation. Despite this evidence, it is unlikely that mainstream media, the Association of Flight Attendants, or other prominent groups will openly discuss the possibility of Fukushima radiation as a cause. The severity of Fukushima radiation has been downplayed in the official narrative, as recent reports reveal that it has been far worse than previously disclosed.  In conclusion, the Alaska Airlines flight attendants' complaint about their uniforms potentially causing health issues has raised concerns about a link to radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The timing and correlation of symptoms experienced by marine life and flight attendants further support this connection. However, due to the lack of open discussion surrounding Fukushima radiation, it is unlikely that this potential cause will be thoroughly examined by mainstream sources.”Xó
  In the wake of Hurricane Gustav, which has left over one million residents in Louisiana without electricity, a generous donation has been made to provide emergency light and radios to those in need. A contribution of $20,000 worth of EcoLEDs 8-in-1 Emergency Tools has been given to the WorldCare non-profit organization for distribution to Hurricane Gustav victims. EcoLEDs, a company founded in 2007, aims to provide affordable, environmentally-friendly LED lighting technology to consumers who prioritize sustainability. Through their BetterLifeGoods website, they have successfully supplied power-saving LED lights to homes, museums, and offices worldwide.

  Big Pharma's push to develop medications for both real and imaginary conditions has been fueled by the fields of infectious disease medicine and psychiatry. Only America and New Zealand permit television advertising for the pharmaceutical industry's often questionable inventions targeting fabricated illnesses. From restless leg syndrome to restless kids, these made-up diseases have spurred the creation of chemical concoctions that are frequently dangerous and usually ineffective. Shockingly, even toddlers are now being prescribed Ritalin.  The latest addition to the roster of claimed disorders is sleep drunkenness, a condition that describes a state of confusion upon awakening. However, it has nothing to do with being intoxicated while falling asleep. The urgency to find a pill to treat this newly labeled disorder is concerning, especially considering the potential dangers associated with existing pharmaceutical remedies for sleeplessness or insomnia. Ambien, the leading prescribed sleeping pill on the market, has been known to cause sleepwalking, sleep driving, and even sleep cooking and eating, with users often engaging in bizarre and sometimes harmful activities without any recollection.  As if this weren't enough, Big Pharma has now conducted a study on sleep drunkenness. Researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto, California found that one in seven Americans experience intense confusion upon awakening. However, 84 percent of these individuals also had other sleep disorders, mental health issues, or were taking psychotropic drugs like antidepressants. It appears that the majority of those who experience episodes of "confusional arousal" also have underlying conditions or are on psychiatric medications or sleeping pills.  In essence, most cases of "confusional arousal" are likely caused by medical treatments. While the confusion is typically not severe, there have been instances of tragic outcomes, such as a man who walked off a ship and drowned shortly after being awakened. More commonly, individuals may accidentally strike their bed partners when awakening in a disoriented state. During these episodes, individuals momentarily lose their sense of location.  For those who do not suffer from known sleep disorders or use psychiatric medications, "confusional arousal" episodes can occur when napping while experiencing jet lag or when sleep is either inadequate or excessive. The researchers concluded that insufficient sleep is typically less than six hours, while excessive sleep is over nine hours. Additionally, interrupted sleep can also lead to a state of confusion upon awakening. Other factors, such as waking from a fever-induced nightmare or emerging from sleep after consuming alcohol the previous night, can also contribute to a foggy and disoriented state.  In conclusion, the prevalence of "confusional arousal" is closely tied to underlying”X  Water fluoridation may be linked to hypothyroidism at levels lower than those allowed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to a study conducted by researchers from the University of Kent and published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism and other bodily functions, and an underactive thyroid can lead to weight gain and depression. Lead author Stephen Peckham stated, "Underactive thyroid is a particularly nasty thing to have and it can lead to other long-term health problems. I do think councils need to think again about putting fluoride in the water. There are far safer ways to improve dental health." The researchers reviewed medical records from 98 percent of England's general practitioners and compared rates of hypothyroidism with the fluoride content of water in each region. They found that rates of hypothyroidism were 30 percent higher in areas with fluoride content between 0.3 ppm and 0.7 ppm, and 62 percent higher in areas with fluoride content above 0.7 ppm, compared to areas with levels below 0.3 ppm. The researchers also compared hypothyroidism rates between two metropolitan areas, one with water fluoridation and one without, and found that rates were 94 percent higher in the area with fluoridation. The study suggests that in England alone, 15,000 people may be suffering from hypothyroidism due to water fluoridation. The researchers called for a reevaluation of public health policy regarding water fluoridation.”XÃ
  Study Challenges Government's Claims on Biofuels' Environmental Impact  A recent study conducted by researchers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has raised questions about the environmental benefits of biofuels made from leftover materials of harvested corn. The study suggests that these biofuels may actually be worse than gasoline in terms of harmful atmospheric emissions in the short term, contrary to the government's assertions that they are a cleaner alternative to combat climate change.  The research, which was funded by the federal government and published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Climate Change, found that biofuels made with corn residue release 7 percent more greenhouse gases in the early years compared to conventional gasoline. While biofuels may have long-term benefits, they do not meet the standard set in a 2007 energy law to qualify as renewable fuel.  The study focused on the use of corn cobs and stover to manufacture cellulose biofuels. The researchers discovered that burning these leftover materials at biorefineries across the country actually increases emissions from the plant matter and other residue components, instead of allowing them to remain in the soil as organic matter. According to Adam Liska, the lead author of the paper and assistant professor of biological systems engineering at the University of Nebraska, if the residue had not been removed, it could have naturally added to the soil's carbon content.  Using a computer model, the researchers estimated emissions across the nation's Corn Belt, which encompasses approximately 128 million acres. They found that removing about 2.68 metric tons of residue per acre per year over five to 10 years could decrease soil organic carbon by approximately 200 pounds per acre per year. This decrease results in an average increase of 50 to 70 grams of CO2 per megajoule of biofuel, making these biofuels emit about 7 percent more carbon dioxide than gasoline.  The study also highlighted that Wisconsin and Minnesota experience higher carbon losses compared to other states. The researchers believe that the cold weather in these states slows down the release of soil organic carbon into the atmosphere. Additionally, higher corn yields in these states contribute larger amounts of carbon to the soil, resulting in a greater loss when corn residue is collected.  The findings of this study have significant implications for cellulosic biofuels, which have received over $1 billion in federal subsidies and support but have struggled to meet volume targets mandated by law. Approximately 50 percent of the initial market in cellulosics is estimated to be derived from corn residue. The biofuel industry and the Obama administration have criticized”Xó  Scientists argue that killing newborn babies should be allowed in society, claiming that it is ethically no different from abortion, according to a recently published article in the Journal of Medical Ethics. The paper asserts that newborn babies are not considered "actual persons" and do not possess a "moral right to life." The authors of the article, Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva, are esteemed ethicists in mainstream medicine, with one of them being a former Oxford scholar. They contend that the moral status of an infant is equivalent to that of a fetus in terms of lacking the properties that justify the attribution of a right to life.   Sadly, these scientists have faced numerous death threats, although it is difficult to label them as such since individuals who deny the existence of life in newborns cannot be considered living themselves. While using sarcasm, some argue that the authors' own reasoning suggests their lack of consciousness, comparing them to mindless zombies. Giubilini and Minerva refer to the killing of infants as "after-birth abortion," asserting that it should be permitted in the same cases as regular abortion.   The admission of this mass murder agenda by abortion advocates is indeed a stark revelation. Rather than hiding behind false explanations, these scientists present an unfiltered and callous attack on human life in a supposedly "scientific" paper, raising questions about the extent of madness within the medical scientific community. If human babies hold no value, then it follows that young trees, newborn wild animals, or seed sprouts may also lack worth. To the conventional medical industry, life appears to be a resource to be exploited for power and profit. This ethical context mirrors the push for GMOs, chemotherapy, and even vaccines. In fact, the argument made by these medical ethicists, that babies may be killed due to the burden they pose on society, aligns with the logic of vaccine proponents who argue that sacrificing a few children during mass vaccination campaigns reduces the strain on healthcare systems. However, this claim is untrue, as vaccines do not actually decrease the spread of infectious diseases, as thoroughly explained in Jon Rappoport's comprehensive course, "Vaccines: Armed and Dangerous."”Xä
  Botox, the controversial anti-aging drug, has recently gained approval from both the US Food and Drug Administration and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for the treatment of migraines. A study published in the journal Cephalalgia found that those who received botox treatment experienced a 10% reduction in the number of headache days compared to those in the placebo group. However, experts remain skeptical about the effectiveness of this procedure.  Jen Olesen, Chief of the Danish Headache Centre at Glostrup University Hospital, criticized the study's findings and pointed out flaws in the trial. Olesen expressed his concerns in an editorial for the journal Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin, arguing that the FDA made a mistake in approving botox as a migraine treatment. He highlighted that half of the trial participants were overusing pain medications, making it difficult to determine whether their migraines were chronic or caused by medication overuse. Additionally, the visible changes in facial expressions caused by botox treatments compromised the double-blind nature of the experiment.  The use of botox for migraines originated from observations made by plastic surgeons in Hollywood who noticed that their patients experienced some relief from migraines after receiving botox treatments for anti-aging purposes. This off-label treatment gained popularity among other practitioners, leading the pharmaceutical company that developed botox to market it as a migraine remedy. However, the company was fined $375 million for unlawful marketing since there was no scientific evidence at the time to support its effectiveness in treating migraines.  Despite the controversy, several studies have emerged supporting botox as a potential treatment for migraines. A recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reviewed previous studies on botox injections for migraines and found a small to modest benefit for patients suffering from chronic migraine headaches and chronic daily headaches.  It is important to distinguish between headaches and migraines. Tension-type headaches are more common, with at least 42% of adults experiencing them at some point in their lives. Most people do not seek professional help for these headaches and instead rely on over-the-counter pain relievers. Migraines, on the other hand, affect a smaller percentage of the population (8-18%) and are associated with greater disability. Migraines are typically felt on one side of the head, while headaches are felt on both sides.  In conclusion, while botox has gained approval for the treatment of migraines, experts remain skeptical about its efficacy. Further research is needed to determine its true effectiveness in alleviating migraine symptoms.”X–	  Millions of individuals struggle with bad skin on a daily basis, but the good news is that this condition is largely preventable. Whether it's adolescent breakouts or adult acne, most cases of "bad skin" can be attributed to poor choices. Recent scientific discoveries have shed light on potential triggers for these conditions, leading many people to reevaluate their habits. Factors such as diet, gut function, and body product selection have all been identified as potential contributors to skin problems.  The connection between diet and skin is one of the most significant factors in dealing with skin issues. Grains, sugar, and processed foods have been repeatedly linked to acne and other conditions like eczema. It is now widely accepted that one's diet directly impacts the quality of their skin. By cutting out sugars, refined grains (gluten), and processed, preserved foods, individuals can achieve significant success in combating bad skin. The scientific evidence supporting this approach is undeniable. Of all the foods that can contribute to skin problems, sugar is perhaps the worst offender. Sugar leads to elevated insulin levels, which can in turn promote the production of acne-causing bacteria. This connection between sugar and acne is an often overlooked area of dermatology within the medical community.  In the world of beauty products, consumers have become increasingly susceptible to scams. It is important to recognize that chemically dense cosmetics do not actually promote beauty or healthy skin, despite their claims. From lotions to various types of makeup, many of these products are toxic and can cause serious skin and health problems. The key is to choose high-quality products with natural ingredients. For example, using coconut oil as a daily lotion is a great alternative to chemical-laden options. Opting for pure, natural skin products will lead to healthier skin.  The Western way of living is filled with toxins, and conditions like acne primarily affect those in modernized societies. By adopting a more natural and organic lifestyle, including choosing organic foods and body products, individuals can effectively address these conditions. It is logical that the body exhibits signs of disease when constantly exposed to harmful substances. Acne is just one of the many indicators that the body is not at ease with itself. For more information on preventing acne, please refer to the resource section below.”X®
  Chinese Vaccine Scandal Raises Concerns Over Health and Safety  In a shocking revelation, a massive illegal vaccine operation has been uncovered in Shangdong province, igniting anger among parents in China. The operation, which involved hundreds of people and had spread to 24 provinces and cities, has raised serious concerns about the safety of vaccines in the country.  The outrage intensified after news broke that a boy who had been vaccinated died, although Chinese officials have denied any link between the death and the Shangdong scandal. However, this claim has been met with skepticism by many, as it seems implausible that the two incidents are unrelated.  The illegal vaccine ring, which is just one of many health and safety scandals to plague China in recent years, is believed to have been operating since 2011, according to officials. Reports indicate that the ringleaders, a mother and daughter, purchased vaccines from both licensed and unlicensed sources before selling them to illegal agents or local disease control and prevention centers at inflated prices.  Further investigations have revealed that the vaccines, worth $88 million, were not stored or transported in the appropriate conditions approved by the state. This has raised concerns about the potential compromise of the vaccines, which could lead to further deaths and disabilities.  Chinese authorities have been aware of the illegal ring for a year, but only recently made the information public, sparking outrage among the public. Many have taken to social media to express their anger and frustration, questioning why it took the government so long to acknowledge the scandal.  In response to the public outcry, authorities have promised to hold those responsible accountable. However, this gesture is unlikely to quell the anger and distrust that has been ignited by the scandal.  The affected vaccines include those for polio, rabies, mumps, encephalitis, hepatitis B, and meningococcal diseases. Tragically, a four-year-old boy who received meningococcal and polio vaccines was among the victims who lost their lives.  This scandal in China highlights the importance of proper regulation and oversight in the vaccine industry. It serves as a reminder that the safety and wellbeing of citizens should always be the top priority.  Meanwhile, in the United States, concerns over vaccine safety have also been raised. Reports from September 2013 revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deleted a fact page on their website linking cancer with a virus found in polio vaccines. This revelation has raised alarm among many, as it is estimated that over 98 million Americans may be infected with this cancer-promoting virus.  Both”X  New Dutch research suggests that low levels of man-made chemicals in common foods such as bread, milk, and butter could accumulate in the human body and pose a threat to health, according to a study cited by the World Wildlife Fund-UK. The study found that chemicals from the environment or food packaging can be present in foods in low levels. Some scientists believe that even low levels of these chemicals can build up in the body over time and cause health problems. The Dutch scientists discovered low levels of flame retardants, pesticides, artificial fragrances, non-stick chemicals, and phthalate chemicals from plastics in foods. Research conducted at the London School of Pharmacy suggests that even low doses of these chemicals can combine to produce serious medical conditions. Mike Adams, a natural health advocate and author of 'Grocery Warning,' warns that certain chemicals used in food packaging have already started causing problems for humans and the environment. For instance, fish in the Potomac River have been found with both male and female sex organs, and human girls are now showing signs of puberty as young as three years old. Adams attributes the increase in hormone-related cancers to chemicals, particularly those from plastics, that mimic hormones in animals and humans. Health authorities in the UK have advised consumers and manufacturers to be cautious about chemicals in their foods, but further research is needed to understand how these substances interact with one another and the potential consequences of those interactions.”X©  Vaginal yeast infections are often indicative of a broader issue known as systemic yeast, a condition that requires immediate attention to address Candida overgrowth. Upon discovering a natural remedy that proves effective but subsequently experiences a recurrence of symptoms, it becomes imperative to tackle the problem at its root. Fortunately, numerous treatment options exist to combat vaginal yeast infections, albeit with varying degrees of convenience and comfort. Among these alternatives, some may prove messy, while others offer soothing relief, and a few may even elicit discomfort. Notably, natural cures encompass a range of possibilities to explore in this endeavor.”X&  Eli Lilly Accused of Manipulating Drug Trial Results, Withholding Evidence of Suicide Risks  In a recent tweet, Harvard psychiatrist Martin Teicher lambasted pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly for treating the American public as "guinea pigs." Teicher contends that the company engaged in widespread scientific fraud by selectively choosing individuals for drug trial results, effectively cherry-picking data to suit their needs. Specifically, if any participant in the trial displayed suicidal behavior, they were conveniently excused and omitted from the outcome data.  While this revelation may not come as a surprise to readers of this publication, it is worth noting that accusations about the suicide risks associated with antidepressant drugs were first made public in 1999 â€“ a time when such claims were dismissed as mere conspiracy theories. However, these allegations are now gaining traction as scientific fact. The alarming number of murder-suicides connected to Prozac and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) would surely shock the public if they knew the full extent of the tragedy. Take, for instance, the case of comedian Phil Hartman, who was killed by his wife while she was under the influence of these drugs. Additionally, the infamous Columbine massacre involved two teenage boys who were also on antidepressants.  What remains most perplexing about these revelations is how pharmaceutical companies manage to conceal such damning evidence and suppress negative findings for such extended periods. Astonishingly, the missing Prozac documents referenced in this case date back to a trial in 1994 â€“ a decade-long cover-up during which billions of dollars' worth of these drugs were peddled to patients by doctors acting as drug pushers. Naturally, Eli Lilly denies any wrongdoing, asserting that their drugs are entirely safe and that they have no ulterior motives, only a commitment to the betterment of humanity â€“ or so they claim. One can only imagine how the parents of the Columbine victims must feel in light of these disturbing revelations.”X>
  Parents who choose not to vaccinate their children often face criticism for potentially endangering their own children and others. However, both legally and medically, unvaccinated children do not pose a significant health risk to themselves or the community. This argument is not only supported by alternative vaccine views but also aligns with mainstream vaccine beliefs, accepted medical practice, and current law.  From a legal standpoint, forty-eight state legislatures, federal agencies, and all U.S. territories provide religious exemptions to immunizations. The fact that these exemptions were enacted demonstrates that the potential health risks associated with exercising them were carefully considered. This legal presumption is not a mere technicality but is based on the well-established concept of herd immunity. According to this theory, as long as a majority of the population is immune, all members of the population are protected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that no vaccine is 100% effective, with routine childhood vaccines typically being effective for 85% to 95% of recipients. Additionally, the CDC attributes the majority of outbreaks to individuals who did not develop immunity after vaccination. In contrast, national exemption rates are only around 1% to 2.5% on average. These figures indicate that 100% immunity is not necessary for overall protection.  It is also important to note that exemption status alone does not determine an individual child's immunity. Many exempt children develop natural immunity without ever getting sick, as confirmed by the CDC. The focus should be on the collective vaccination status of a population rather than the vaccination status of individual children. Furthermore, laws and procedures have been implemented to account for non-immune children, regardless of their vaccination status. For instance, during an outbreak, most states require exempt children to stay home from school for the duration of the incubation period of the disease. However, it is worth mentioning that this practice seems to discriminate against exempt children, as their non-immune, vaccinated peers should be considered a greater threat due to their larger numbers. Nonetheless, non-immune, vaccinated children are not subject to the same requirements, possibly due to the challenges of identifying them.  In conclusion, the belief that unvaccinated children pose a significant health risk is not supported by the legal, medical, and scientific evidence. The existence of religious exemptions in numerous states and federal agencies indicates that potential risks have been taken into account. The concept of herd immunity, which forms the basis of current vaccine policies, supports the idea that overall population immunity is more important than individual vaccination status. Additionally, laws”XÙ
  Global corporations are once again under scrutiny for their use of questionable scientific claims to promote their products. The latest example involves Coca-Cola, which has been found to have paid "fitness and nutrition experts" to publish articles on over 1,000 news websites, including major newspapers, in an effort to position its products as a "healthy snack." This move has drawn criticism from numerous scientists, doctors, and journalists who argue that promoting a beverage filled with high fructose corn syrup, phosphoric acid, and chemical flavorings as healthy is misleading.  The issue at hand is not new. Corporations have a long history of funding individuals to spread their propaganda, and this case is no exception. By paying off these "experts," Coca-Cola is attempting to present its products as scientifically supported and beneficial. According to the company, this effort is simply aimed at providing "context to the latest facts and science around our products and ingredients." However, many argue that this is nothing more than a ploy to deceive consumers.  The Associated Press has shed light on the ethical violations inherent in this type of "payola journalism." Writer Candice Choi has exposed the blatant conflict of interest in accepting money to promote a product that contributes to serious chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and kidney stones. By doing so, these writers are not only compromising their professional integrity but also contributing to the suffering caused by these diseases.  One such example is a registered dietician who wrote an article for a Chicago bilingual newspaper titled "Ideas to Score a Touchdown during the Super Bowl without Sacrificing the Diet." In this piece, the writer suggests that Hispanics, who already face high rates of type-2 diabetes, should "drink a mini Coke can with mini sliders." It is worth noting that this dietician is a paid propagandist who also works on corporate communications for Kellogg's and other companies. Another example can be found on Patch.com, where an article promising "Heart Health Month Snacking & Exercise Tips" actually recommends a mini can of Coca-Cola as a "refreshing beverage option." The author of this piece is described as a "Personal Trainer and Sports Nutritionist who helps individuals, businesses including The Coca-Cola Company and organizations develop a culture of wellness." This juxtaposition of Coca-Cola with the concept of wellness has rightfully raised eyebrows.  While promoting truly healthy solutions is acceptable and even commendable, accepting money to endorse a product that contributes to disease is not. It is imperative that consumers remain vigilant in questioning the claims made by global corporations and the individuals they”Xÿ
  Breakthrough in Cancer Research: Chinese Herb Shows Promise as Potential Cure  A groundbreaking discovery has emerged in the field of cancer research, offering hope for a possible cure. Researchers from the United States have found that an extract from a popular Chinese herb called "thunder god vine" may hold the key to regulating a protein involved in cancer cell death, specifically targeting pancreatic cancer cells. The study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology, sheds light on a potential game-changer in the treatment of one of the deadliest forms of cancer.  Pancreatic cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, has long been considered a death sentence within the realm of conventional treatments. According to data, less than 5% of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive more than five years after undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation, making it an aggressive and lethal form of cancer. However, researchers from the University of Minnesota have made an astounding discovery that could revolutionize cancer treatment.  With funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the research team at the University of Minnesota focused their attention on the Chinese herb Tirpterygium wilforii, commonly known as "thunder god vine." Their experiments involved administering an extract called triptolide onto human pancreatic cancer cells and tissue in a controlled environment. The results were remarkable, as the extract effectively decreased the expression of a protein known as GRP78, which protects cells from death, including pancreatic cancer cells.  GRP78, a protein responsible for producing and facilitating the correct folding of proteins, plays a crucial role in maintaining proper cell function. It also aids in the transfer of proteins and carbohydrates within cells. However, when this protein production and transfer process is disrupted, GRP78 activates a cellular response that protects healthy cells from damage, known as the "unfolded protein response" (UPR). Unfortunately, this response can inadvertently protect cancer cells and promote their survival and spread throughout the body.  The introduction of triptolide appears to disrupt this protective mechanism of GRP78, potentially inducing a cancer-protective effect. "GRP78, a protein that protects cells from dying, is more abundant in cancer cells and tissue than in normal organs and is thought to play a role in helping pancreatic cancer cells survive and thrive," states the American Physiological Society (APS), the organization that published the study.  By calibrating the function of UPR, triptolide helps trigger cell death specifically in cancerous cells, while preserving healthy cells. This discovery holds significant promise”•h     X‹
  While type 1 diabetes may not be as prevalent as type 2 diabetes, its impact can be just as devastating. Unlike type 2 diabetes, which is often caused by controllable factors such as weight gain and poor nutrition, type 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disorder that individuals are born with. In this condition, the beta cells in the pancreas are unable to produce the necessary insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Consequently, blood sugar levels can rapidly become dangerously high or low. Traditionally, type 1 diabetes has been managed through a combination of insulin injections or an insulin pump, along with careful monitoring of carbohydrate intake based on activity levels. However, this can be an arduous way of life, particularly for children. Fortunately, there are natural substances that show potential in treating this condition.  One such substance is arginine, an amino acid that can be found in most health food stores as a nutritional supplement. A study conducted in 2007 discovered that regular use of arginine in laboratory animals stimulated the production of beta cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for insulin production. Another natural remedy is goldenseal, an herb with a long history of medicinal use. Scientists believe that goldenseal's effectiveness in treating diabetes lies in its berberine content, a bioactive compound that has been shown in animal studies to stimulate the production of beta cells.  Stevia, a naturally sweet plant that has gained popularity as a sugar substitute, is also beneficial for diabetics for reasons beyond its low carbohydrate content. Stevia contains compounds that have been found to rejuvenate damaged pancreatic beta cells, providing similar actions to the anti-diabetic drug glibenclamide but without any unwanted side effects. Red clover, traditionally known for its hormone-balancing properties in women, also aids type 1 diabetics due to its active compound genistein. Genistein has been proven to stimulate the proliferation of beta cells in the pancreas.  Fig leaves, while their specific anti-diabetic compounds have not yet been isolated, have shown promise in reducing the insulin requirements of diabetics. Individuals who take supplements derived from fig leaves require less insulin than those who do not. These natural substances offer hope for a treatment for type 1 diabetes that does not rely on synthetic insulin, whether through injections or a pump. For young type 1 diabetics, these natural treatments could make a significant difference, potentially allowing them to experience a more normal childhood, an opportunity that can be challenging to achieve with current mainstream treatments.”Xà
  As the November elections approach and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, continues to have negative impacts on American families, President Obama is making efforts to delay the most controversial aspects of the law. However, an increasing number of people are speaking out against it, not necessarily for political reasons, but due to the disastrous effects it has had on their lives. In response, the administration has launched a propaganda campaign against many of the most vocal critics, drawing comparisons to the authoritarianism of Stalin or the propaganda tactics of Hitler's Joseph Goebbels.  One group that has been particularly affected by the requirements and mandates of Obamacare is cancer victims, who have experienced disruptions in their treatment and care. Michigan is a crucial state in the upcoming U.S. Senate elections, and Republicans have a good chance of gaining the open seat of retiring Democrat Carl Levin, given Democratic nominee Gary Peters's unpopular vote in favor of the Affordable Care Act. However, Peters may have hope due to the president's unilateral delays in Obamacare mandates, which have eased planned layoffs by local governments and businesses. Additionally, the state's moderate GOP governor, Rick Snyder, supports the Medicaid expansion under the ACA, and the liberal news media in the state have largely ignored the estimated 225,000-plus canceled individual policies and job losses at medical-device maker Stryker.  Despite these factors, one individual, Julie Boonstra, will not be ignored. Boonstra, a leukemia victim from Dexter, Michigan, lost her coverage last fall because her plan did not comply with the minimum coverage requirements of Obamacare. Her insurance company, like many others, had no choice but to drop her in order to comply with the law. However, Boonstra chose to fight back. She shared her story in a powerful advertisement, criticizing Obamacare and Representative Gary Peters for his support of the law. Boonstra's efforts have made her a target for Democrats who voted for the Affordable Care Act and their allies in the media. They have attempted to tarnish her reputation and label her as a liar and an idiot because she refused to accept her new government-approved Obamacare plan.  This pattern of intimidation is not unique to Boonstra. Other outspoken female cancer victims from different states have faced similar tactics in an effort to silence them or prevent them from coming forward. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been particularly callous in this regard, claiming on the Senate floor that all of the horror stories surrounding Obamacare are untrue. It is important to note that this article does not endorse chemical cancer treatment; it simply highlights the denial of an”Xð  Corn, or maize as it is also known, has been consumed for thousands of years in the lowlands of what is now southwestern Mexico. The process of domestication, which involves a combination of random mutations and selective breeding by humans, has shaped this important crop. Selective breeding occurs when humans encourage the reproduction of plant or animal varieties that possess desirable traits. The length of time it took for humans to domesticate crops like wheat and corn is a topic of intense scientific debate. While evidence suggests that domestic wheat was being consumed 9,000 years ago in what is now southeastern Turkey, archaeological findings indicate that humans may have been consuming the wild ancestor of wheat 14,000 years prior to that. The extent to which selective breeding played a role in this process remains uncertain. Selective breeding is a natural method of shaping agricultural crops, while genetic engineering, which involves the creation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), is considered an unnatural approach that poses a threat to the future of food crops.

  In this week's edition of Mental Health Exposed, we are honored to have Dr. Eric Pearl, the esteemed developer of Reconnective Healing and author of The Reconnection and his latest work, Solomon Speaks. While I am not a follower of Reconnection, I must acknowledge the significant contributions Dr. Pearl has made to the spiritual and energy healing realm since his introduction. Reconnective Healing offers a revolutionary, non-contact approach to energy healing. Through training and reconnection, individuals gain access to the spiritual energy present in the universe, enabling them to heal others from various ailments. This incredible journey began after Dr. Pearl was contacted by spiritual entities, channeled through unsuspecting patients in his chiropractic office in Los Angeles.   When Dr. Pearl expressed interest in being a guest on Mental Health Exposed, I was eager to challenge him, as I identify as a skeptic rather than a supporter. I questioned his methods, suggesting that his students may be victims of mass hypnosis. Furthermore, I disagreed with his emphasis on channeling, a central theme in his latest book, Solomon Speaks. However, Dr. Pearl was well-prepared for our discussion. I was informed that he possesses an impressive intellect, extensive knowledge in healing, communication skills, and spirituality. Additionally, his charisma places him in an exclusive category of individuals capable of creating new paradigms and attracting a substantial following. As an outsider observing such phenomena, one cannot help but ponder the true nature of these events. Are they genuine? Or are they merely an audacious fabrication?  Dr. Pearl's narrative evokes parallels with Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Church. Smith's claims of encountering God, angels, and golden plates were so extraordinary that some individuals believed him simply because "no one could make all that up." I find myself drawing similar conclusions regarding Dr. Pearl. If his story is fabricated - and one must listen to it to grasp its complexity - it rivals that of Joseph Smith. In that case, Dr. Pearl would either be a sociopathic liar, a despicable charlatan, or mentally unstable. However, if Dr. Pearl is indeed telling the truth, then Reconnective Healing is a phenomenon that demands our attention, as it is transforming the world and revolutionizing the healing process. We are at the precipice of a new era, one defined by spirituality and energy, and it appears that Dr. Pearl is at the forefront of this movement. When asked about his extraordinary experiences, Dr. Pearl humbly responds, "”X
  Health Canada held on to a report for over a year that established a "strong relationship" between lung cancer and chrysotile asbestos mined in Canada, according to a panel of international experts. The report, received by Health Canada in March 2008, was authored by Trevor Ogden, the panel chairman. Ogden repeatedly requested that Health Canada make the report public, but the requests were met with resistance. Ogden referred to the delay as "an annoying piece of needless government secrecy." After 10 months of processing, the Canadian media outlet Canwest News Service obtained the report under Access to Information legislation.   The report concluded that there is a less certain connection between chrysotile asbestos and mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer. However, Ogden stated in an introductory letter that the report did find a strong connection between chrysotile asbestos and lung cancer. Ogden, who is the editor-in-chief of The Annals of Occupational Hygiene in Britain, also noted in the letter that the panel included members with opposing views on the subject, including industry consultant David Bernstein, who had previous involvement with asbestos producer Union Carbide Corp, as well as Canadian and California asbestos mining companies.   Health Canada justified the delay in releasing the report by stating that it needed time to carefully review the findings and consult with other federal and provincial partners. Leslie Stayner, director of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Illinois School of Public Health, commented on the report, which also identified amphibole asbestos as having a connection to the risk of mesothelioma. Stayner emphasized that the report did not say that exposure to chrysotile asbestos is safe. He stated, "The most important thing is what it doesn't say, which is some people have alleged it would say. What it doesn't say is that exposure to chrysotile asbestos is safe." Stayner added, "I think the bottom line here is that all forms of asbestos cause both mesothelioma and lung cancer. We will probably for many years still be debating this question of relative hazard of chrysotile. The fundamental question of whether it's hazardous or not is clear. I think the answer to that is, yes, chrysotile is a hazardous substance."   The release of the report has reignited the debate on the future of the asbestos industry in Canada, particularly in Quebec where the industry is concentrated. Member of Parliament Pat Martin, a long-time advocate for a ban on Canada's asbestos industry, emphasized”XR	  Yokohama Tire, the North American arm of Yokohama Rubber Co. Ltd., has unveiled a groundbreaking tire that revolutionizes the use of petroleum by incorporating oil derived from orange peels. The environmentally conscious dB Super E-spec tire replaces a significant portion of petroleum with sustainable orange oil and natural rubber, without compromising performance. Dan King, the vice president of sales at Yokohama Tire, emphasized that the tire not only reduces petroleum use but also enhances fuel efficiency with a remarkable 20-percent reduction in rolling resistance, which ultimately saves consumers money at the gas pump.  Dubbed Super E-spec, the tire is crafted from vulcanized rubber, much like its conventional counterparts. However, the Super E-spec sets itself apart by replacing 80 percent of petroleum with orange oil. This oil is sourced from a "no-emission factory" operated by Yokohama, which conveniently acquires orange peels from a neighboring orange juice factory. The company has successfully integrated the Super E-spec into its line of racing tires and has exclusively adopted it for the Porsche GT3 Cup race, known as the Patron GT3 Challenge. Notably, the tire has proven its capabilities in both short and 24-hour races, affirming its exceptional performance.  Mark Chung, the director of corporate strategy and planning at Yokohama Tire, credited the company's racing engineers for conceiving the concept of combining orange peel oil with natural rubber. By extensively testing and pushing the tire's limits in racing environments, the technology has matured to the point where Yokohama is now introducing it to their passenger car lineup.  Initially, the Super E-spec will be available in 15- and 16-inch diameters, catering to hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius, Toyota Camry Hybrid, Honda Civic Hybrid, and Honda Accord Hybrid. Additionally, it will be compatible with some non-hybrid models such as the Nissan Versa, Volkswagen Golf, and the natural gas-powered GX. Yokohama Tire plans to extend its tire sizes to accommodate a wider range of vehicles, including cars and sport-utility vehicles.  While Yokohama Tire has not released specific details about the ecological impact of disposing of the Super E-spec compared to other tires, the introduction of this innovative product marks a significant step towards a more sustainable tire industry.”X`
  Title: FDA's Campaigns Against Natural Healers and Supplement Companies: An Unveiled History  In a series of aggressive crackdowns, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched campaigns targeting natural healers, nutritional supplement companies, and other organizations. Equipped with assault rifles and automatic weapons, FDA agents clad in body armor have sought to dismantle the natural medicine industry, allegedly to safeguard the interests of drug companies and conventional medicine practitioners. This exposÃ© unveils the hidden chronicles of the FDA, shedding light on a history they prefer to keep under wraps. The following timeline offers a glimpse into the FDA's controversial actions, taken from the book "Natural Health Solutions and the Conspiracy to Keep You From Knowing About Them."  Related: The Top Three Most Censored Health Films and Books of 2016: "The Truth About Cancer" docu-series, "VAXXED" documentary, and "A Mind of Your Own" book on mental health through nutrition â€“ all three deemed threatening to the medical establishment.  1987: The Life Extension Raids  The Life Extension Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to disseminating information on the healing potential of nutritional supplements and anti-aging breakthroughs, has long been a target of FDA scrutiny. On February 26, 1987, a team of approximately 25 armed FDA agents and U.S. Marshals stormed the Life Extension Foundation's offices in Ft. Lauderdale, brandishing weapons. Simultaneously, another group of FDA agents raided the organization's warehouse, where they apprehended the founder, William Faloon, at gunpoint. Employees were compelled to line up against the wall while undergoing thorough searches. Agents rummaged through personal belongings and confiscated numerous items. Over the course of 12 hours, they seized thousands of nutritional products, files, and documents, including 5,000 newsletters scheduled for distribution to subscribers. Computers and telephones were forcibly removed from the walls, and agents seized any items they could find, regardless of whether they were listed in the search warrant. Subsequent analysis revealed that 80 percent of the confiscated items were never mentioned in the warrant. Astonishingly, the entire raid was based on fraudulent grounds. The search warrant, issued by Magistrate Lurana S. Snow, relied on perjured testimony from FDA agent Martin Katz. Yet, the intended effect of instilling fear within the Life Extension Foundation was achieved, as employees were haunted by nightmares and many hesitated to return to work.  Rather than succumbing to the FDA's tyranny, Bill Faloon”X¼  In Wisconsin, the organic industry is flourishing as residents embrace the benefits of healthy, pesticide-free foods. With the second highest number of organic farms in the nation, the state boasts a thriving organic beef, dairy, vegetable, and melon industry. However, the demand for these foods is outpacing the supply, creating a need for increased production. Despite this challenge, many view the surge in organic preferences as a positive trend towards healthier lifestyles.  Dr. Erin Silva, co-author of the "Organic Agriculture in Wisconsin 2015 Status Report," believes that the demand for organic foods will continue to grow. She states, "With the demand still strong, we don't foresee a potential erosion of the organic premium. The projections do continue to see demand increasing over the next five years or so." This demand is not only driven by increased health awareness but also by younger generations who are interested in organic farming.  The report, produced by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, highlights the importance of agriculture to the state's economy. Agriculture generates $88 billion annually for Wisconsin and contributes nearly 12 percent of the state's jobs. While organic production represents a small portion of this industry, it taps into a rapidly growing market. According to the Organic Trade Association, organic sales are increasing at a rate of nearly 12 percent per year, with 81 percent of U.S. families choosing organic food at least sometimes.  The report also emphasizes the importance of younger generations in maintaining the growth of organic agriculture in Wisconsin. As farmers grow older, bringing new faces into the profession becomes crucial. Many young and beginning farmers are enthusiastically entering organic agriculture and seeking support from educational, financial, and governmental institutions.  In conclusion, Wisconsin's organic agriculture industry is thriving due to the high demand for healthy foods. While the demand currently exceeds the supply, experts are optimistic that consumer and population trends will create a balance and meet everyone's needs. With the support of younger generations, the future of organic agriculture in Wisconsin looks promising.”X^  Consuming a high-sugar diet can have detrimental effects on the brain, comparable to the impact of abuse and trauma, according to a recent study published in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience. The study's researchers focused on how sugar affects the hippocampus, a part of the brain associated with stress and memory. They discovered that a high-sugar diet alters the hippocampus in a way that resembles the changes seen in individuals exposed to early life stress. This suggests that subjecting oneself to a high-sugar diet is akin to enduring abuse. The authors of the study, Jayanthi Maniam and Margaret Morris, express concern over the widespread consumption of sugar. They note that individuals who consume a "western" diet, high in sugar, have smaller hippocampal volumes, similar to findings in animal models. The authors stress the need to control excessive sugar intake, particularly in children aged nine to 16, as it could reduce the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. The study highlights the potential risks associated with excessive sugar consumption, including its addictive nature and impact on brain function. While sugar is known to contribute to obesity and diabetes, its effects on the brain and personality are just as concerning. Sugar has been found to act as a stress suppressant and can lead to addiction in individuals prone to seeking comfort.”X.
  Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the human body, plays a vital role in various bodily functions. It is involved in the contraction and dilation of blood vessels in the cardiovascular system, aids in muscle contraction, and assists in cell signaling and nerve transmission to the brain. While most people are familiar with calcium's importance for bone and teeth health, few are aware that powerful herbs such as horsetail and oat straw also contain this essential mineral.  Calcium levels in the bloodstream are tightly regulated, with any excess stored in bone and dental tissue. If the body requires more calcium, it will retrieve it from these sources. However, as the body ages, particularly among postmenopausal women, bone loss can outpace bone repair when dietary calcium intake is insufficient. Horsetail and oat straw can provide additional calcium to support bone health.  A clinical study conducted by the University of Maryland Medical Center in 1999 involved 122 women who took either horsetail extract or a calcium/horsetail product marketed in Italy. Both groups of women experienced improvements in bone density, suggesting the potential of horsetail in healing osteoporosis. Although the study does not meet current scientific standards, it still offers promise for horsetail's efficacy in treating this condition. Horsetail, also known as shave grass, contains high levels of plant silica, which converts to calcium in the body. The late master herbalist Dr. John Ray Christopher referred to horsetail as a "master calcium herb" and included it along with oat straw, comfrey root, and lobelia in his herbal calcium tea formula. C. Louis Kervran, a Nobel prize nominee, extensively discussed the similarities between plant silica and calcium in his book, Biological Transmutation.  Oat straw, the green oat grass in its "milky" stage before the oats mature, is also rich in calcium. Many herbalists recommend and utilize oat straw to strengthen bones in patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis. A clinical study published by Integrative Herbal Communications in 2000 showed that rats fed oat straw experienced an increase in luteinizing hormones. These hormones stimulate cell growth, including osteoblasts, which are cells responsible for promoting bone and teeth development.  To address calcium imbalances in the body, it is important to avoid refined white sugar, white flour products, alcohol, soft drinks, steroids, and junk foods. These substances can deplete calcium from the bones as the body seeks to correct acid formation in the blood and tissues. Conditions such as var”X…
  Obesity Rates Remain High in America, with Lack of Physical Activity as a Major Contributor  The prevalence of obesity in the United States continues to be a significant concern, despite some stabilization in recent years, according to government findings. While poor dietary choices are commonly cited as a leading cause of obesity, another factor that often receives less attention is the increasing lack of physical activity among Americans.  A recent study published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings sheds light on this issue, revealing that the average obese woman only engages in one hour of vigorous exercise per year, while men fare slightly better with less than four hours per year. The study tracked participants' movements over the course of a year, collecting data on the amount and intensity of exercise they engaged in. Vigorous exercise was defined as activities such as jogging or other high-cardio exercises that lead to fat burning. In some cases, walking was considered vigorous for individuals who were extremely overweight.  Researchers found that women, in particular, cited their busy lives as a major obstacle to regular exercise. Juggling work, caring for children, and prioritizing sleep left little time for fitness. "They're living their lives from one chair to another," explained Edward Archer, a research fellow with the Nutrition Obesity Research Center. "We didn't realize we were that sedentary. There are some people who are vigorously active, but it's offset by the huge number of individuals who are inactive."  While finding time for exercise is undoubtedly challenging in today's fast-paced world, experts emphasize that almost everyone can make room for some form of physical activity three to four times a week. The key is to find a fitness program that is sustainable and enjoyable.  To help individuals starting a fitness program, a group of fitness experts shared their recommendations. They advise individuals to gauge their starting point by taking photos and conducting fitness tests to track progress. Motivation is crucial, and setting small, achievable goals along the way can help individuals stay committed. Additionally, seeking support from others and not attempting to go it alone can enhance the chances of maintaining a fitness routine.  In conclusion, while poor dietary choices contribute to obesity rates in America, the lack of physical activity is often overlooked. The new study highlights the alarmingly low levels of exercise among obese individuals, particularly women. By recognizing the barriers and seeking out a fitness program that suits their lifestyle, individuals can take the necessary steps towards a healthier future.”X~
  Russia has implanted a dangerous malware program into the software that runs the majority of critical infrastructure in the United States, according to a warning issued by the Department of Homeland Security. This cyber operation has the potential to cause economic catastrophe throughout the country, similar to the concept of mutual assured destruction during the Cold War. Intelligence analysts believe that the United States has likely done the same to the infrastructure of Russia and possibly China. However, the potential impact on American financial infrastructure could be even more devastating, as the US financial and banking system, along with Wall Street, serve as the backbone for global trade and the world's largest economy. With the US dollar being the world's reserve currency, any disruption in the American economic system could lead to a collapse of the dollar and global financial chaos.  In addition to the major financial implications, national security sources and intelligence analysts have noted that the malware has also infiltrated other critical infrastructure systems, such as those used to control industrial operations like oil and gas pipelines, power grids, water distribution systems, wind turbines, and even nuclear plants. An attack on any of these vital systems could have a detrimental impact on millions of Americans, potentially leading to destruction and loss of life.  The Department of Homeland Security has warned that this hacking attack, sponsored by Russia, has been ongoing since 2011. While no attempt has been made to activate the malware and cause damage, modify, or disrupt America's industrial and infrastructure control processes, the uncertainty surrounding when and where the malware could be activated is cause for concern. DHS sources have expressed the belief that this is not a random attack, but rather a tactic taken from the Cold War playbook by the Russians, placing the malware in key US systems as a threat or deterrent to a potential US cyber-attack on Russian systems.  The penetration was discovered by insiders in the intelligence community in late October, at which point DHS' Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team issued an alert bulletin to industry members outlining the breach. The bulletin revealed that the same malware, known as "BlackEnergy," had been used earlier in the year by a Russian cyber-espionage group called "Sandworm" to target NATO, energy companies, and telecommunications companies in Europe. The DHS bulletin suggested that the shared command and control infrastructure between these campaigns indicates that they are part of a broader campaign by the same threat actor.”XL
  Upgrading Your Diet? Start with Green Smoothies  Many people are recognizing the importance of improving their diets, but sometimes the challenge lies in making the necessary changes. If you find yourself in this position, why not consider incorporating green smoothies into your daily routine as a first step towards a healthier lifestyle? Greens are not only essential for building and detoxifying the blood, but they are also packed with vitamins and minerals that most people do not consume enough of. Green smoothies offer a simple and delicious solution to this problem.  Typically, bananas form the base of green smoothies, and when peeled and frozen beforehand, they can provide a consistency similar to ice cream. Of course, you can always add your preferred fruits such as apples, pineapple, Mexican papaya (not Hawaiian), watermelon, strawberries, or grapes. To complete the smoothie, simply include a cup or so of greens like spinach, parsley, or dinosaur kale, along with water and a natural sweetener. Blend the ingredients together, and your green smoothie is ready.  If you are looking to make your green smoothie taste more like a dessert rather than a health drink, a small amount of stevia or organic honey can go a long way. Many individuals have noticed that incorporating green smoothies into their daily routine boosts their energy levels without the need for coffee. Moreover, it is an effortless and delicious way to enhance your diet without much effort.  Additionally, greens are abundant in chlorophyll, which aids in blood rebuilding. It is well-known that healthy blood is crucial for overall well-being, and clean and healthy blood seems to contribute to a vibrant appearance. Therefore, if you are feeling a little lackluster, incorporating green smoothies into your diet could be a way to address the underlying issue.  For individuals interested in further enhancing their green smoothies, superfoods like maca or the gel from a fresh aloe vera leaf can be added. However, for taste and simplicity reasons, it may be better to start slowly and gradually introduce these ingredients once you have established a routine. Alongside other fruits or soaked nuts, green smoothies also make an excellent breakfast option.  Kim Evans, the author of Cleaning Up! The Ultimate Body Cleanse, is a natural health writer who has helped many individuals improve their health and well-being. Her upcoming book explores events in her life that align with patterns found in the Bible. She believes that the Bible contains messages encouraging readers to make connections between their own lives and biblical narratives.”XŠ
  Whole Foods Market, the popular natural grocery chain, has finally announced its plans to require the labeling of all foods containing genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) sold in its stores. However, the new labeling requirements will not go into effect until 2018, a decision that has sparked controversy. Many are questioning why the company, known for its emphasis on natural and organic products, would wait five additional years to address this important issue.  In a statement on its website, Whole Foods expressed its strong support for food labeling transparency. The company has been working for years to voluntarily remove GMOs from its 365 Everyday Value line of products and has been a vocal advocate for the Non-GMO Project, an independent verification system aimed at eliminating GMOs from foods. Whole Foods aims to provide informed consumer choice when it comes to genetically-engineered ingredients and claims to be the first national grocery chain to set a deadline for full GMO transparency.  This move by Whole Foods is groundbreaking, signaling a significant step towards achieving real food transparency in our society. It also indicates that awareness about the presence of GMOs in the food supply is growing, with millions of Americans actively avoiding GMOs for the health of their families. This is positive news for everyone.  However, the question remains: why the extended timeline? Some speculate that since many of the food products sold at Whole Foods currently contain GMOs, the retailer is providing its suppliers and brands with more time to eliminate GMOs from their products before the labeling deadline. The company is likely trying to avoid having to label any products as containing GMOs by the time 2018 arrives. After all, it would be contradictory for a grocery store that prides itself on selling "nothing artificial, ever" to mark certain products with the equivalent of a warning sign.  Additionally, some argue that it is challenging to source organic or non-GMO ingredients for food products sold at Whole Foods. Many of the nation's sugar beets, canola, corn, and soybeans, for example, are grown using GM seed stocks. Transitioning from GM to certified-organic crop fields can take several years, making it difficult for some companies to immediately switch to non-GMO sources.  On the other hand, there are relatively large-scale food producers, like family-owned Nature's Path, who already use non-GMO, certified organic ingredients in their products without any issues. This raises the question of why other companies cannot do the same.  Although Whole Foods' decision to require GMO labeling is commendable, the long wait until 2018 has left”X8
  New Research Shows Isolated Soy Protein Benefits Type 2 Diabetes Patients  A recent study published in the renowned Journal of Nutrition has unveiled intriguing findings regarding the potential health advantages of isolated soy protein for individuals afflicted with type 2 diabetes. The research focused on male military veterans in the advanced stages of the disease who, through the consumption of soy protein, witnessed a significant reduction in unwanted proteins found in their urine. Additionally, their levels of HDL cholesterol, commonly referred to as the "good" cholesterol, experienced a slight increase. These outcomes hold tremendous promise for the treatment of the millions of Americans suffering from diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, as it currently affects 18 million individuals nationwide.  One of the primary complications faced by diabetics is diabetic kidney disease, which is often diagnosed by the presence of high protein levels in the urine. Typically, this protein, known as albumin, stems from animal-based proteins like cow's milk or whey protein. However, the study showcased that substituting animal-based proteins with soy protein can have a discernible positive impact on diminishing unwanted proteins in the urine, potentially promoting healthier kidney function among diabetic patients.  This research further aligns with my personal observations. For years, I have recommended whey protein as an excellent protein source for those adhering to low-carbohydrate diets or simply seeking alternative protein options to animal-derived products. Nonetheless, I have harbored reservations about the use of whey protein derived from cow's milk. Cow's milk, in my opinion, should be avoided by all humans. While it may be the ideal nourishment for calves, it lacks the necessary nutritional balance for human consumption, including essential nutrients like GLA that are crucial for optimal brain function.  Furthermore, cow's milk contains casein, an animal-based protein. Ingesting large quantities of casein has been linked to the development of diabetic kidney disease, resulting in elevated albumin levels in urine. However, the issues with casein extend beyond its connection to kidney disease. It has been associated with bodily stagnation, causing problems such as constipation, chronic sinus congestion, asthma, and excessive mucus in the lungs. Individuals in exceptional physical health can typically tolerate a considerable amount of casein in their diet without complications. However, those with compromised health, such as individuals with type 2 diabetes, may experience an expedited negative impact from casein consumption, potentially leading to chronic sinus congestion and pain.  In conclusion, the recent study highlighting the health benefits of isolated soy protein for type 2 diabetes patients is truly captivating”X
  In the not-too-distant past, the American Medical Association (AMA), self-proclaimed as the largest association of physicians in the United States, actively engaged in a campaign to undermine one of its biggest competitors. Even today, this competitor, chiropractic, is still questioned by many in the mainstream medical community regarding its legitimacy as a medical practice. In 1962, the AMA formed a "Committee on Quackery," which was officially disbanded in 1974 after facing public exposure. However, a federal judge later determined that the committee had been established with the sole purpose of orchestrating a conspiracy to systematically destroy a licensed profession.  The disdain that many conventional doctors have for chiropractors stems from the fact that chiropractors possess unique healing skills that are not typically taught in mainstream medical schools influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. Frustrated patients, who have found little relief from the pharmaceuticals prescribed by their conventional MDs for every ailment, often turn to chiropractors instead. Rather than humbly acknowledging that they do not possess all knowledge and truth, many conventional doctors within the AMA have conspired to dismantle the chiropractic profession. However, this mission has had unintended consequences, as patients continue to seek alternative treatments.  In 1987, a group of chiropractors successfully sued the AMA for violating antitrust laws in its efforts to "contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession." Judge Susan Getzendanner ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, agreeing that the AMA had unfairly branded all chiropractors as "unscientific cultists." This labeling harmed their practices and deprived chiropractors of normal association with medical physicians. Judge Getzendanner also criticized the AMA for damaging the reputation of chiropractors through its name-calling practices. She refuted the AMA's false claims that it had never intentionally targeted the chiropractic profession, stating, "There has never been an affirmative statement by the AMA that it is ethical to associate with chiropractors."  Despite this court conviction, the AMA continues to unlawfully target chiropractic and other natural healing arts. Since the victory for chiropractic in 1987, the medical profession in the United States has witnessed a further monopolization of medicine. While so-called "alternative" medicine, which refers to medical practices not endorsed by pharmaceutical companies, continues to thrive throughout the country, the AMA has expanded its conspiracy to wield power and influence whenever possible. The eye-opening documentary film "Doctored," currently available for streaming on Amazon Prime, delves into the sordid history of the medical profession. It reveals how the AMA,”X6
  Facebook's Growing Invasion of Privacy  In the ever-evolving realm of social media, Facebook continues to reign supreme. However, for the millions who maintain a love/hate relationship with the platform, there are now even more reasons to lean towards the latter. While it is widely known that Facebook collects and stores personal data to curate targeted advertising, the extent of its data mining goes beyond what users may realize.  In addition to tracking your preferences within the platform, Facebook also monitors the other websites you visit, gathering copious amounts of data. Not only that, but it also collects online search data and even some of the details you provide to retailers when making purchases. Facebook capitalizes on this wealth of information through partnerships with data brokers, entities that amass an assortment of demographic information and purchasing histories, among other personal details.  Bruce Schneier, a renowned data security expert, describes data brokers as entities that collect everything from names and addresses to political affiliations and property information. They compile lists of purchases, payment methods, and even keep track of personal events such as deaths and divorces within a family. Essentially, they collect everything about an individual's online activity.  While this information is primarily used for targeted advertising, many view it as an unlawful invasion of privacy. One of the main charges against Facebook is its deliberate attempt to conceal the magnitude of its data mining practices. Few users actually read the terms and conditions upon signing up, and even those who do often lack a true understanding of the privacy policies.  A recent article on Phys.org delves into the issue, highlighting how users remain unaware of the extent to which their personal data is collected across various social media platforms, including the content of their web-hosted emails. This data is then used to construct detailed personal profiles, raising concerns about the lack of control users have over their own information.  While Facebook claims that users can opt out of its data-mining practices, doing so proves to be challenging and ultimately futile. Data security experts argue that even if users manage to opt out, it makes little difference, as the data brokers already possess their personal information. Moreover, the collaboration between data brokers and Facebook may lead to even more detailed profiles of users' health and habits in the future.  In essence, Facebook and data brokers accumulate and store more personal information than even the National Security Agency (NSA), all while reaping substantial financial gains. As users navigate this digital landscape, it becomes increasingly important to remain vigilant and aware of the extent to which one's personal data is being harvested.”X¥
  Chemical Warfare's Long-Term Consequences: A Lesson from Agent Orange and DDT  In the pursuit of victory, modern man once believed that chemical warfare held the key to defeating enemies and gaining an upper hand in battle. This dangerous ideology, however, failed to consider the long-term repercussions of such tactics. Agent Orange, a notorious chemical weapon, serves as a haunting reminder of the devastating impact chemicals can have on both human health and the environment.  During the Vietnam War, 19 million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed over 4.5 million acres of land in an attempt to defoliate the region and provide American soldiers an advantage in the jungle. Little did they know that this toxic chemical would lead to a slew of health issues for returning US service personnel, including tumors, birth defects, psychological problems, and cancer. Agent Orange served as a grim preview of the havoc chemicals could wreak on the world.  A similar approach utilizing chemicals has been employed to combat pests in the natural world. Take DDT, for instance, which was created in laboratories and heavily utilized as a pesticide against mosquitoes. Due to its ability to dissolve in fats or oils, DDT easily accumulates in the tissues of animals and humans. Once inside the body, it disrupts cellular processes, leading to liver cancer, neurological dysfunction, and reproductive harm. Paradoxically, employing DDT to combat disease-carrying mosquitoes ultimately exacerbates widespread illness among the human population, as DDT persists for decades and accumulates at the top of the food chain.  In agricultural fields, another form of chemical warfare has been engineered to combat pests like the western corn rootworm, which causes significant crop loss. By splicing two strains of corn with different genes from the Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium, namely Cry3Bb1 and mCry3A, scientists created corn crops with inherent pesticidal properties. While initially effective, this synthetic technology has proven short-lived, as the rootworms are increasingly developing resistance. Consequently, this method poses more harm than good.  The medical world has not been immune to the pitfalls of chemical warfare either. Antibiotics were originally developed to swiftly eliminate bacteria. However, their widespread use has led to the evolution of superbugs, bacteria strains that are more robust and deadly than ever before. This unintended consequence underscores the short-sightedness of relying solely on chemical interventions in the fight against disease.  As a long-term strategy, chemical warfare proves to be flagrantly ignorant, failing to consider the broader consequences. This reality is further”X=   In a recent visit to the National Counterterrorism Center, President Barack Obama made some comments that were initially published by The New York Times but later removed. The original story, written by Peter Baker and Gardiner Harris and published on December 17, included a surprising admission by the president regarding the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. However, by the next day, December 18, the embarrassing passage was taken out of the article.  During a meeting with columnists, President Obama indicated that he did not watch enough cable television to fully understand the anxiety felt by Americans after the attacks. He also expressed his plans to increase his public arguments in response to Republicans who claim he is not doing anything. This admission from the president immediately drew criticism from his critics who believe he is out-of-touch and disinterested when it comes to national security.  The New York Times' decision to remove the offending passage and change the headline of the article multiple times garnered the attention of other journalists and Times watchers. The changes in the headline consistently portrayed Obama in a better light or Republicans in a worse light. The newspaper's actions raised questions about their motives and protection of the president.  In response to inquiries about the changes, The Times' reporters offered a dismissive explanation, stating that there was nothing unusual about the modifications. However, the changes made little sense and only fueled suspicion among those observing the situation.  Overall, the incident reflects the ongoing concern among critics that the mainstream media, including The New York Times, acts as a protective shield for President Obama, often downplaying any negative aspects of his administration while highlighting his successes.”XÚ	  Sea vegetables, such as edible seaweeds, often don't receive the attention they deserve in health food circles. While they may be more difficult to incorporate into meals compared to land vegetables like broccoli and carrots, sea vegetables offer a remarkable quality - their nutritional value has remained consistent for centuries. In contrast, regular fruits and vegetables are facing a decline in their nutritiousness due to soil erosion and environmental pollution. Sea vegetables, however, still contain over 70 minerals and phytonutrients. It's important to note that not all sea vegetables are created equal. While some can rival the nutritional powerhouses found in soil-based superfoods, others may be less impressive or even detrimental for certain individuals.  Let's take a look at some of the healthiest sea vegetables and the rejuvenating properties they possess. Kelp, for instance, is one of the most well-known sea vegetables and for good reason. It contains a wealth of vitamins and trace minerals, including vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K, making it a true powerhouse. Additionally, kelp is packed with protein, fiber, iodine, and sodium alginate, which helps remove radioactive particles from the body. Regular consumption of kelp, preferably in its raw form, has been linked to improved thyroid function, digestive health, and even blood purification.  Hijiki, another sea vegetable, closely follows kelp in terms of its nutritional value. Similar to kelp, hijiki contains iodine, fiber, protein, sodium alginate, and vitamins A and B. However, hijiki shines when it comes to its calcium content. In fact, it boasts more calcium than any other sea vegetable, making it an excellent choice for promoting bone health and protecting against osteoporosis and other bone diseases. Hijiki also contains notable levels of magnesium, phosphorous, iron, and potassium, which all play crucial roles in supporting our bodies' natural functions.  Kombu, a favorite among the Japanese, is an all-around seaweed that offers significant quantities of various vitamins and minerals due to its high mineral salt content. This versatile seaweed is rich in vitamins B, C, D, and E, iodine, calcium, fiber, protein, iron, and potassium. Notably, kombu also contains a rare nutrient called germanium, known for its skin healing properties.  Two other seaweeds worth mentioning are nori and agar. Nori is an excellent source of natural protein, making it a valuable option for vegetarians and vegans, as it contains between ”X  Parents across the country are voicing their concerns about the increasing presence of vaccine propaganda in public schools. According to a report by The Daily Sheeple, a reader submitted homework assignments allegedly obtained from an unidentified elementary school that aimed to indoctrinate young students into believing that vaccines are the only path to overall health. The papers, which were copyrighted in 1995, conveyed a message that without vaccines, society would suffer from a lack of health. This assignment, titled "Medicine," was given in a reading class, raising further concerns about the infiltration of unrelated topics with propaganda. One parent took a stand against this assignment by crossing it out entirely and writing a comment requesting different work. The parent argued that the issue of vaccines is complex and should be left to the child's healthcare provider and parents. The assignment itself promotes the idea that vaccines are necessary for a healthy lifestyle, claiming that they will prevent diseases like measles and mumps, despite evidence that even vaccinated children can contract and spread these diseases. By incorporating such propaganda into school assignments, there is a risk of indoctrinating children to blindly accept vaccination, making it easier for pharmaceutical companies and the government to push vaccines as the only route to good health, despite potential risks. Even popular children's show Sesame Street has joined in on promoting vaccines, with a YouTube video featuring Elmo advocating for their use.”X	  Gluten, a protein found in grains like wheat, semolina, kamut, barley, spelt, triticale, bulgur, and rye, plays a crucial role in creating the desired texture of baked goods. Its elastic properties help bind molecules together, resulting in fluffy bread or chewy bagels. However, for many individuals, gluten is an allergen that can trigger adverse reactions. Symptoms may manifest immediately or even days later. Gluten intolerance can lead to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, and Crohn's disease, as well as a range of other symptoms like irritable bowel syndrome, skin rashes, and headaches. The best way to avoid these complications is by adopting a gluten-free diet, which means steering clear of foods that contain gluten.  Giving up wheat, the primary flour used in commercial baked goods, pastas, and cereals, can be a daunting task. However, the increasing demand for gluten-free products has prompted the creation of numerous alternatives. Bakeries are now offering more gluten-free recipes to cater to this growing market.  Here are some guidelines from Rush University Medical Center to help avoid gluten:  1. Grains: To prevent reactions to gluten, it is advised to avoid foods containing wheat, semolina, kamut, barley, spelt, triticale, bulgur, rye, and other gluten-containing grains. This includes bread, pasta, cereals, muffins, bagels, cookies, cakes, gravies, croutons, bread crumbs, biscuits, rolls, pita, batter-fried foods, noodles, wheat-based tortillas, ice cream cones, bran, wheat germ, dumplings, pancake mixes, pies, pumpernickel and rye breads, cornbread, vermicelli, doughnuts, buns, pretzels, spaghetti, waffles, and pastries. Fortunately, there are gluten-free substitutes available in most health food and grocery stores.  2. Condiments and Seasonings: Many condiments and seasonings contain gluten, so it is essential to read labels carefully. Worcestershire sauce, MSG, modified food starch, malt products, bouillon, barley malt, soy sauce, and any salad dressings or gravies thickened with wheat or other gluten-based flour should be eliminated from the diet unless they are clearly labeled as gluten-free.  3. Alcoholic Beverages: Certain alcoholic drinks like beer, ale, light beer, and hard liquors made with gluten-containing grains should be avoided.”X
  Homeopathy, a controversial field of medicine, has long been dismissed by scientists as a scientific impossibility. The explanation that currently supports homeopathy, or the use of solutions containing no chemical atoms to produce a biological reaction, seems illogical and goes against our fundamental understanding of science. However, what if our education has only provided us with a partial truth? What if there is a missing piece of knowledge that could shed light on subjects like homeopathy and make them scientifically plausible?  After two years of research, I have uncovered this hidden area of science, which reveals the scientific explanation behind many controversial topics, including homeopathy. These findings are presented in my book, "Blinded by Science," where I expose the previously concealed aspects of our education. If we approach homeopathy from a different scientific perspective, rather than solely relying on chemistry, we can begin to comprehend its mechanisms.  Consider a puzzle: You are faced with three light switches, only one of which controls the light in the adjacent room. You have only two attempts to determine which switch is the correct one. Without being able to see the effect of the switches, it seems mathematically impossible to solve the puzzle. However, by approaching the problem from a different scientific angle, the solution becomes remarkably simple. The key lies in the heat generated by the light, rather than the light itself. By turning a switch on and off, and then feeling whether the light is hotter, you can determine which switch controls the light in just two attempts.  Applying this same idea to homeopathy, we can conclude that the focus on chemicals is irrelevant to understanding its workings. Instead, we must consider the vibrations emitted by the chemicals, which have an impact on biological changes. This concept of "vibrations" is the missing part of our education that holds the key to unlocking many mysteries. In the puzzle mentioned earlier, the light bulb heated up due to vibrations, demonstrating that both light and heat were at play. Similarly, our bodies operate on two levels - chemical and vibrational - and these two aspects are interdependent.  In conclusion, homeopathy may seem scientifically implausible based on our current understanding, but by delving into the concept of vibrations, we can gain a fresh perspective. This alternative scientific approach challenges conventional wisdom and has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of our bodies and the world around us.”X•
  Chipotle E. Coli Outbreak Officially Over, CDC Says  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) declared on February 1st that the Chipotle Mexican Grill E. coli outbreak has come to an end. This outbreak, which led to accusations of bioterrorism and corporate sabotage, has seemingly been contained after affecting numerous individuals across more than a dozen states. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, and public health officials in several states investigated two separate outbreaks of the bacteria. In the first outbreak, 55 people in 11 states were infected, with 21 of them requiring hospitalization. The second, smaller outbreak affected five people from three states, with one individual hospitalized.  Chipotle is now seeking to regain the trust of consumers and investors after experiencing a 30 percent decline in sales late last year, following six separate outbreaks of E. coli, norovirus, and Salmonella, all linked to the chain's restaurants. Some observers, familiar with the tactics employed by the biotech industry, have raised suspicions about the outbreaks. These suspicions have been fueled in part by Chipotle being the only fast food chain in the United States to publicly denounce the GMO industry and pledge to use only non-GMO ingredients. Additionally, the rarity of certain disease strains involved in the outbreaks has led to speculation that they were developed in laboratories and intentionally introduced into Chipotle's food supply by corporate saboteurs.  One of the individuals who has raised the alarm is selfnews founder Mike Adams, also known as the Health Ranger. In December 2015, Adams wrote, "As a clean food advocate myself, I know firsthand of the malicious tactics used by these biotech mafia operations, including tactics of intimidation and terrorism, such as calling in bomb threats to locations where clean food activists are about to speak. There is absolutely no question that the biotech industry will resort to ANY activity necessary to destroy food companies that oppose GMOs. And yes, this includes acts of bioterrorism against Chipotle - something that's ridiculously easy for biotech industry operatives to carry out with simple, low-cost laboratory supplies sold online at places like Amazon.com." Adams has publicly urged Chipotle to initiate a criminal investigation to uncover the truth behind the possible bioterrorism attacks on its restaurants by GMO industry operatives. He is not the only one questioning the situation and calling for a thorough investigation by authorities.  Even mainstream news sources, attempting to downplay the conspiracy theories, acknowledge that”X–  In the latest segment of our comprehensive six-part series, we delve into the critical significance of maintaining a proper diet to safeguard eye health and vision, exploring a selection of the finest foods for ocular well-being.

  Prescription drug abuse among children and adults is now as common and deadly as illegal street drugs, but a recent poll from the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health suggests that most parents are not concerned about this issue. Furthermore, parental support for policies aiming to restrict access to commonly abused narcotic painkillers is weak. Lead researcher, Sarah J. Clark, emphasizes that this is a growing national problem and the results of this poll indicate that parents may not be aware of the significant rates of misuse of narcotic pain medicine. Only 35 percent of parents expressed a high level of concern about the misuse of narcotic painkillers by children and teenagers in their communities, and even fewer (19 percent) were concerned about abuse within their own families. Interestingly, white parents showed the lowest rates of concern (13 percent) compared to Hispanic (26 percent) and black (38 percent) parents, despite the fact that painkiller abuse is more prevalent among white teenagers. White parents were also less likely to support policies that would limit children's access to prescription painkillers. The seriousness of the problem seems to be underestimated by parents, as studies have shown that narcotic painkillers cause more overdose deaths than cocaine and heroin combined, and rates of prescription drug abuse are equal to or higher than those of all illegal street drugs combined. Additionally, 75 percent of narcotic painkiller abusers obtain the drugs from someone with a valid prescription, often themselves, a friend, or a relative. The poll also revealed that children and teenagers can easily access these drugs, with 35 percent of parents admitting to receiving at least one pain drug for their children in the past five years, half of which were narcotics. Furthermore, 66 percent of parents received a prescription painkiller for at least one adult in their household in the past five years. Surprisingly, nearly 50 percent of parents surveyed did not support requirements to return unused pain drugs or obtain painkiller prescription refills only from a doctor's office. However, 66 percent of parents did support laws requiring identification before purchasing a narcotic painkiller for a child, and 57 percent supported regulations prohibiting individuals from obtaining a narcotic painkiller prescription from multiple doctors. Overall, the poll results indicate a low level of concern among parents about this issue, possibly due to the fact that narcotic pain medicine is prescribed by doctors.”XY	  FDA Approves New Flu Shot, Flublok, for 2013-2014 Season  In response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declaring the flu to be at an epidemic level, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new flu shot called Flublok. Manufactured by Protein Sciences Corp. in Meriden, Connecticut, Flublok offers potential advantages over traditional flu vaccines. Unlike most vaccines that are grown in chicken eggs, Flublok can be made quickly because it does not require this process. This is particularly beneficial in the event of an epidemic.   Flublok contains three times the active ingredients as the regular flu shot, making it potentially more effective. Additionally, it is safer for individuals with egg allergies as it does not contain any egg. Furthermore, Flublok does not contain adjuvants or mercury, addressing concerns raised by health advocates. However, questions remain regarding the use of insect cells in the manufacturing process, as there is no research on potential human health implications.  The main ingredient in Flublok is hemagglutinin (HA), the influenza virus protein. This protein is created in a lab using cells of insects grown in steel tanks, rather than eggs. According to Karen Midthun, M.D, the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, this new technology allows for faster vaccine production during a pandemic, as it is not reliant on an egg supply or influenza virus availability.   Flublok contains three full-length recombinant HA proteins to protect against two strains of influenza virus A (H1N1 and H3N2) and one strain of influenza virus B. In clinical trials, Flublok showed 44.6 percent effectiveness, and tests with 195 participants indicated increased seroprotection rates, suggesting potential for higher immunity. However, further research is needed to confirm these theories.  In light of the availability of Flublok, the CDC advises Americans to get a flu shot. However, natural remedies to boost immunity, such as adding vitamin D to the diet, continue to be recommended. For more information on natural flu remedies, readers can visit selfnews.com.

  GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), a British registered company, has been charged with a record-breaking $3 billion penalty after pleading guilty to what is being called the largest health care fraud case in history. GSK has admitted to bribing physicians to promote potentially harmful drugs in exchange for lavish incentives such as Madonna tickets, Hawaiian holidays, cash, and lucrative speaking tours. Additionally, GSK confessed to distributing misleading information about the antidepressant Paxil, falsely claiming its suitability for children while ignoring data from studies that proved its ineffectiveness in children and adolescents.  The company faced accusations that it utilized these unethical practices to sell three drugs that were either unsafe or used for unapproved purposes. The first drug, known as Paxil or Seroxat, was marketed as safe and effective for children and adolescents. However, its inefficacy and its link to suicides led to its ban for individuals under 18 in 2008. The second drug, Avandia, was used in Britain to treat diabetes until it was withdrawn due to safety concerns, including an increased risk of heart attacks. The US government alleged that GSK attempted to hide data related to these dangers. The third drug, Wellbutrin, is used in the UK to treat depression, but it was alleged that GSK recommended physicians to prescribe it for ADHD, decreased libido, and as a weight loss aid - none of which were approved uses for the drug.  Sir Andrew Witty, the chief executive of GSK, acknowledged the company's wrongdoings, stating, "Whilst these offenses originate in a different era for the company, they cannot and will not be ignored. On behalf of GSK, I want to express our regret and reiterate that we have learned from the mistakes that were made. We are deeply committed to doing everything we can to live up to and exceed the expectations of those we work with and serve. In the US, we have taken action at all levels in the company. We have fundamentally changed our procedures for compliance, marketing, and selling."  Carmen Ortiz, the US attorney for Massachusetts, described how GSK's sales force resorted to bribing physicians using various extravagant forms of entertainment, ranging from Hawaiian vacations to paying doctors millions of dollars for speaking tours, European pheasant hunts, and even tickets to Madonna concerts. This settlement marks the largest in the history of the drug industry, surpassing the 2009 Pfizer case where the company was fined $2.2 billion for promoting four drugs for unapproved uses. GSK had”X©	  A recent study conducted by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has found that dietary supplements of folate and vitamin B12 can alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia, a disabling brain disorder that affects the ability to distinguish between reality and imagination, is characterized by two types of symptoms - positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, and negative symptoms, including social withdrawal and a lack of emotional expressiveness. While drugs have been successful in treating positive symptoms, there has been a lack of effective treatments for negative symptoms. This study, published in JAMA Psychiatry, is the first to investigate the use of folate and B12 supplementation to treat negative symptoms.  The study included 140 patients with schizophrenia, who were given either a placebo or folate and B12 supplements in addition to their regular treatments. The results showed improvement in all participants, with the most significant improvement observed in those carrying specific genetic variants involved in folate metabolism. According to Joshua Roffman, MD, MMSc, of the MGH Department of Psychiatry and corresponding author of the study, the findings open up a new potential avenue for treating schizophrenia, particularly the debilitating negative symptoms. He also emphasized the importance of personalized medical approaches to treating the condition, as the effects of the treatment varied based on the genetic variants present in each participant.  So why would folate have a positive impact on schizophrenia? The researchers note that folate is essential for DNA synthesis and neurotransmitter production, and it plays a role in regulating gene expression. Previous studies have linked folate deficiency during pregnancy with an increased risk of schizophrenia in offspring. The MGH-based team's earlier research also found that low blood folate levels were associated with more severe negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Dr. Roffman explained that folate's effects on negative symptoms may be due to its role in DNA methylation, which regulates gene expression.  Further research is needed to investigate the long-term benefits of folate supplementation, especially in patients with specific genetic variants. Understanding the neural mechanisms of folate in individuals with schizophrenia could help develop more targeted interventions to reduce and potentially prevent symptoms.”Xü	  Doctors Across the Country Engage in Controversial Off-Label Prescribing for Weight Loss  A recent report in the Wall Street Journal revealed that many doctors in the United States are prescribing medications for weight loss that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose. This practice, known as "off-label" prescribing, involves doctors prescribing drugs that are typically used to treat other conditions, such as antidepressants or anti-seizure medications, to help patients lose weight.  According to the Wall Street Journal article, some popular off-label weight loss drugs include ADHD medications like Adderall and Ritalin, as well as antidepressants like Wellbutrin. However, experts caution that there is no evidence to support the safety or efficacy of using these drugs for weight loss.  Pharmaceutical companies warn against using their products for weight loss, as they can have side effects such as abdominal pain and anxiety. Despite these warnings, sales of off-label drugs have skyrocketed in recent years. For example, sales of Adderall have increased by 3,000 percent, while Wellbutrin has seen a 1,000 percent sales increase since 2003, generating $1.4 billion in revenue in 2005.  Critics argue that doctors who engage in off-label prescribing may have financial incentives to do so, as these medications tend to be more expensive. They claim that obese patients require more than just diet and exercise to lose weight. Dr. Robert Skversky, a bariatric surgeon in California, defends off-label prescribing and says he prescribes a combination of drugs, including antidepressants and the weight-loss drug phentermine, to his patients. He believes that the benefits of these prescriptions outweigh the potential side effects and instructs his patients to take them for the rest of their lives.  However, not all recipients of off-label prescriptions agree that the side effects are worth the weight loss. Theresa Saleeby, a resident of New Jersey, reported losing only three pounds after seven months of taking Topamax, an anti-seizure drug she was prescribed despite not having seizures. Saleeby experienced memory loss, numbness in her legs, and severe hair loss as a result of the drug. She told the Wall Street Journal, "I'd rather be chubby than bald."  Critics of off-label prescribing, like Mike Adams, argue that there is no evidence to support the safety or effectiveness of these drugs for weight loss. Adams, an outspoken critic of prescription drug abuse, believes that the FDA turns a”XO	  Obesity Could Soon Have a Devastating Impact on Global Economy, World Bank Warns  Malnutrition has long been a major concern for the world's poorest countries, with a negative impact on their economic productivity. However, a recent report from the World Bank suggests that obesity could soon have as severe an effect on economic output as malnutrition. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that obesity rates have tripled in the past two decades. If no action is taken, it is projected that 10 percent of children and 20 percent of adults in Europe and Central Asia will be obese by 2010.  Dr. Meera Shekar, a senior nutrition specialist with the World Bank, explains that malnutrition currently reduces the gross domestic product (GDP) by two to three percent in the hardest-hit countries. The growing rate of obesity could have a similar impact. She adds, "We suspect that these estimates will be just as high" for obesity. In fact, obesity already accounts for six percent of health costs in the WHO's European region, with significant financial implications. For instance, in 2002, France incurred direct costs of $6.41 billion due to obesity, while the state of California faced $22 billion in both direct and indirect costs in 2000.  Additionally, obesity is expected to reduce life expectancy, which would directly affect the global economy. A recent study in Britain projected that if current trends continue, men could live five years less by 2050 due to the global obesity problem. Dr. Shekar emphasizes that the economic consequences will be particularly detrimental to developing economies, as the prevalence of obesity is increasing in these regions. Notably, obesity has recently emerged as a significant problem in the Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America.  Interestingly, the prevalence of obesity seems to shift from the wealthier segments to the poorer ones in developing countries. This trend is evident in France, where obesity is five times more common among low-income groups compared to high earners, according to WHO Regional Adviser Dr. Franceso Branca.  The alarming rise in obesity rates worldwide has raised concerns among experts about its potential economic impact. As governments and organizations grapple with this growing problem, urgent action is needed to mitigate the potential consequences on both health and the global economy.”XÕ
  Broccoli, the cruciferous vegetable that originated in the Italian province of Campania, has been revered for its healing properties since ancient times. When Italian immigrants introduced broccoli to the United States in the early 20th century, it quickly gained popularity among settlers and continues to be a favorite vegetable today. In fact, broccoli consumption in the West has increased by over 940 percent in the past 25 years, likely due to the growing body of evidence highlighting its numerous health benefits.  One of the main reasons broccoli is considered a nutritional powerhouse is its cancer-fighting properties. Research has shown that the vegetable is effective in preventing and treating various types of cancer. A review published in Recent Patents on Endocrine Metabolic & Immune Drug Discovery in 2013 concluded that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli exhibit anti-tumor activity. The study also highlighted the antioxidant properties of isothiocyanates, compounds found in broccoli, which can inhibit the growth of cervical, pancreatic, hepatocellular, and ovarian cancer cells. Another review published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention in 2013 attributed broccoli's anti-cancer benefits to its concentrations of isothiocyanates, although further research is needed to fully understand the chemopreventive effects of these compounds.  In addition to its cancer-fighting abilities, broccoli is packed with essential vitamins. Just one cup of chopped broccoli provides 135 percent of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin C and 116 percent of the RDA of vitamin K. Vitamin C acts as a powerful antioxidant, combating cell-damaging free radicals and aiding in collagen synthesis, which promotes anti-aging benefits. Vitamin K, on the other hand, supports blood clot formation and maintains bone health. Without sufficient vitamin K, individuals may experience excessive bleeding and potentially develop bone diseases like osteoporosis.  Broccoli also offers protection against environmental toxins. A study published in Clinical Immunology in 2009 revealed that sulforaphane, a molecule found in isothiocyanates, can shield individuals from respiratory inflammation caused by asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory conditions. According to the study, sulforaphane increases the production of antioxidant enzymes, guarding against excessive free radical exposure associated with pollution, vehicle fumes, and cigarette smoke. Regular consumption of broccoli, which is one of the richest natural sources of sulforaphane, may help protect individuals from environmental toxins.  Furthermore, broccoli is rich in fiber and other essential nutrients. One cup of chopped broccoli provides 9 percent”Xó   Japan, despite being in the midst of the worst radiological disaster in history, has been selected as the host nation for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Dubbed the "Safe Games", the decision raises concerns about the safety of hosting such an event in a country with no viable evacuation routes from a deteriorating nuclear facility. Prime Minister Abe, however, assures that Fukushima poses no threat and is fully under control.  The government's reassurances may sound familiar, as they echo a propaganda campaign funded by the Japanese government, claiming that radiation would not harm individuals if they simply drank beer or remained positive. Dr. Yamashita, referred to as "Dr. Fullashita" by English speakers, was enlisted by the government to promote the idea that happiness and laughter can make one immune to radiation poisoning. His assertions, which lack scientific basis, include statements such as "radiation doesn't affect people who are smiling" and "happy drinkers are less affected by radiation."  This tactic of downplaying the health risks of radiation is not new. Over a century ago, during the early days of elemental discovery, mainstream scientists believed that radioactive elements like radium provided extra energy to the human body. Radiation pills were prescribed alongside mercury pills for digestive disorders, in what was considered state-of-the-art medicine. Those who questioned the dangers of radiation or the toxicity of mercury were dismissed as quacks.  Interestingly, many of the scientists and doctors who dealt with these radiation pills ultimately succumbed to cancer themselves. This serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the potential dangers of underestimating the long-term effects of radiation exposure.  As Japan prepares to host the Olympic Games, concerns about the safety of athletes and visitors persist. The government's insistence on the safety of Fukushima, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, raises questions about their true motivations and the potential risks involved.”XÂ
  Texas Healthcare Company Accused of Expediting Deaths of Hospice Patients in Pursuit of Profits  A Texas-based healthcare company is under fire for allegedly hastening the deaths of hospice patients through drug overdoses, all in the name of increasing profits. According to a report by NBC 5, Novus Health Care Services, Inc., founded by 34-year-old Brad Harris in 2012, stands accused of engaging in these disturbing practices. Novus, headquartered in Frisco, has faced accusations from former employees who claim that Harris callously made comments about patients living too long and instructed nurses to administer excessive amounts of medication to speed up their deaths. These allegations were detailed in an affidavit for a search warrant obtained by local news, which stated that Harris directed a nurse to administer overdoses to three patients and instructed another employee to increase a patient's medication to four times the maximum allowable dose.  Harris, an accountant with no medical background, allegedly wrote in a text to one of his nurses, "You need to make this patient go bye-bye." While it remains unclear whether any patients were harmed as a result of Harris' lethal directives, it appears that healthcare providers have an incentive to expedite patient deaths due to the financial limitations they face. NBC 5 reports that hospices are subject to an "aggregator cap," which sets limits on Medicare and Medicaid payments based on the average annual hospice stay. Providers may have to reimburse the government if patients live longer than expected. Consequently, hospice providers are motivated to enroll patients with shorter stays, as this minimizes the risk of financial penalties.  Novus first came to the attention of the FBI in 2014 when allegations surfaced that the company was recruiting patients who did not qualify for services and fraudulently billing the government for unnecessary medical treatments. It was during this investigation that authorities discovered Harris' more sinister practices. The FBI affidavit revealed that Harris, despite lacking medical training or licenses, would instruct his nurses to overdose hospice patients with palliative medications such as morphine, all in an effort to hasten death and reduce Novus' financial liabilities.  In September 2015, the FBI conducted a raid on Novus' offices, but the court records pertaining to the search remain sealed. It appears that Harris was determined to maximize profits at the expense of patient well-being. He handpicked which home healthcare patients would be transferred to hospice care, disregarding their medical needs. The FBI agent involved in the case stated that Harris achieved this by having non-doctor employees sign certifications”X
  European researchers recently made an exciting discovery in the field of hair care: a breakthrough cure for grey and thinning hair. This groundbreaking remedy involves a topical application of a sun-activated compound called PC-KUS, which is essentially a modified form of pseudocatalase. However, while this discovery may be new to the scientific community, it seems that herbalists have known about this solution for centuries. Onion juice, a long-standing remedy for thin and greying hair, has been found to be effective in promoting hair growth and preventing grey hair.  The researchers found that the primary cause of grey hair is a buildup of hydrogen peroxide at the root of hair follicles. This buildup is largely due to a reduction in the natural antioxidant compound catalase. Onion juice not only helps cleanse the scalp and follicles but also promotes the production of catalase, preventing grey hair and promoting thicker hair follicles. This "new" breakthrough seems to be a rediscovery of a remedy that herbalists have been using for centuries.  John Gerard, a renowned herbalist from the 16th and 17th centuries, wrote about the benefits of onion juice for hair growth. He stated that applying onion juice to a bald head in the sun would quickly bring back hair. Today, many herbalists still recommend onion juice as a remedy for grey and thinning hair, either on its own or in combination with other natural ingredients.  The research, published in The FASB Journal, also revealed that the modified catalase compound is effective in treating vitiligo, a skin pigment condition characterized by the loss of skin color. Dr. Karin U. Schallreuter, the study author from the Institute for Pigmentary Disorders, emphasized the positive impact of successful repigmentation on the quality of life for individuals affected by this condition.  This recent discovery aligns with previous research conducted by Bradford University in the UK in 2009. That study also found that hydrogen peroxide buildup was a contributing factor to grey hair and that catalase could reverse the greying process.  While there have been numerous natural remedies for grey hair over the years, some of which have shown mixed results, a few have gained recognition. Fo-ti, an oriental remedy also known as he shou wu, has a long history of use for grey hair. Black strap molasses has been successful for many in restoring hair color, although it may require some time to see results. Pine needle tea has also been used to combat greying hair. Additionally, moringa leaf and root”X
  An investigation conducted by NBC Bay Area in November 2014 has uncovered a disturbing practice within the oil and gas industry. It has been discovered that billions of gallons of toxic wastewater have been pumped into federally protected underground aquifers. This revelation sheds light on the previously unknown composition of the injection mixture used in fracking, which consists of over 200 different chemicals, including diesel, biocides, and benzene.  Earlier reports suggested that groundwater contamination resulting from fracking was due to equipment malfunctions. However, NBC Bay Area's investigation reveals a more sinister truth. When oil and gas companies engage in fracking, they inject large amounts of water into the ground. In some cases, the resulting wastewater is reinjected into the same location where oil extraction occurred. However, there are instances where the wastewater is disposed of in nearby aquifers that are considered 'exempt' by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), meaning they are not suitable for human consumption or use, according to Jason Marshall, Chief Deputy Director for California's Department of Conservation.  NBC Bay Area's investigation initially identified nine wastewater injection wells where the wastewater was being injected into 'non-exempt' or clean aquifers containing high-quality water. However, the California Water Resources Control Board now suspects that a total of 532 injection wells have been dumping toxic wastewater into protected clean water aquifers. State officials have apparently allowed oil and gas companies to dump these toxic chemicals into 'pristine' federally protected underground aquifers throughout California, including in locations such as Santa Clarita, Santa Barbara, Fresno, Paso Robles, Los Angeles, and Kern County.  Over the years, oil and gas companies have been permitted to reinject wastewater into aquifers that already contained higher levels of solids and chemicals, known as 'exempt aquifers' by the EPA. Shockingly, state regulators have now issued permits to oil and gas companies to inject this same wastewater into 'non-exempt' aquifers. These aquifers, which are crucial resources in a state experiencing severe drought conditions, have potentially suffered irreparable damage. They could have been used for drinking water, to water animals, and for irrigation purposes.  Hollin Kretzmann from the Center for Biological Diversity in San Francisco expressed his outrage, calling the situation 'inexcusable.' Communities that rely on water supply wells near these injection sites have legitimate concerns about the high levels of arsenic, thallium, and other chemicals found in close proximity to these wells. The investigation by NBC Bay Area has shed light on a deliberate act with far-reaching consequences for”XV  Pregnant Women Struggle for Workplace Accommodations  In a concerning trend, employers are frequently resisting requests for special accommodations from pregnant women, according to a report released on June 18, 2013. This issue was brought to the forefront in 2007 when Heather Myers, an 18-year-old pregnant employee at Walmart, was fired for drinking water from a bottle. Myers, who had been informed during her worker orientation meeting that drinking water on the job was acceptable, found herself facing a sudden change in policy by her supervisor. The new rule stated that drinking water during work hours required a doctor's note. Myers, attempting to comply, promptly obtained the required note. However, her supervisor then introduced another rule, insisting that only fountain water was acceptable and drinking from a water bottle was not.  At the time, Myers was suffering from a urinary tract infection, a common condition during pregnancy that necessitates increased hydration. Her options were limited: either refrain from hydrating, unless using a fountain, or leave her job. She chose the latter and subsequently filed a lawsuit.   While some businesses do provide certain courtesies to pregnant workers, such as more frequent bathroom breaks and the ability to sit instead of standing, the issue of hydration remains crucial. Expectant mothers should be allowed to drink water more often, as is recommended. Proper hydration is vital during pregnancy due to the significant increase in blood volume, which can reach up to 40 percent. Water, as the primary component of human blood, carries nutrients to cells and removes toxins from the body. Additionally, hydration helps replenish the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby, regulates body temperature, and prevents dehydration-induced uterine contractions that can lead to premature labor.  Ultimately, maintaining a healthy pregnancy requires proper hydration. As pregnant women fight for their right to reasonable accommodations in the workplace, it is essential that employers acknowledge the importance of hydration and support the well-being of their employees.”Xæ
  Not all vitamins and dietary supplements are created equal. It turns out that many popular supplement brands contain artificial additives, synthetic flow agents, chemical colorings, and even imitation vitamin compounds that your body cannot fully process. So how can you ensure that the vitamins and supplements you purchase are safe and effective? Here are six helpful tips to keep in mind when buying these products.  Firstly, it is important to understand the distinction between natural vitamins found in food and the so-called vitamins added to many popular dietary supplements. Whole-food based vitamins are naturally occurring in foods, plants, and herbs, making them uniquely bioavailable. On the other hand, synthetic vitamins are manufactured in a laboratory and may be derived from toxic sources such as coal tar and petroleum. Identifying the difference can be as simple as checking the ingredient labels. Synthetic vitamins are typically listed by their isolated names, such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and dl-alpha tocopherol acetate (vitamin E), which are commonly added to vitamins and supplements, including multivitamin formulas. It is advisable to stick with whole food-based vitamins and supplements that clearly state their origin from plants or other natural sources. The Organic Consumers Association (OCA) explains that synthetic vitamins lack the naturally occurring essential synergistic co-factors and transporters found in whole food-based alternatives, resulting in a degraded cell.  Secondly, it is worth noting that even reputable supplement brands may include an additive called magnesium stearate. This flow agent additive can potentially impede the absorption of nutrients over time. Despite its name, magnesium stearate does not provide any nutritive magnesium and has been linked to the formation of a harmful 'biofilm' in the intestines, leading to digestive issues. Manufacturers add this substance to their products solely to facilitate processing during manufacturing. However, the long-term health consequences of consuming magnesium stearate may outweigh its benefits.  Additionally, titanium dioxide is an unnecessary additive found in many supplements. Often used as a pigment, this substance poses its own health risks. Titanium dioxide is an untested nanoparticle powder made from titanium bits and has been associated with autoimmune disorders, cancer, and various other diseases. Not only does it belong to a class of particles known to cause cell damage, but it also serves no therapeutic purpose in health supplements. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified titanium dioxide as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen, meaning it is potentially carcinogenic to humans, according to the Canadian”XÌ  Matt Monarch, the founder of Raw Food World, has announced his plan to take legal action against Adya, Inc. for damages, product misrepresentation, and fraud. Monarch claims that he has been financially devastated by his dealings with Adya, Inc., as his company voluntarily offered refunds to customers who had purchased Adya Clarity. Raw Food World was the largest distributor for Adya Clarity in North America. Monarch alleges that Adya, Inc. has not honored any refunds and has even refused to refund unopened product that was returned to them. Furthermore, Adya, Inc. is threatening to sue Monarch for approximately $200,000, claiming that he owes them for product that he attempted to return. In response to these actions, selfnews is initiating legal action against Adya, Inc. to seek a court-ordered halt to the importation and distribution of their products in order to protect consumers. Matt Monarch released a statement expressing his disbelief at Adya, Inc. suing his family. He highlighted how, eight months ago, his company voluntarily offered refunds for the Adya Clarity product, which has been a financially draining process. Monarch mentioned that they have hired additional employees to handle this crisis, and he and his wife have invested all of their personal liquid assets into this process without any compensation from Adya, Inc. Monarch emphasized that Raw Food World was the first raw food company to offer refunds and accused other companies of not following through on their refunds. He expressed his frustration that Adya, Inc. is now suing him and threatening to sue him for defamation. Monarch intends to vigorously defend against these claims and questions why Adya, Inc. is taking legal action against him.”Xj
  In a recent report, the European Union Food Safety Authority (EFSA) appeared to give Monsanto a victory by stating that their popular herbicide, glyphosate, is unlikely to be a carcinogen. However, a closer examination of the report reveals a different conclusion: while glyphosate itself may not cause cancer, the actual products that farmers and consumers are exposed to, such as Roundup, are likely to cause genetic damage that could lead to cancer. This is a significant acknowledgement by a government safety agency that inactive ingredients in chemical products may be just as dangerous as the active ingredients.  Roundup is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, especially since the introduction of Monsanto's Roundup Ready genetically modified crops. In the United States alone, 250 million pounds of glyphosate are applied each year. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as a probable carcinogen after an extensive review of research.  The EFSA report is part of a re-evaluation of glyphosate that will be used by EU member states to determine whether to continue allowing its use within their borders. The report acknowledged the potential toxicity of glyphosate by setting an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 0.5 mg per kg of body weight for the chemical. This is the first time any government has established an ARfD for glyphosate. An ARfD is the amount of a substance that can be safely consumed in food over a short period of time, such as one meal or one day.  The EFSA's report addressed the discrepancy between its conclusions and those of the IARC. The EFSA focused solely on glyphosate on its own, while the IARC reviewed studies on glyphosate formulations that included other ingredients, such as Roundup. This is because EU regulations require each chemical mixture to be assessed and marketed separately. As a result, the EFSA suggested that it is likely the supposedly inactive ingredients in Roundup and other glyphosate-containing herbicides that caused the genetic damage observed in the IARC studies.  The EFSA's findings highlight flaws in the regulatory system. While certain studies suggest that glyphosate-based formulations may be damaging to DNA, studies that solely examine the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect. This suggests that the genotoxic effects observed in some glyphosate-based formulations are likely due to the presence of other ingredients. Additionally, certain glyphosate-based formulations have been found to be more toxic than the active ingredient alone, presumably due to the presence of these”Xì  Drinking excessive amounts of diet soda may be more lethal than smoking a pack of cigarettes, according to recent research. Despite cigarettes containing over 4,000 chemicals, the leading chemical in diet soda could potentially breed more cancer cells and lead to malignant tumors earlier in life. Depression may also play a role in the development of cancer, as it kills brain neurons and expedites cell death. Chronic depression fuels overwhelming cell mutation and the takeover of organs by mutagenic cells, also known as blood cancer.  Smokers are trapped in a cycle of addiction, using nicotine to boost their ambition and dopamine levels. However, the aftermath of smoking, which involves exposure to thousands of chemicals and waiting for the nicotine to subside, is just the beginning of lung cancer and cell mutation. Cancer thrives in an acidic body that lacks oxygen and nutrients. Artificial sweeteners, on the other hand, are even more dangerous than cigarettes. They deceive the body into thinking they are food, polluting cleansing organs with mutagens. Some research suggests that the body does not fully excrete artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sorbitol, sucralose, or saccharin. These sweeteners cause the liver, kidneys, and pancreas to overwork and become malnourished, organs that are vital for survival. Aspartame, a GMO, infects the blood with synthetic carcinogens, causing central nervous system disorders and increased hunger.  It is well-established that obesity is a driving force behind cancer. Therefore, whether one consumes excess sugar or artificial sweeteners, they are feeding the same destructive forces in the body, altering DNA and leading to long-term effects with no cure. In summary, drinking three or four diet sodas per day may be more dangerous than smoking a pack of cigarettes. While diet sodas contain fewer chemicals, the specific chemicals in these beverages are more detrimental to cells and DNA, leading to chronic digestive disorders, breakdown of the central nervous system, and the development of cancerous tumors. This process is essentially programmed cell death, with mitochondria cells suffocating. When combined with toxic foods and medications prescribed by Western doctors, these addictions can program an early death.”X‹	  Pecans Offer Greater Health Benefits Than Previously Thought, Study Finds  A recent study published in The Journal of Nutrition has revealed that pecans provide even more health benefits than previously believed. Researchers from Loma Linda University (LLU) in California have identified a range of beneficial antioxidants in pecans that promote heart health, lower bad cholesterol levels, and protect against inflammation that can lead to disease.  Led by Dr. Ella Haddad and her team from LLU, the study involved 16 men and women aged between 23 and 44. Participants were assigned to one of three diets: the first included approximately three ounces of whole pecans, the second included three ounces of blended pecans with water, and the third served as the control group.  Blood samples were taken from the participants at various intervals up to 24 hours after consuming the meals. The researchers observed a clear increase in oxygen radical absorbance capabilities (ORAC) and lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol among those who consumed the pecan-enriched meals.  "Our tests show that eating pecans increases the amount of healthy antioxidants in the body," said Dr. Haddad, who is also an associate professor at LLU's School of Public Health. "This protective effect is important in helping to prevent the development of various diseases such as cancer and heart disease."  Pecans are rich in tocopherols, a natural form of vitamin E. In particular, they contain high levels of gamma-tocopherols, which are closely associated with reducing inflammation. The study found that blood levels of gamma-tocopherols doubled within eight hours of consuming pecans. Furthermore, after just three hours, these levels notably decreased LDL cholesterol by 33 percent.  "This study is further evidence that pecans are a healthy food," added Dr. Haddad. "Previous research has shown that pecans contain antioxidant factors. Our study shows that these antioxidants are indeed absorbed in the body and provide a protective effect against diseases."  A previous study conducted by LLU and published in The Journal of Nutrition demonstrated that incorporating pecans into one's diet can lower cholesterol levels by 116.5 percent more than the American Heart Association's (AHA) Step I diet. Together, these two studies confirm the remarkable health-promoting power of pecans.  Sources: http://www.lef.org/news/LefDailyNews.htm?New...”X[
  Title: The Costly Paradox of Cancer Treatment: A Look into the Controversial World of Medicinal Remedies  In a constant battle between the pill-pushing giants of the pharmaceutical industry and the skeptics of natural remedies, the debate over the efficacy and cost of cancer treatments rages on. With their persistent claims that natural remedies are nothing more than a ripoff, Big Pharma has successfully cast doubt on the effectiveness of alternative therapies. However, a new cancer treatment drug called Folotyn, manufactured by the modest drug company Allos Therapeutics, challenges this notion. With a staggering price tag of $30,000 per month, or around $1,000 a day, Folotyn enters the scene without any proven ability to save lives.  This raises an important question regarding the credibility of the conventional medicine pushers' criticism of natural remedies. When natural remedies lack scientific proof, they are swiftly denounced as "quackery." Yet, when their own exorbitantly priced medicines are also unproven, no qualms are voiced. The message is clear: unquestioningly take your medicine and refrain from asking any further questions. Why bother with scientific evidence when the confidence of being right is already firmly entrenched?  It is worth noting, however, that Folotyn has demonstrated the ability to shrink tumors by 27%. Interestingly, the same outcome can be achieved through the consumption of vitamin D, spirulina, green tea, medicinal mushrooms, and other anti-cancer nutritional therapies. Even if one were to fully commit to an extensive collection of anti-cancer supplements and pursue an aggressive regimen, it would be difficult to spend more than $2,000 on these products in a single month. This amounts to a remarkable $28,000 in savings compared to Folotyn. Furthermore, these supplements offer additional benefits to brain health, heart health, liver health, kidney health, and immune health. Alternatively, exercising outdoors provides an ample supply of free vitamin D and exercise, saving a staggering $30,000 per month while simultaneously addressing cancer treatment. It is also crucial to eliminate cancer-causing chemicals found in foods, personal care products, home cleaning products, and medicines.  For many, the choice to save $30,000 and attempt to heal cancer independently seems like the logical approach. However, such a decision would spell financial disaster for the cancer industry. Astonishingly, despite the financial burden, people are more willing to invest in conventional medicine without questioning the cost. It is ironic that individuals would complain about the price of a $19”XÓ  Field trials of genetically-modified Bt eggplant, also known as Bt talong, have officially ended in the Philippines following a significant ruling by the nation's Court of Appeals. In a major win for food sovereignty, the Court determined that Bt talong poses a significant threat to both the environment and human health. As a result, the Court has ordered the immediate destruction of all existing plantings of Bt talong in test fields and has prohibited further propagation. The biotechnology industry has been attempting to introduce genetically-modified crops into the Philippines, claiming that they will improve crop yields and reduce chemical use. However, the Philippines is skeptical of these claims and has taken a strong stance against a technology that has not been proven safe or beneficial. Greenpeace, a non-profit advocacy group, reports that the Court recently issued a 'Write of Kalikasan,' which puts a halt to all field trials of Bt eggplant in the Philippines. The Court has also ordered the biotechnology companies to permanently cease trials, restore the land that has been destroyed, and protect the environment. The ruling states that the field trials involve altering the genetic traits of a living element of the ecosystem and disrupting the natural balance. Therefore, the Court has deemed them unsafe for human health and the environment. The Philippines is far ahead of the United States in adopting the precautionary principle and protecting its people and food supply from a corporate takeover. This decision by the Filipino justice system aligns with common sense - genetically-modified organisms spread their traits throughout the ecosystem, contaminating other crops, and have no place in agriculture. Unfortunately, the United States lacks such common sense, as corporate greed and corruption prioritize profits over people. Greenpeace Southeast Asia Sustainable Agriculture Campaigner Daniel Ocampo commended the Court of Appeals for fulfilling its role as a protector of constitutional rights. Ocampo emphasized that the decision reflects flaws and gaps in the current regulatory process for genetically-modified organisms like Bt eggplant, which pose unknown long-term consequences and lack established safety measures.”Xl
  Many Americans are unaware of the concept of "staged" when it comes to politics. The common belief is that members of Congress and the President have a genuine love for America, its values, the Constitution, and the Founding Fathers. This perception stems from the assumption that these individuals, often privileged and educated at prestigious Ivy League schools, have worked their way up from humble beginnings in local government to positions of power and influence and therefore have the country's best interests at heart. Conspiracy theories, on the other hand, are typically associated with individuals who are considered eccentric or radical, those who may have indulged in excessive drug use during the 1960s and now believe that they are constantly under surveillance by a nefarious government intent on arresting them for treason. Conspiracy theories are often linked to anarchism or fears of a dystopian future reminiscent of George Orwell's novel, "1984." Such paranoia usually pertains to those who suspect that the government had a hand in orchestrating events like the Sandy Hook tragedy in order to push forward stringent gun control measures. These individuals fear that if the country's debt becomes overwhelming, citizens will rise up and storm Washington, armed with firearms that were not actually used in mass shootings.   The term "staged" refers to something that is deliberately contrived to create a specific impression. It can also refer to a planned sequence of events. Therefore, a staged government shutdown would be considered a conspiracy theory, suggesting that the government pretends to shut down for ulterior motives, similar to the methods employed by gangsters, the Mafia, or Wall Street elites. However, discussing the possibility of a staged government shutdown seems absurd when one considers that the government is spending trillions of dollars on a war in a foreign land where no nation has ever successfully conquered the Arab people. How could a government shut down national parks, the ocean, and even publicly accessible parks that they neither own nor manage? Is this all a theatrical performance to achieve some hidden agenda? Will the curtains close and the actors take a bow? Is there a grand finale? Mike Adams of selfnews has extensively covered Acts I, II, and III of what he calls "Obama-Theatre," and he may have accurately predicted what is to come in the ENCORE. There are elements of foreshadowing, drama, and shocking imagery, as reported by CNN. It is truly disheartening to witness such blatant lies exposed so brazenly and directly.

  Massage May Provide More Effective Relief for Low Back Pain Than Medication, Study Finds  A recent study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests that massage therapy may be a more effective treatment for low back pain than traditional interventions such as medication, bed rest, or exercise, according to a report by Healthday. The investigation, conducted by the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, involved 400 patients with low back pain, the majority of whom were middle-aged, Caucasian, and female. The study found that patients who received a series of relaxation or structural massage were better able to work and be active compared to those who received traditional medical care, such as pain pills, muscle relaxants, or physical therapy.  The study randomly divided participants into three groups: structural massage, relaxation massage, and traditional care. Patients in the massage groups received one hour of therapy weekly for 10 weeks. At the end of the 10-week period, over one-third of the patients who received massage therapy reported significant improvement or complete elimination of their pain, compared to only one in 25 patients who received traditional care. Additionally, patients in the massage groups were twice as likely to have spent fewer days in bed rest, used fewer pain pills, and engaged in more activity than those in the traditional care group.  Lead author Daniel Cherkin was surprised to find that structural massage did not prove to be superior to relaxation massage in relieving pain. Structural massage involves manipulating specific back pain-related muscles and ligaments, while relaxation massage, also known as Swedish massage, induces body-wide relaxation. The beneficial effects of the massage were not only experienced during the therapy period but also lingered even after the therapy ended. The massage groups continued to display improved function six months after the study began. However, no significant differences were found among the three groups at the one-year mark.  While the exact mechanism of action for easing back pain through massage therapy remains uncertain, the researchers have offered several theories. One suggestion is that massage therapy stimulates tissue locally or produces a general central nervous system response. Another theory is that simply spending time in a relaxing environment and feeling cared for may be responsible for the improvement. However, it is important to note that the study suggests rather than proves the benefit of massage for back pain. Some members of the American medical community not associated with the research have expressed skepticism about the suggested benefits. Nevertheless, the study's authors believe that the results are significant. Cherkin characterizes the findings as "pretty strong."”Xe  New research published in the August 1 issue of Cancer suggests that men diagnosed with prostate cancer often make hasty treatment decisions based on inaccurate beliefs about the disease. The study, which involved in-depth interviews with 20 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients, found that 19 of them made their treatment choices partly based on the experiences of friends or relatives who had the same condition.  Dr. Thomas D. Denberg, the lead author of the study, emphasized that patients should not compare their own cancer experience to that of others. Just because a particular treatment worked for someone else does not mean it will be effective for everyone. Despite understanding that prostate cancer typically progresses slowly, 12 of the patients in the study wanted immediate treatment, with eight of them favoring surgery.  The decisions were also influenced by misconceptions such as the belief that a cure was guaranteed if the tumor was confined to the prostate, or that the chance of being cured remained high even if the tumor spread beyond the prostate. It was observed that those who chose surgery rejected other treatment options, while those who opted for radiation therapy preferred a specific method called seeding over external radiation due to perceived efficacy and potential side effects.  The authors of the study are urging men to take their time when making treatment decisions and to educate themselves about the disease in order to avoid common misperceptions. In addition, proponents of alternative cancer treatments suggest that men explore safe and natural options such as getting vitamin D from sunlight, consuming green tea, and incorporating minerals like selenium and zinc into their diets. Recent findings also indicate that pomegranate juice can significantly slow the growth of prostate cancer tumors.  In conclusion, the study highlights the need for men diagnosed with prostate cancer to approach their treatment decisions with caution and to seek accurate information about the disease. Rushing into treatment based on misconceptions or the experiences of others may not lead to the best outcomes.”X¹	  Study Finds Minor Diet Change Can Help Prevent Middle-Age Spread  Middle-age-spread is a real issue for both men and women who enter their 40s. As the metabolism slows down and muscle mass is reduced, it becomes increasingly difficult for the body to burn fat and stay fit. Middle age is far from a breezy walk in the park for most people. Under these stressful circumstances, some turn to food or alcohol for comfort, both of which tend to show around the waist. However, a new study published in the journal BMJ offers hope for those trying to fight the dreaded middle-age spread.  The BMJ study, the largest of its kind so far, involved more than 124,000 middle-aged and older people who self-reported their weight and diet over a span of 24 years. After adjusting for smoking and fitness activities, the researchers discovered that people who consumed more flavonoid-rich foods maintained their weight better or even lost a few pounds.  Flavonoids are natural compounds found in plants and play important roles. They are responsible for proper communication between plant cells and create attractive colors for bees and butterflies, aiding in pollination. Some flavonoid-rich foods include strawberries, bananas, grapes, pears, onions, prunes, peppers, green tea, chocolate, and wine. It appears that flavonoids may prevent unwanted weight gain in humans.  While most adults between 18 and 49 tend to gain one or two pounds every year, those who followed a flavonoid-rich diet in the study gained an average of 0.16 to 0.23 fewer pounds every four years. The flavonoids that showed the best results in relation to weight gain were anthocyanin, found in strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, grapes, radishes, and blackcurrants. Flavonoid polymers found in apples and green tea, as well as flavonols commonly found in tea and onions, also showed promising results.  Although the results of the study may not seem significant to those seeking rapid weight loss, they are extremely promising for individuals concerned about middle-age spread. For them, it was outstanding news that something as simple as eating a handful of their favorite berries can help maintain their weight throughout their 40s.  The study published in BMJ was only observational, but the authors had more in mind than just the weight of the participants. Currently, most Americans do not even consume one cup of fruit or two cups of vegetables per day. By demonstrating that certain fruits like berries”X
  Mercury, a highly toxic substance, continues to be used openly in the modern world, despite its well-known detrimental effects. It has the ability to cause permanent brain damage in children, harm unborn babies, and inflict kidney damage in adults. Yet, mercury remains one of the most overlooked toxic substances today. The pollution levels caused by mercury are of great concern, particularly the most dangerous form called methyl mercury. This form wreaks havoc on the human immune system, altering enzymes and damaging the nervous system, which in turn affects coordination and senses such as touch, sight, and taste.  There are various sources of toxic mercury pollution, including the incineration of coal, broken thermometers, medical waste, and metal processing. Gold mines, where mercury is used as an extracting agent, also contribute to mercury pollution. These environmental sources contaminate water sources, leading to the accumulation of mercury in the food chain of aquatic life. As a result, some fish species are now heavily contaminated with mercury. To make matters worse, this toxin is packaged and sold to the public in various forms.  One disheartening application of mercury is its use in dental amalgams. These mercury fillings, which have been a common practice in the dental industry for over three decades, are inserted into a person's teeth as a quick solution for cavities. Despite the availability of alternative options, many people still choose to have their teeth filled with mercury. Once inserted, these fillings become a time-release poison, gradually leaking into the bloodstream and causing harm to the kidneys and nervous system.  However, there is hope that the damage caused by mercury can be reversed or protected against. Research conducted at the University of Rjasthan in India suggests that Spirulina fusiformis, a type of blue-green cyanobacteria, can protect kidneys from the toxic effects of mercury and even reverse existing damage. The kidneys, being the main site of deposition of inorganic mercury, are particularly vulnerable to mercury toxicity. In the study, Swiss albino mice were divided into four groups. One group received a control solution of sodium chloride, while the second group was given a dose of mercury chloride solution. The third group was given mercury chloride and treated with oral Spirulina fusiformis, and the fourth group received the spirulina 10 days prior to being poisoned with mercury chloride. The spirulina treatment was continued for 30 days after the mercury chloride poisoning. The researchers assessed various activities of the mice's kidneys on specific days after treatment, focusing on alkaline phosphatase (”X(
  CIA Agents Conducted Fake Vaccination Scheme to Gather DNA for Intelligence Operation  In a startling revelation, The Guardian has uncovered evidence of a fake vaccination campaign orchestrated by CIA agents in Abbottabad, the town where Osama bin Laden's family was suspected to be hiding. The purpose of this scheme was to collect DNA samples from innocent civilians in order to identify the whereabouts of bin Laden himself. This is the first time a major news outlet has exposed the use of vaccines as tools of warfare, highlighting that vaccination programs are not always solely for public health reasons, but can also serve a nefarious agenda of targeted killings, as was the case with bin Laden.  The question arises: how could extracting DNA from civilians assist the CIA in locating bin Laden's family? The answer lies in the fact that the agency already possessed DNA samples from bin Laden's deceased sister, who had passed away in Boston in 2010. Armed with this initial DNA sample, the CIA could easily determine genetic connections to locate their desired target. This covert method of DNA harvesting during vaccination campaigns demonstrates that the practice can be carried out without the knowledge or consent of the recipients.  This is not the first instance of the U.S. government engaging in such unethical practices. In 2007, it openly admitted to collecting the DNA of newborn babies, maintaining a comprehensive "DNA database" of nearly all infants. The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 made it mandatory for hospitals to extract DNA information from newborns' blood samples, which is subsequently retained by the government, all without parental consent. This alarming procedure is conducted discreetly, without raising any alarms or concerns among parents, who are generally unaware that their child's genetic information is being stored by the government.  The recent revelation of the fake vaccination operation takes this violation of medical ethics and human rights to an even greater extreme. Not only did the CIA employ a doctor named Shakil Afridi to spearhead the campaign, thus exploiting the public's trust in medical professionals, but they also deliberately targeted a poverty-stricken area to create the appearance of authenticity. The town was inundated with vaccination posters, enticing residents to participate in the program. This flagrant disregard for medical ethics and human rights laws is an egregious violation of international law.  The exposure of this fake vaccination scheme sheds light on the alarming use of vaccines as weapons of war. It serves as a stark reminder that vaccination programs can be manipulated for covert intelligence operations, with grave implications for innocent civilians who unknowingly become pawns in these strategies. The consequences of such actions extend beyond”XÌ	  Lead Poisoning: A Widespread Crisis in America  The shocking reports of children being poisoned by lead-contaminated water in Flint, Michigan have captivated the nation's attention, and for good reason. However, what many may not realize is that the story of Flint is not an isolated incident. Children all across the country are being exposed to toxic levels of lead on a daily basis, surpassing even those in Flint. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that lead attacks the brain and central nervous system, leading to coma, convulsions, and even death. While severe cases like these are rare in the United States, it is important not to be complacent. Even low levels of lead exposure can hinder the brain development of fetuses and children, resulting in reduced IQ, behavioral changes, and decreased educational attainment.  Flint has become the face of a man-made crisis, as the city declared in a press release last December. However, the problem of lead poisoning extends far beyond the borders of Flint. In Pennsylvania, for instance, an estimated 8.5 percent of children tested had hazardous levels of lead in their blood. Several other cities in the United States have higher concentrations of lead than Flint.  "In light of the Flint debacle, we wanted people to understand that water is not the only thing that's poisoning children," said Elyse Pivnick, director of environmental health for Isles, Inc. "Most people think the lead problem was solved when we took lead out of gasoline and new homes in the 1970s, but that's not true."  This issue is not limited to Pennsylvania either. In New Jersey, communities such as Irvington, East Orange, Trenton, Newark, Paterson, Plainfield, Jersey City, Elizabeth, Atlantic City, New Brunswick, and Passaic and Cumberland counties have high concentrations of lead, according to NJ.com. In fact, a 2014 report from the New Jersey Department of Health revealed that eleven cities and two counties in the state had a greater percentage of children with elevated lead levels than children in Flint did in 2015. Furthermore, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that over 40 percent of states that provided lead test results in 2014 had higher rates of lead poisoning in children compared to Flint.  Lead poisoning is not solely caused by tainted water. In fact, unlike in Flint, most cases of lead poisoning stem from exposure to air and household products. Many homes built before the 1978 ban on lead paint still have”X_
  Hypothyroidism has become one of the fastest-growing health conditions in the United States, with symptoms including lethargy, depression, and weight gain. Recent reports suggest that thyroid problems may affect 15-30% of the population. To heal the thyroid, natural compounds that support the hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenals, and thyroid are recommended. It is estimated that 80% of hypothyroid cases in the US are autoimmune conditions, but doctors often fail to test for thyroid antibodies, leading to misdiagnosis. In the medical system, both autoimmune conditions and sluggish thyroids are treated with synthetic T4, which is why doctors do not prioritize testing for antibodies. However, it is crucial to understand the underlying cause - whether it is a sluggish thyroid, liver, pituitary gland, elevated sex hormones, or an autoimmune condition - for effective treatment from a natural health perspective.  The body operates through a series of feedback loops, with the hypothalamus serving as a major chemical sensory region. This region constantly monitors the blood for sufficient thyroid hormone levels. When necessary, the hypothalamus sends chemical signals to the pituitary gland, which responds by releasing varying amounts of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to direct the thyroid gland to produce and secrete thyroid hormone (T4). Additionally, the pituitary gland signals the adrenals to secrete cortisol in response to low blood sugar or stress.  Iodine is crucial for the production of thyroid hormones, and a deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism. Although subclinical iodine deficiencies are common in western culture and contribute to hypothyroidism, L-Tyrosine, an essential amino acid, plays a key role in the production of thyroid hormones. Zinc and copper are also important for healthy thyroid function. Low zinc levels compromise T3 production while also playing a role in immune modulation, potentially reducing thyroid antibody levels. Copper stimulates the thyroid and protects against excessive thyroxine in the blood. It also regulates blood calcium levels, which are necessary for mineral absorption and cell membrane permeability. Furthermore, a chromium deficiency can disrupt blood sugar balance, which can overtax the HPA Axis and impact the HPT axis and thyroid function. Therefore, nutrient support to stabilize blood sugar and adrenal function is crucial for maintaining good thyroid health. However, individuals with hypothyroidism taking synthetic thyroid hormone should avoid taking chromium picolinate within four hours of their medication, as it can interfere with levothyroxine absorption.

  Obama Administration's Attempt to Regulate the Internet Sparks Controversy  In a controversial move, the Obama Administration has set its sights on regulating the Internet, despite its failure to create a functional health insurance exchange website. On February 26, a group of three unelected bureaucrats voted to reclassify the Internet as a "public utility," granting the federal government the authority to regulate it more effectively. This decision has sparked concerns over the potential infringement of free speech and the loss of innovation.  Under the new regulations, internet service providers such as Comcast and Verizon will be required to provide services "in the public interest." This vague term has raised questions about the extent of government control over the Internet. The reclassification was approved by the Federal Communications Commission's two Democrat members and its Democrat chairman, while the two Republican members opposed it.  Critics argue that the regulations are unnecessary, as there is no evidence of any systemic harm to consumers that would warrant such a drastic measure. Republican Ajit Pai, a member of the FCC, has called the rules a "solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist." He expressed his concerns that the regulations could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the Internet.  The FCC has faced legal challenges in the past regarding similar neutrality rules. A 2014 ruling by the Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals significantly limited the FCC's authority in this area. It is uncertain how the court will view the new rules, but it is expected that major telecom companies will challenge them.  Despite the controversy surrounding the new regulations, the public remains largely unaware of the details and implications of net neutrality. Media reports suggest that grassroots support for the regulations is high, although many are not aware of the actual content of the rules.  Critics have also raised concerns over President Obama's involvement in an issue that is supposed to be handled independently by the FCC. Some argue that the President's interference compromises the integrity of the commission. Chairman Wheeler, who was responsible for overseeing the decision, has faced significant criticism and pressure throughout the process.  The debate over net neutrality is far from over, and it remains to be seen how the regulations will be implemented and enforced. As the Internet continues to play an increasingly central role in our lives, the question of how it should be regulated is likely to remain a contentious and complex issue.”X|	  Lavender, a beloved herb with a variety of uses, has long been cherished for its sedative, antiseptic, and insect-repelling properties. Not only is lavender a valuable addition to any herb garden, but it can also be utilized in the culinary arts. For those suffering from seasonal coughs and sore throats, lavender may offer relief. With several different species available, such as English lavender (lavandula angustifolia), L. vera, L. spica, and French lavender (Lavandula dentata), each boasting its own unique qualities, lavender is a versatile plant.  One popular remedy for coughs involves creating a homemade cough syrup using lavender flowers and raw honey. However, it is important to note that honey should not be given to children under the age of one, so this remedy is best reserved for older children and adults. To make the syrup, combine a cup of honey with two tablespoons of lavender flowers and allow the mixture to sit for two days. Then, strain the honey into a glass jar. When experiencing severe coughing, take a teaspoon or two of the lavender honey mixture.  Another way to combat coughs and colds is by using lavender essential oil. By adding the oil to a vaporizer, individuals can benefit from its soothing properties. Additionally, lavender oil can be effective in treating respiratory issues such as throat infections, flu, tonsillitis, laryngitis, and sinus congestion. For direct application, a few drops of lavender oil can be rubbed onto the chest, neck, or back, either undiluted or mixed with a carrier oil like sweet almond oil. Inhaling the vapors from a basin of boiling water infused with 2-4 drops of lavender oil can also provide relief for headaches or congestion. Furthermore, adding 6-8 drops of therapeutic grade lavender essential oil to bath water can help alleviate muscle pain and fatigue. However, it is important to note that pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid using lavender essential oil, as is the case with many other essential oils.  Lavender tea is another popular method for relieving headaches, fatigue, and stress. Simply pour 250ml (1 cup) of boiling water over 2 fresh lavender sprays or 2-4 teaspoons of lavender flowers (removed from the stems), allow it to steep for five minutes, strain, and sweeten with raw honey if desired.  For those seeking a natural mouthwash, lavender water can provide a refreshing option. Boil 2 cups of lavender flowers in”•      X

The study, published in the August issue of the journal Atherosclerosis, involved a small human trial that examined 10 diabetics and 10 healthy control subjects over a three-month period. The diabetics were given fresh-squeezed pomegranate juice made from handpicked fruit.  At the conclusion of the study, researchers discovered that the juice did not have an impact on blood sugar levels, cholesterol, or triglycerides. However, it did significantly reduce serum lipid peroxide levels by 56 percent and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels by 28 percent. TBARS is a measure of the oxidation levels of LDL cholesterol, which is associated with the development of atherosclerosis and heart disease.  Based on these findings, the study's authors concluded that consuming pomegranate juice did not worsen diabetic parameters but instead had anti-oxidative effects on serum and macrophages, potentially contributing to the prevention of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients.  Lead researcher Professor Michael Aviram expressed surprise at the fact that the sugars in pomegranate juice did not negatively affect diabetes parameters, such as blood sugar, unlike sugars found in other fruits. Aviram explained that in most juices, sugars are present in harmful forms. However, in pomegranate juice, the sugars are attached to unique antioxidants, which actually protect against atherosclerosis.  Mike Adams, the author of How to Halt Diabetes in 25 Days, highlighted the significance of the study's findings, stating that not all sugars have the same effect on the body, contrary to what the processed food industry often claims. Adams emphasized that natural fruit sugars are much healthier than processed, refined sugars, even if they have similar statistics on nutrition labels. He also noted the emerging status of pomegranate juice as a natural medicine with remarkable properties, suggesting that if it were a drug, pharmaceutical companies would be touting it as a breakthrough.  The positive effects of pomegranate juice on heart health, prostate cancer, and arthritis have led to a surge in its retail sales. In the UK alone, sales of pomegranate juice have increased by 300 percent since the beginning of 2005.”X:
  Tweet  Thirty-nine medical, health, and seniors organizations are calling on Congress to put an end to the advertising of prescription drugs to consumers, according to Commercial Alert and the National Women's Health Network. Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert, stated that prescription drug ads are dishonest and dangerous, as they highlight the benefits while downplaying the risks. Ruskin also referenced a warning from Robert A. Schoellhorn, former chairman of Abbott Laboratories, who expressed concerns about the potential harm caused by direct advertising to consumers. Amy Allina, program director of the National Women's Health Network, emphasized that history has shown that regulation of direct-to-consumer ads is inadequate to protect consumers, citing the example of hormone therapy campaigns that exposed women to breast cancer and heart disease risks.

Lead researcher Martin Krkosek, from the University of Alberta, stated that the impact is so severe that the viability of the wild salmon populations is threatened. Krkosek further explained that the probability of extinction is 100 percent, and the only question is how long it will take.  The study compared the population numbers of different groups of salmon from 1970 to the present, depending on whether they had been exposed to aquaculture salmon farms or not. By utilizing a computer model to analyze population change over time, the researchers were able to demonstrate that exposure to fish farms severely depressed the growth of wild salmon populations. This decline is primarily attributed to sea lice, a parasite that typically infects adult salmon in the open ocean. While adult fish can carry the lice without suffering serious harm, juvenile fish are highly vulnerable to infection and often become seriously ill or die as a result.  Alexandra Morton, the director of the Salmon Coast Field Station and a co-author of the study, explained that salmon farming disrupts a natural law by confining adult salmon in large open nets just offshore. In the natural system, the youngest salmon are not exposed to sea lice because the adult salmon carrying the parasite are located offshore. However, fish farms create a deadly collision between vulnerable young salmon and sea lice. Morton emphasized that the young wild salmon lack the necessary defenses to survive this encounter.  The study found that young wild salmon are exposed to sea lice when they swim past salmon farms on their way from rivers to the open sea. Unless measures are taken to prevent the exposure of young fish to sea lice, such as relocating fish farms away from the paths of wild fish, the researchers concluded that wild salmon will be extinct in the Broughton Archipelago within eight to ten years.”Xó  Illegal genetically modified (GM) wheat is not the only transgenic crop causing surprise in the commercial market. Over the past few years, a long-abandoned type of GM flax known as FP967 has been found in at least 30 countries, significantly impacting the Canadian flax market, which supplies most of the world's flax. The GM Contamination Register reveals that the first discoveries of unapproved FP967 were made in Germany in late 2009. Since then, the same illegal GM flax has been found in Austria, Romania, Sweden, Cyprus, Finland, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia, France, Greece, and Switzerland, among other European countries where the crop was distributed. FP967, initially developed by the publicly-funded Crop Development Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in the late 1980s, was later named Triffid and intended for commercial use. However, concerns about the crop's safety from the European export market prevented Triffid from being produced and sold commercially. By 2001, Triffid was officially de-registered and all known stocks of the seed were believed to have been destroyed. However, Triffid has continued to appear in flax stocks more than a decade later, raising doubts about the integrity of the global supply of flax. This discovery highlights the potential lasting damage that even test runs of GM crops can cause to the food supply. In a 2006 interview, Ernie Hoffert, manager of Reimers Seed Co., warned that there can be no coexistence between pharmaceutical crops and conventional agriculture, as they can disrupt local economies and markets. Hoffert's concerns were proven true when GM flax contamination was discovered in Europe three years later. Despite efforts by the Canadian government and biotechnology groups to contain the contamination and revive the Canadian flax market, it appears that the damage has already been done and may be irreversible. Lucy Sharratt, Coordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network, explained in a 2010 press release that the costs of GE contamination are already being borne by taxpayers and will continue to recur. In light of this, consumers, particularly those in Europe, are advised to choose certified organic and non-GMO varieties of flax seed and oil that have been tested and verified by their manufacturers.”XÇ	  Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) who underwent hypnotherapy sessions experienced a decrease in symptoms and an improvement in their overall quality of life, according to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Nursing. The research, conducted by Dr. Graeme D Smith from the University of Edinburgh, examined 75 patients with IBS before and after they participated in four to five treatment sessions over three months. The study found that women were primarily concerned with quality of life issues such as diet and energy, while men had higher levels of anxiety and depression and were more worried about their physical role.  The study included 20 men and 55 women who reported significant improvements in both physical and emotional symptoms related to IBS after undergoing hypnotherapy. Participants experienced a 30% improvement in emotional quality of life and a 25% improvement in energy levels. Mental health improved by 21%, sleep by 18%, physical health by 16%, and diet by 14%. Social and physical roles also improved by 20% and 18%, respectively. Additionally, anxiety levels decreased by 12% and depression levels decreased by 4%. Men, who initially showed higher levels of anxiety and depression, reported greater improvements than women. Participants also reported a 5% reduction in abdominal pain and a 4% reduction in abdominal bloating.  Dr. Smith, from the University's School of Health (Nursing Studies), emphasized the significant impact of IBS on individuals' physical, emotional, social, and economic well-being. IBS symptoms include altered bowel habits, abdominal pain, bloating, lethargy, sleep problems, and indigestion. Anxiety and psychosocial issues are also common and can negatively affect quality of life.  The study involved hypnotherapy sessions that focused on visualizing gut symptoms and utilizing relaxation techniques. Patients were taught self-hypnosis and provided with audio tapes to reinforce the effects of the hypnotherapy at home. Questionnaires and diary cards were used to gather data before and after treatment.  Dr. Smith noted that the study participants were representative of those typically seen in gastroenterology clinics, where up to 50% of referrals are for IBS. Traditional treatments for IBS are often unsatisfactory, and the study highlights the effectiveness of hypnotherapy in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. It also underscores the valuable role that complementary therapies can play in modern healthcare.”X
  Acupressure, a traditional technique of Chinese medicine, has been gaining popularity in the western world in recent years. While acupuncture is more well-known, acupressure has been used for centuries as a natural treatment for various diseases. The underlying theory behind acupressure is the existence of an invisible force or energy called qi, which is believed to have healing power. This practice involves applying pressure to specific points, known as acupoints or meridians, that are connected to the body's glands. By applying pressure to these points, the flow of qi is increased, promoting normal circulation throughout the body.  One of the unique advantages of acupressure is that it can be self-applied, offering a quick and effective way to relieve various disorders. Regular treatment, including self-treatment, can enhance its effectiveness. The wellness benefits of acupressure are numerous. It helps create a sense of well-being and provides relief from stress and tiredness. It also aids in the healing of injuries, improves blood circulation, releases muscle tension, and reduces back pain.  Acupressure has been reported to alleviate a range of diseases and disorders, including diabetes, epilepsy, bronchitis, heart problems, digestive problems, and allergies. It has also been found effective in relieving eye strain, sinus problems, arthritis, muscle aches, ulcer pain, menstrual cramps, nausea, constipation, and indigestion. During pregnancy, acupressure can assist in inducing pain-free labor and has been used as an alternative to painkillers for minor surgeries. Additionally, it has been utilized to reduce swelling caused by water retention in the lower body. By massaging specific acupoints on the legs, feet, and ankles, swelling can be relieved by eliminating dampness and strengthening the spleen and kidneys, which play a crucial role in maintaining the body's fluid balance.  While anecdotal evidence suggests that using tools like a "porcupine ball" or other devices with pointed nubs can lessen swelling and provide relief, further study is needed to determine their efficacy. Different techniques of pressure are employed based on the specific needs of a patient's disorder, ranging from firm pressure to more aggressive muscle kneading.  It is important to note that acupressure, like other Chinese medicine protocols, does not cure diseases directly. Instead, it works by improving the flow of qi in the body, enabling the body to heal itself. It is believed that a disruption in the flow of qi can cause discomfort, so restoring the flow”Xé
  Dozens of chain restaurants are available for dining out, ranging from fast-food establishments with counters for ordering to traditional sit-down table service restaurants. While McDonald's is perhaps the most well-known fast-food chain, numerous others can be found throughout towns and cities across America. According to data from 2012, there were a staggering 263,944 fast food restaurants in the United States, collectively generating revenue of over $100 billion [1]. However, if we set aside factors such as convenience and focus solely on the quality of food being served, where should we eat? Which restaurants offer the least toxic food? At first glance, it might seem like we have a multitude of choices, but this perception is ultimately deceptive. The differences between fast-food restaurants in terms of the presence of toxic ingredients in their food are minimal.   In the first half of the twentieth century up until the 1960s, individuals traveling across America would have encountered numerous diners or mom-and-pop restaurants. These establishments prided themselves on serving regionally authentic recipes that mirrored the dishes people cooked in their own homes. While the restaurant kitchens were more extensive than home kitchens, the food was prepared in a similar fashion and sourced from the same places. Even institutional kitchens, such as those found in hospitals and nursing homes, cooked much of their food from scratch, just as was customary in most American households until the 1960s. However, this began to change in the 1970s when regional factory-sized "kitchens" started producing frozen foods for wholesale distribution to various establishments, including hospitals, nursing homes, schools, military bases, fast-food eateries, and even renowned restaurants. A network of food factories now supplies the majority of fast-food establishments with ready-to-eat or pre-fabricated food that can be defrosted, heated, and served. In some cases, even high-end table-service restaurants may serve factory-produced food alongside dishes prepared by their own chefs.  When dining at chain restaurants, it is essential not to assume that the food served is made on-site. In fact, this can even be the case for some independent restaurants. Food factories utilize assembly line technology reminiscent of automobile factories, churning out massive quantities of food products. The equipment and processes employed in these factories bear no resemblance to home cooking or even the cooking that could be done in a local restaurant. Factory-produced food is manufactured and distributed by several large companies specializing in providing products for all types of restaurants. One such company, Sysco, is the largest manufacturer of prepared food for restaurants”X)  The Obama Administration is facing increasing allegations of corruption, as well as a "culture of intimidation" that permeates every level of government, according to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. This culture, which has been developing over generations as Congress has relinquished its legislative power, is characterized by the dismissive arrogance of President Obama and his top officials. Syndicated columnist Ben Shapiro argues that this culture extends from the White House down to various executive branch agencies, which Obama controls as president. Shapiro highlights Obama's language that suggests targeting enemies and attempts by his officials to label Tea Partiers as economic terrorists. He also points to the IRS scandal, in which conservative groups were unfairly scrutinized during the application process for tax-exempt status. Despite publicly expressing disdain for the scandal and claiming that the IRS should remain non-partisan, it has been revealed that Obama met with a former IRS official and union president just before the agency opened a case on Tea Party groups. This case, along with other examples, demonstrates that Obama resorts to intimidation when he cannot gain political support for his agenda. The power he holds over agencies like the IRS and the Justice Department is a cause for concern, as it allows him to exert a dangerous level of control. The Department of Justice Inspector General's recent report on the "Fast and Furious" scandal further reveals the administration's misconduct and attempts to silence whistleblowers.”X¥
  Jill Hennessy, the health minister of Victoria, Australia, recently made a controversial statement that has outraged parents of vaccine-injured children. Hennessy claimed on Channel 10 Melbourne that there are no risks in vaccinating children. However, even the pro-vaccine health establishment acknowledges that there are risks associated with vaccination, as with any drug. This is evident in the long list of potential adverse reactions found in vaccine package inserts. Hennessy's remarks demonstrate a disregard for science in favor of a political agenda, which is unbecoming of a health minister. Below are several examples of scientifically proven vaccine side effects that Hennessy either seems to be unaware of or is determined to conceal.  Vaccine package inserts and reputable medical literature indicate that vaccines have been linked to serious side effects such as arthritis, blood clots and bleeding, ear infections, fainting (sometimes leading to injury), heart attacks, kidney failure (requiring dialysis), miscarriage, seizures, sepsis, severe allergies (ranging from hives to anaphylactic shock), and even sudden death. Furthermore, various diseases have been associated with vaccination, including chronic allergies (such as asthma and eczema), arthritis, acid reflux, cancer, diabetes (in infants and children), kidney disease, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and a range of neurological and autoimmune conditions.   In the United States, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) has awarded over $1.2 billion in injury compensation. The following is a brief overview of some scientifically accepted vaccine side effects.  One example is the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. A recent article in the Danish Medical Journal reveals that a small subset of women who receive the HPV vaccine experience consistent neurological symptoms that do not correspond with any known disease. The researchers describe these symptoms as being primarily consistent with sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. However, this does not mean that women who do not develop this rare condition are safe. A 2009 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reviewed side effects within the first two years of the HPV vaccine's introduction. The study identified 12,424 adverse effects, ranging from dizziness to autoimmune diseases. Shockingly, there were also 32 reported deaths. The researchers deemed these rates consistent with drug safety studies and comparable to the side effect rates of other vaccines. Diane Harper, whose research played a crucial role in the FDA approval of both HPV vaccines, has publicly stated that the risks of the HPV vaccine outweigh its benefits for women in”X¬	  In a groundbreaking study led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, a common additive found in food and cosmetics has been discovered to hinder the activity of sirtuins, enzymes associated with regulating lifespan in various organisms, including yeast. The study, set to be published on Friday, Dec. 16, in the online journal Public Library of Science (PLoS) Genetics, found that dihydrocoumarin (DHC), a compound naturally found in sweet clover and synthetically produced for use in foods and cosmetics, inhibited the activity of Sir2p and SIRT1, forms of sirtuin found in yeast and humans, respectively.  Enhanced sirtuin activity has been proven to increase longevity in yeast, roundworms, and fruit flies. Conversely, a decrease in sirtuin enzyme has also been linked to a decrease in lifespan in yeast, with reductions of up to 30 percent. Although studies on sirtuins and longevity have not been conducted in humans, there is reason to suspect that sirtuins play a role in the aging process of human cells, making the identification of sirtuin inhibitors significant, according to Martyn Smith, professor of toxicology at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health and principal investigator of the study. The research was funded by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.  DHC is commonly used as a flavoring agent in a wide range of foods, including soft drinks, yogurt, and muffins, and is also used as a fragrance in cosmetics, lotions, and soaps. It can be found in concentrations as high as 100 parts per million in gelatins, puddings, and frozen dairy products. Although it is still a long way from the laboratory to humans, the study's findings suggest that individuals are exposed to chemicals in their diet and environment that obstruct an important enzyme involved in longevity, according to Smith.  Significantly, there are five forms of sirtuins found in yeast and seven forms found in humans. Jasper Rine, professor of genetics at UC Berkeley's Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and co-author of the study, believes that DHC would likely inhibit at least some of the functions of certain forms of sirtuins. The researchers from UC Berkeley collaborated with Dr. Eric Verdin, associate director and senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, which is affiliated with UC San Francisco. Verdin, who is also a professor of”XÀ   Experts are calling for an increase in the daily recommended intake of vitamin D, arguing that current levels are insufficient to provide protection against cancer. Vitamin D is a crucial nutrient that the body produces when exposed to sunlight. However, in regions with limited sunlight, such as northern latitudes, many people struggle to synthesize enough vitamin D. This issue is particularly prevalent among individuals with darker skin. Few foods naturally contain high levels of vitamin D, with fish oil and fortified products like milk serving as the most common dietary sources. The United States and Canada currently recommend a daily intake of 200 IU of vitamin D. However, experts in the field of vitamin D and cancer are warning that this amount is far too low. The Canadian Cancer Society recently suggested that individuals with light skin should take a 1,000 IU vitamin D supplement daily during the fall and winter months, while those with dark skin or who consistently keep their skin covered outdoors should take a supplement year-round. "We're recommending 1,000 IU daily because the current evidence suggests this amount will help reduce cancer risk with the least potential for harm," explained Heather Logan, director of the society's Cancer Control Policy. Vitamin D researcher Joan Lappe praised the Canadian Cancer Society's recommendation, stating, "They're right out in the lead there on changing the recommendations." Lappe led a recent study that found women taking 1,100 IU of vitamin D per day had a 60 percent lower risk of developing cancer compared to those taking a placebo. Excluding women who developed cancer within the first year of the four-year study, the risk reduction associated with vitamin D was 77 percent. In a paper published in the "American Journal of Clinical Nutrition," a group of vitamin D experts proposed an upper daily limit of 10,000 IU for vitamin D exposure, diverging from the current more cautious government guidelines.”X…	  In the wake of public backlash against "sanctuary city" policies, where local officials work against federal immigration authorities to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, other cities are now seeking to implement similar measures. Despite criticism from the American people, the Obama administration has failed to enforce existing immigration laws, providing room for these policies to flourish. Activists in Iowa are now pushing for Iowa City and Cedar Rapids to become sanctuaries for illegal immigrants, following the recent incident in San Francisco where an undocumented migrant shot and killed an American woman. Francisco Sanchez, the migrant responsible for the crime, had been deported multiple times and was in custody as recently as March, but was released by San Francisco authorities due to the city's policy. Supporters argue that these policies allow immigrants to fully participate in the community without fear. Meanwhile, in Cedar Rapids, the movement for sanctuary cities is being driven by advocates who believe that the working class can only triumph over the ruling class if they unite. These advocates, like Marlon Pierre-Antoine, a Haitian-American leading the movement, are part of SocialistAction, a group that advocates for a borderless world and immediate citizenship for all immigrants. If Iowa City and Cedar Rapids were to defy federal law and become sanctuary cities, they would join the ranks of over 200 other U.S. cities that have made similar choices. Critics of sanctuary city policies argue that these communities are placing their residents at a greater risk of criminal activity from undocumented individuals. Iowa holds significance for opponents of these policies because it is home to early election primaries, and allowing more immigrants, legal and illegal, to settle there undisturbed could eventually shift the demographics in favor of progressive socialists. Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the Centers for Immigration Studies, argues that any jurisdiction that provides drivers licenses, welfare benefits, public housing, or municipal ID cards could also be considered a sanctuary, pushing the number of sanctuary cities to over 300. In response to the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, lawmakers are considering measures such as cutting federal funding to sanctuary cities and implementing mandatory jail terms for repeat illegal border crossers.”Xd  Work Stress Increases Risk of Type 2 Diabetes, German Study Finds  A new study conducted by scientists at the German Research Center for Environmental Health has found a strong link between work-related stress and the development of type 2 diabetes. The study, published in the scientific journal Psychosomatic Medicine, concludes that individuals under high levels of pressure at work, with limited control over their activities, are 45 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to those experiencing lower stress levels.  Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body is unable to properly use insulin, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels. While some individuals can manage the condition through weight loss and a healthy diet, others suffer from it for a lifetime. This research suggests that simply reducing stress at work can have significant benefits in preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes.  The study, known as MONICA/KORA, analyzed data from over 5,300 employed individuals aged 29 to 66 years old. Participants had no known history of diabetes at the start of the study. After an average follow-up period of 13 years, nearly 300 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The researchers found that high levels of stress in individuals who had little control over their work situations increased the risk of developing the condition.  The study also revealed that approximately one in five people suffered from high levels of mental stress at work. These individuals ranked the demands placed on them as "very high." The researchers highlighted the importance of preventive measures to address work-related stress and reduce the risk of common diseases like diabetes.  The German Research Center for Environmental Health is collaborating with the German Center for Diabetes Research to develop new approaches for diagnosing, treating, and preventing diabetes. Stress has been shown to have a range of other health complications, both physical and mental. It is crucial to address work-related stress to improve overall well-being and reduce the incidence of chronic diseases in developed countries.”X£  Chronic exposure to the toxic chemical arsenic, commonly found in rice, fruit juices, and even some municipal water supplies, has been linked to the oxidation of blood and the development of disease-causing inflammation, according to numerous scientific studies. These studies have shown that arsenic obstructs the activity of antioxidants in the body, including the important antioxidant glutathione. A recent study published in Environmental Health Perspectives further supports these findings by revealing that exposure to arsenic depletes glutathione, the body's primary intracellular antioxidant, and induces oxidative stress. The study involved 378 participants who consumed varying levels of arsenic-laced water, and the results showed that higher exposure to arsenic led to more damage. The study also examined the impact of arsenic exposure on cysteine, a semi-essential amino acid, and found similar negative associations. Previous studies published in the International Journal of Molecular Medicine and Toxicological Sciences have also demonstrated the depletion of glutathione due to arsenic exposure. Glutathione plays a crucial role in detoxification and overall health, as it recycles antioxidants and supports immune function, organ function, and nutrient transfer among cells. However, healthy levels of glutathione are becoming increasingly rare due to factors such as poor diet, stress, and exposure to toxins like arsenic.”X&  More and more major supermarkets are jumping on the natural foods bandwagon, with Kroger leading the charge with its Nature's Market section in over 1,300 of its 2,500 stores nationwide. The competition for market share in the natural foods industry is driving prices down, which is good news for consumers. "Used to be this was all very faddish," said Gregg Proctor, head of natural foods for Kroger's central division. "Not anymore. We're constantly adding new items because if we don't, our competition will." According to the Nutrition Business Journal, natural food sales grew eight percent in 2010, compared to less than one percent growth in the overall U.S. food market. Kroger in Cincinnati has seen its natural food sales double in the last four years, highlighting the race among the nation's largest grocers to meet the demand for natural foods. Many supermarkets are increasing promotions and offerings, even launching their own natural food brands. This competition is not only benefiting consumers in terms of selection and abundance, but also in terms of price. "Make no mistake, there is a definite price differential," said Meg Major, editor-in-chief of Progressive Grocer. "But as the natural foods segment continues to grow, it has not only raised awareness but also affordability." The shift towards natural foods reflects a larger cultural trend of people seeking less processed and preservative-filled options. However, there is a hurdle in this category: education. The distinction between organic and natural foods can be confusing, as natural foods are not regulated like organic foods. Organic foods are subject to strict rules and guidelines, ensuring that farmers and manufacturers comply with regulations. In contrast, natural foods rely on manufacturers to define the term. Ultimately, it is up to consumers to educate themselves about labels and make informed choices at the supermarket. Nevertheless, the increasing demand for natural foods is encouraging to see, as it prompts large retailers to offer healthier alternatives and expand their selection.”XÒ	  'The Law of Attraction' Debunked: Action Required for Success  In recent years, the concept of the Law of Attraction has gained significant popularity, thanks to the book 'The Secret.' However, experts argue that this widely accepted interpretation of the Law of Attraction is flawed. Contrary to what many believe, simply wishing for things and hoping for them to magically appear does not yield real-world results. Instead, a combination of intention and action is crucial for achieving success.  This Friday, in an exclusive audio broadcast on TalkNetwork.com, I will reveal the true secrets to taking action and getting results. Using the strategies that I will share, I have successfully built the most diverse alternative media network in the world. This network includes a search engine, radio network, news content network, news aggregation websites, private science lab, and multiple reference sites. It is important to note that I did not achieve these outcomes by merely sitting in a room and imagining them. Rather, I combined intention with the power of dedicated action.  The broadcast, titled 'The Law of Attraction FAILS without action,' will air this Friday at 11am Pacific / 2pm Eastern on the Health Ranger Report at TalkNetwork.com. Listeners can tune in using any PC, Mac, Android, iPhone, or iPad device. (A new streaming connection has just been rolled out.)

It is clear that action is the missing ingredient in the Law of Attraction. Join me this Friday to learn how to combine intention with action and unlock true success.”X¸	  Discover Safe and Effective Natural Remedies for Acne  If you're tired of relying on potentially harmful mainstream acne medications, why not explore the benefits of natural remedies? In just two weeks or less, you could see significant improvement or even complete eradication of your acne, along with related issues like redness and light scarring.   Lemon juice, tea-tree oil, and aqueous cream are among the noteworthy solutions. Before bedtime, start by cleansing your face thoroughly. Then, apply lemon juice, which may cause a slight itching sensation for a short period. Follow this with a small amount of pure tea-tree oil and finish with a generous layer of aqueous cream. For optimal results, lie on your back while allowing the cream to work its magic overnight. Alternatively, you can rub it in after approximately 30 minutes. Enhance the effectiveness of this and other remedies by incorporating three kiwifruits and around 3/4 cup of raw carrots into your daily diet.  Another natural remedy involves a combination of oatmeal, vinegar, raspberries, egg, and sea salt. Start by mashing raspberries and mixing them with sea salt and oatmeal. Add vinegar and an egg to create a paste-like mixture. Before applying it to your face, exfoliate using a scrub or loofah. Steam your face, then apply the mixture generously. After approximately 30 minutes, rinse with cold water.  Honey and cinnamon also offer promising results. Create a paste by combining three tablespoons of honey with one tablespoon of cinnamon. Apply it to the affected area using circular motions and leave it on overnight. In the morning, wash it off to reveal smoother skin.  For an astringent solution, mix lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide, willow bark powder, echinacea, and goldenseal together. Apply the mixture using cotton balls or tissue, allowing it to dry on your face. Once dry, follow up with aloe vera. Repeat this process twice daily after cleansing your face.  Fresh basil leaves can also work wonders. Simmer a small handful of these leaves in two cups of water for 15 minutes, then chill the mixture in the refrigerator. Apply it to troubled areas or your entire face using a cotton ball. This remedy not only helps eliminate acne but can also minimize existing scarring.  Egg white is another simple yet effective solution. Apply a small amount to pimples and leave it on overnight, or use it as a mask for your entire face. Notice the difference when you wake up the next morning â€“ reduced”Xü	  1994 Trial Could Have Prevented Disastrous TGN1412 Experiment  In the wake of the recent TGN1412 drug trial in London, which left six volunteers hospitalized with life-threatening side effects, new information has emerged that suggests this tragedy could have been avoided. Terry Hamblin, a retired professor of medicine from Southampton, conducted a trial in 1994 using an antibody similar to the one in TGN1412, and his findings were never made public.  Hamblin's trial, like the TGN1412 trial, resulted in rapid and serious side effects in previously healthy volunteers. However, Hamblin's trial was conducted differently - the experimental drug was administered slowly over several hours, allowing for proper identification and intervention in case of negative side effects. Unfortunately, Hamblin did not believe medical journals would be interested in publishing the trial information and therefore it was never made public.  Furthermore, Hamblin was not required to inform regulators of the side effects observed in his study. This lack of transparency is concerning, as it raises questions about the accountability and oversight of these early-phase drug trials. If Hamblin's trial had been made public, it is possible that the design of the TGN1412 trial could have been altered to be less dangerous for the volunteers.  TeGenero, the company behind TGN1412, has faced criticism for its trial design, which some experts argue did not adhere to the standard practice of administering experimental drugs slowly and in low doses. The revelations from Hamblin's trial further highlight the importance of following established research practices to ensure the safety of participants.  In June 2006, Hamblin's trial information was presented to a UK commission aiming to increase transparency in phase-one human drug trials. Professor Gordon Duff, the commission's chair, has made several recommendations to the pharmaceutical industry to prevent future disasters like the TGN1412 trial. While the industry has accepted many of Duff's recommendations, including publishing trial results for licensed drugs and drugs with safety concerns, they have rejected the call for public disclosure of all phase-one trial results.  Critics argue that the pharmaceutical industry prioritizes intellectual property over human lives, as drug trials continue to be shrouded in secrecy. The tragedy of the TGN1412 trial underscores the urgent need for greater transparency and accountability in early-phase drug trials to ensure the safety and well-being of volunteers.”XQ
  Sleep: A Crucial Component of Health and Cancer Prevention  Sleep plays a fundamental role in maintaining our overall well-being. Recent studies suggest that a lack of sufficient sleep not only affects our immune system but also increases the risk of various types of cancer. The interaction between the immune and hormonal systems appears to be a critical factor in preventing cancer cells from proliferating beyond the control of our immune system.  Two hormones, melatonin and cortisol, have emerged as key players in the prevention of cancer. When these hormones are balanced, the risk of developing cancer and the rate of its progression can be significantly reduced. Surprisingly, it has been estimated that up to 88 percent of cancer patients suffer from sleep disorders, indicating a strong connection between sleep and cancer.  Sleep apnea, a condition characterized by interrupted breathing during sleep, is more prevalent among cancer patients than in the general population. Additionally, cancer patients are twice as likely to experience insomnia. Restless nights due to sleep disorders can impair a patient's immune system, making them more susceptible to the disease. Researchers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have found a striking correlation between sleep apnea and death from cancer. In fact, nearly 30 percent of cancer patients reporting fatigue were diagnosed with sleep apnea, while 60 percent were diagnosed with insomnia.  Studies conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of Louisville School of Medicine have shed light on the influence of a patient's circadian rhythm on cancer progression. The circadian rhythm, which regulates our metabolism, physiology, and hormonal production, may also play a role in the development of cancer. Alterations in this rhythm can lead to decreased production of melatonin, a hormone that possesses powerful antioxidant properties. A disrupted circadian rhythm may render the cell's DNA more susceptible to cancer-causing mutations. Furthermore, melatonin plays a crucial role in inhibiting the production of estrogen by the ovaries. In individuals with breast and ovarian tumors, estrogen promotes the continuous division of cancerous cells.  Another hormone, cortisol, also plays a significant role in cancer prevention. Cortisol levels are typically highest in the morning and gradually decline throughout the day. This hormone regulates the activity of the immune system, including natural-killer cells that destroy cancer cells. The Stanford study revealed that individuals at high risk for breast cancer often exhibit an altered cortisol rhythm. This suggests that those with a disrupted cortisol cycle may be more susceptible to cancer. In fact, women with breast cancer who had a disrupted cortisol cycle, with peak levels occurring in the afternoon instead of at dawn, experienced”Xç
  UPDATE: All the petitions from San Diego County were turned in and accounted for, but the actual number of signatures cannot currently be verified. A major grassroots effort to overturn California's recently passed SB277 forced vaccination bill came to an end yesterday as volunteers reached the Monday deadline to submit signatures they had collected over a three-month period. To immediately halt the mandatory vaccine bill and qualify it for the November 2016 ballot, volunteers needed to gather 366,000 signatures.  As the September 28 deadline neared, leaders of the @SB277Referendum appeared excited and optimistic about reaching their goal. Libertarian Tim Donnelly, the initiative's leader, posted photos on social media of boxes stacked high and loaded with signed petitions. On September 16, referendum leaders estimated that they had received at least 300,000 signatures, and two weeks later there was buzz that they had reached close to half a million signatures. Leaders also announced a generous donation of $150,000 from an in-state donor, bringing their total funds raised to over $300,000.  However, once volunteers began submitting their signatures, things started to go awry. Petitioners reported huge discrepancies in various counties, with some claiming they only received credit for a third of what was turned in to referendum managers Donnelly and Lauren Stephens, who were responsible for submitting the petitions to validation companies. While the total number of signatures has not yet been confirmed, it is clear that the number of signatures validated so far is much lower than previously estimated.  Here are some estimates of the discrepancies: San Diego County submitted eight boxes of signatures but only received one in return; Orange County is missing 6,000 signatures; San Bernardino County is missing 8,000 signatures; Sacramento County is missing 15,000-20,000 signatures. While the final signature count is still unknown, only an estimated 100,000 of the potential half a million signatures have been accounted for, meaning hundreds of thousands of signatures are missing.  The missing signatures have led some volunteers to claim that the referendum was sabotaged, possibly from within. Organizers have filed a request for an investigation with the California Secretary of State. The large discrepancies in signature counts have caused panic among volunteers, with some pointing fingers at referendum leaders. Some volunteers allege that they handed in many more signatures to Stephens than she turned in to the validation companies. Stephens denies discarding any petitions but has not explained where the signatures have gone. This is peculiar, considering that two weeks earlier she publicly announced they were expecting at least 300,000 signatures”XZ	  Harvard University, often perceived as the epitome of elitism, has shed light on a contentious issue that has long been debated by the progressive elite: the effectiveness of gun control policies in reducing violent crime. Surprisingly, this revelation hasn't received widespread attention from the mainstream media. The study, titled "Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide?", examined intentional deaths in continental Europe and compared them to the United States. Contrary to popular belief, the study found that stricter gun control measures do not necessarily lead to lower death rates or a decrease in violent crime.  In fact, the study highlights that the notion of "more guns mean more deaths and fewer guns mean fewer deaths" is flawed. The researchers discovered that countries with higher rates of gun ownership, such as Finland, actually experienced lower murder rates. Similarly, Norway, with the highest household gun ownership rate in Western Europe, had the lowest murder rate in the region. This contradicts the assumption that fewer guns result in reduced violence.  When the study shifted its focus to intentional deaths between the United States and continental Europe, it uncovered significant findings. Despite being often labeled as the most violent nation by gun control advocates, the United States actually ranked 7th in murders, trailing behind countries like Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine. In terms of suicides, America ranked a mere 22nd.  The study's author, referencing their findings, asserts that those who claim more guns lead to more death and violence must substantiate their claims with evidence from numerous nations. They argue that proponents of stringent gun control policies should be able to demonstrate significant reductions in criminal violence or suicide rates in countries with such measures in place. However, after a thorough examination of multiple nations worldwide, the study found no observable correlations supporting these assertions.  In a society where the debate on gun control often leads to heated discussions and deep divisions, the Harvard study provides a fresh perspective grounded in empirical evidence. It challenges the prevailing narrative propagated by the progressive elitist class, forcing them to reconsider their assumptions and engage in a more nuanced conversation on the subject.”X
  Eating a small amount of broccoli each day could have a significant impact on reducing the risk of ulcers and stomach cancer, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. In a study published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research, scientists conducted an experiment in Japan, assigning 50 participants to consume either 2.5 ounces of broccoli sprouts or 2.5 ounces of alfalfa sprouts daily for two months. The researchers analyzed stool samples of the participants before and after the study to measure HpSA, a chemical known to indicate infection with the Heliobacter pylori bacterium. This bacterium causes chronic inflammation of the stomach lining, which significantly increases the risk of stomach cancer and ulcers.   In the United States, about 25 to 30 percent of people have this bacterium in their stomachs, but 80 percent of them show no symptoms of infection. In Japan, infection rates are much higher, reaching nearly 90 percent due to overcrowding. The researchers found that the group consuming broccoli sprouts experienced a 40 percent decrease in HpSA levels by the end of the experiment. However, when they stopped eating the sprouts, HpSA levels returned to pre-study levels after two months. On the other hand, consumption of alfalfa sprouts had no effect on HpSA levels.  According to one of the researchers, Fahey, "H. pylori is a known carcinogen. The fact that we were able to reduce the effects of an infectious agent that is also a carcinogen gives us hope that if someone were to eat broccoli sprouts or broccoli regularly, it would reduce levels of H. pylori and, over a period of many years, reduce the chance that they would get that cancer. It is not proven, but the results are highly suggestive."   Additionally, the researchers found that inflammation levels in the stomach were reduced with the consumption of broccoli sprouts. Fahey mentioned that "the fact that the levels of infection and inflammation were reduced suggests the likelihood of getting gastritis and ulcers and cancer is probably reduced. The evidence is all pointing toward broccoli or broccoli sprouts being able to prevent cancer in humans."   The researchers attribute much of broccoli's protective benefits to its high levels of sulforaphane, a chemical that acts as an antibiotic and stimulates the body to reduce various enzymes with different health benefits. Previous studies have shown that these enzymes protect the skin from sun damage, reduce inflammation, and prevent heart disease.   In a separate experiment, the researchers fed mice infected with H. pyl”X
  In a remarkable turn of events, a 33-year-old father from the United Kingdom has defied medical expectations and overcome terminal bowel cancer without the use of chemotherapy or radiation. David Hibbitt received a devastating diagnosis from his doctors, who predicted that he had just 18 months to live. However, Hibbitt took matters into his own hands and found an unconventional solution to his dire situation: therapeutic doses of cannabis oil. This alternative treatment, which cost him only $75 per month, proved to be a life-saving decision.  Initially, Hibbitt pursued traditional methods of treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, but these interventions proved unsuccessful. Faced with this discouraging outcome, he took it upon himself to research his condition online. It was during this process that he stumbled upon information about the potential of cannabis oil as a viable treatment option. Encouraged by these findings, he decided to give it a try, and the results were nothing short of astonishing.  Medical scans conducted in January revealed that Hibbitt is now completely cancer-free, thanks to the concentrated cannabis oil he obtained from a local dealer. Initially skeptical due to the stigma surrounding the plant and its illegal status in many places, Hibbitt carefully weighed his options before deciding that cannabis was worth a shot, particularly considering the harm he had already experienced as a result of chemotherapy. He reached out to a local manufacturer of high-potency cannabis oil, commonly known as "Phoenix Tears," and was able to obtain the necessary amount for his treatment. The positive outcome is evident in his restored health, as he celebrates his clean bill of health.  While one might expect such a miraculous recovery to garner international attention and prompt health officials to reconsider the prohibition of cannabis for medical use, the reality is quite different. The medical establishment is seemingly threatened by natural cancer treatments like cannabis oil, which are not only effective but also significantly cheaper than conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation.  Hibbitt's inspiring journey serves as a reminder that alternative options exist for those facing life-threatening illnesses. As he shares his story, he hopes to raise awareness about the potential of cannabis oil and encourage others to consider alternative treatments. It is a testament to the power of personal research and the potential of unconventional therapies to challenge the status quo in the fight against cancer.”X5   Radio host Patrick Timpone, the mastermind behind One Radio Network, has officially joined the selfnews Radio Network.

However, the mainstream media often fails to address the potential drawbacks of assisted reproduction technologies (ART). These high-tech methods have been increasingly linked to an elevated risk of congenital malformations and various diseases in the future. Nonetheless, a recent systematic review conducted by New Zealand scientists, published in The Cochrane Library, suggests that a natural therapy could be a solution for male fertility issues. The study reveals that men who take antioxidant supplements have a significantly higher chance of impregnating their partners through natural means, as opposed to those who do not take such supplements. Subfertility, which affects approximately one in 20 men, refers to less-than-optimal fertility. The researchers in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand highlight the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on cells, particularly sperm cells. This damage is believed to be the cause of reduced sperm counts and, consequently, difficulties in fertilizing eggs. However, the review emphasizes that antioxidants can counteract the damage caused by ROS. The study, which examined 34 trials involving 2,876 couples undergoing assisted reproductive techniques, found that most men in these trials had low sperm counts or low sperm motility. The trials involved the use of various oral antioxidants, including vitamin E, L-carnitine, zinc, and magnesium. The results demonstrated that women were much more likely to become pregnant if their partners took antioxidants compared to those who did not. The trials also showed positive improvements in sperm concentration and motility with antioxidant supplementation. Lead researcher Marian Showell suggests that men should be encouraged to take oral antioxidant supplements to enhance their partners' chances of conceiving, particularly in assisted reproductive programs. However, the research team lacks sufficient data comparing different antioxidants to determine the most effective supplements for aiding male fertility. Dr. Showell emphasizes the need for further research to understand whether any specific antioxidant outperforms others. For additional information, visit http://www.selfnews.com/antioxidants.html.”X.
  Food and Chemical Toxicology (FCT), a prominent scientific journal, recently retracted a research paper authored by the Gilles Eric-Seralini team. This decision came after the paper faced significant criticism from scientists associated with the genetically modified organism (GMO) industry, some of whom held GMO patents. Surprisingly, their potential conflicts of interest were overlooked. The mainstream media unquestioningly accepted these criticisms as scientific truth, without consulting Seralini or his numerous supporters.  Seralini and his team, based at the University of Caen in France, do not have ties to the large corporations that frequently advertise through the mainstream media. Furthermore, hundreds of scientists support their study. However, the voices of GMO proponents received favorable press, leading to the removal of Seralini's study, titled "Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize," by FCT's editor-in-chief, A. Wallace Hayes. Notably, Hayes acknowledged that the study was not fraudulent or inaccurate, but deemed it inconclusive. Genuine scientists criticized this decision, pointing out that peer-reviewed studies often reach inconclusive findings and suggesting the need for further research. Another study that posed harm to Monsanto was also discarded soon after the arrival of former Monsanto scientist Richard E. Goodman as associate editor for biotechnology at FCT. However, this study has since been published in another journal.  In response to the criticisms from GMO proponents reported by the mainstream media, it is important to note several key points. Firstly, the rats used in Seralini's study were the same ones that Monsanto had used in a 90-day trial. These Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats have a life expectancy of 24 to 36 months, making them suitable for a two-year study intended to replicate the lifespan of a human. Additionally, it is true that around 30 percent of SD rats develop cancer symptoms without any test-induced provocations, which aligns with human cancer statistics. In Seralini's study, more SD rats that were fed below the maximum regulatory amounts of Roundup, along with Roundup Ready corn, developed tumors compared to the control group within four to seven months. The exposed rats also had shorter lifespans.  Another criticism raised is the number of rats used in the study. While the short Monsanto study used 20 rats for each group, only 10 urine and serum samples were checked in each group. In contrast, Seralini's study used 10 rats for each group, with urine and serum samples”X
  Bee Deaths Linked to Bayer Pesticide  In a breakthrough discovery, scientists have identified the cause behind the mysterious deaths of bees. Colony Collapse Disorder, which has resulted in significant bee die-offs, has been linked to the pesticide Clothianidin, manufactured by Bayer. This pesticide has been found to be responsible for the loss of bees in Germany and France. While recent bee deaths have been more severe, there have been previous incidents linked to the same and similar products.  The evidence against Bayer is mounting, as a lawsuit in North Dakota is pending for the loss of bees in 1995 due to the use of Imidacloprid, another Bayer pesticide. In 1999, France banned the use of Imidacloprid as a seed dressing for sunflowers after losing one-third of their hives following widespread spraying. The pesticide was also banned for use on corn in 2004. Just recently, France refused to approve Bayer's request to sell Clothianidin.  Both Clothianidin and Imidacloprid belong to a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which are recognized as potent insect neurotoxins, particularly for bees. The Coalition Against Bayer Dangers, based in Germany, has been warning about the risks of neonicotinoids for nearly a decade. A spokesperson for the coalition stated, "This proves without a doubt that the chemicals can come into contact with bees and kill them. These pesticides shouldn't be on the market."  The fact that neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects is not surprising, as they were specifically developed for that purpose. However, Bayer insists that their products are safe for bees when used according to instructions. These instructions involve using a glue to keep the pesticides adhered to the seeds they are used on. Despite this, there are several issues with this approach.  Agribusiness corporations are known to cut corners when it comes to expenses. The glue required for the pesticides costs money, as does the equipment and personnel needed for its application. Furthermore, even with careful pesticide application, it is still likely that some of it will become airborne. The residue left behind by these pesticides can also poison the soil and be passed on to the foods that insects come into contact with.  Interestingly, the manufacturer of these pesticides, Bayer, is also a major pharmaceutical company. This connection between pharmaceuticals and pesticides raises questions and concerns. Bayer is not alone in this dual industry involvement, as many other corporations also profit from both pharmaceuticals and pesticides.”•h     Xè
  New research suggests that free radical damage is a major contributor to both accelerated aging and the development of cancer cells. When cells are exposed to high levels of free radicals without proper signaling processes, they can experience genetic mutations that lead to abnormal replication. Fortunately, nature has provided us with a defense against free radicals in the form of antioxidants. Among the most powerful antioxidants found in nature are a group of polyphenols known as anthocyanins.  Many plants face the constant challenge of direct sunlight and ultraviolet rays throughout the day. To protect themselves, these plants have developed potent antioxidant polyphenols that scavenge free radicals. Anthocyanins, in particular, are highly effective at safeguarding cells. These polyphenols derive their name from their deep blue or purple color, with "cyan" being the Greek word for dark blue. This color is achieved at the cellular level through unique double bond structures. By absorbing blue-green and UV light, these components act as a natural sunscreen, reducing stress on the plant. Additionally, they work as antioxidants, swiftly and effectively scavenging free radicals.  Scientists have identified over 600 variations of anthocyanins naturally occurring in our ecosystem. The most prevalent form is cyaniding-3-glucoside (C3G), which has been shown in human and animal studies to directly impact gene expression. C3G selectively up-regulates genes that offer greater protection while down-regulating genes that cause damage, such as pro-inflammatory mediators.  In our society, many individuals experience chronic inflammation due to various factors including excessive free radical formation, low antioxidant levels, nutritional deficiencies, poor fatty acid balance, elevated toxin exposure, and heightened mental, emotional, physical, and neurological stress. Under inflammatory conditions, certain cells can activate oncogenes, which are responsible for the reproduction of cancer cells. The faster oncogenes form, the more rapidly cancer can grow and spread. However, the body has its own natural defense against cancer in the form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Anthocyanins have been found to suppress the inflammatory conditions that lead to oncogenes, while promoting apoptosis in cancer cells.  When cancer cells first form, they are typically considered "undifferentiated." This means they lack specific functional characteristics, unlike normal liver or skin cells. Studies have shown that C3G can induce the normal differentiation of certain cancers, such as melanoma cells. This is significant because differentiated cancer cells are far less dangerous than undifferentiated ones.  To incorporate more anthocyanins into your diet, consider”X„
  In recent discussions with Matt Monarch, the owner of The Raw Food World and the primary distributor of Adya Clarity, we have addressed the concerns raised regarding the product mentioned in my previous article (http://www.selfnews.com/034005_Adya_Clari...). These concerns encompass issues such as the product's promotion for internal use, labeling discrepancies, and health claims. After thoroughly examining all available information regarding Adya Clarity, Matt Monarch has made a commendable decision to implement three crucial changes in the labeling and marketing of the product, contingent upon his continued marketing of it. It is worth noting that Matt Bakos, the president of Adya, Inc., has also agreed to these conditions.  Firstly, Adya Clarity will no longer be marketed or labeled for internal use unless there is clinical evidence to substantiate its safety for internal consumption. This entails subjecting Adya to comprehensive clinical studies conducted by a reputable organization that can monitor the intake of the product by a group of individuals and assess their levels of iron and aluminum. This testing aims to ensure that there are no instances of overload or toxicity resulting from the product's ingestion. Although such extensive testing is not typically expected for a food item with a long history of traditional use, it is prudent to pursue it for a non-food item such as Adya Clarity. Additionally, I personally suggest including the phrase "Not for internal use" on the product label until its safety for internal consumption is proven.  Secondly, Adya Clarity will be relabeled with a transparent label that accurately discloses the concentration of elements in the product. The new labeling will be designed to provide customers with clear information, eliminating any attempts to minimize or conceal specific elements as currently being done. Furthermore, the "ingredients" section of the label will accurately list sulfuric acid, a key ingredient that is currently omitted, as well as aluminum sulfate in its proper concentration.  Lastly, Adya Clarity's label will undergo Ralph Fucetola's full approval. Ralph Fucetola, known as the "Vitamin Lawyer," specializes in ensuring FDA-compliant product labeling (www.VitaminLawyer.com). The Raw Food World will only sell Adya Clarity once the label is approved by Fucetola, who maintains stringent standards to align with FDA labeling requirements. This collaboration is significant because Fucetola refuses to associate his name with any product label that does not strictly adhere to these requirements.  Additionally, The Raw Food World is honoring refund requests from customers who have purchased Adya”X
  Headline: "Book Exposes Politics Behind Cancer Therapy, Rekindling Controversy Over Banned Treatment"  Thirty-one years ago, a groundbreaking book shed light on the tangled web of politics surrounding cancer therapy. The author, G. Edward Griffin, painted a vivid portrait of a world where a potentially effective cancer control method was suppressed due to the greed of the powerful pharmaceutical industry. Astonishingly, three decades later, little has changed. Griffin's 1974 book, World Without Cancer, remains as relevant and provocative as it was on the day of its publication.  At its core, Griffin's book delves into the story of a potent substance that, despite its potential to aid in the fight against cancer, remains unknown to many cancer patients and even their doctors. This substance is known as vitamin B-17 or Laetrile, a naturally occurring compound that has been banned for cancer control in the United States.  Griffin's journey into the world of vitamin therapy for cancer began during a fishing trip with San Francisco physician John Richardson, as he revealed in a recent telephone interview. Dr. Richardson shared his remarkable success in treating cancer patients with vitamin B-17, but his unorthodox approach faced fierce opposition from local medical authorities. These authorities, upon discovering his use of a non-FDA-approved treatment, vehemently opposed his methods.  In a bid to defend his right to administer a treatment that had yielded positive results for numerous patients, Dr. Richardson enlisted Griffin's support. This partnership marked the genesis of World Without Cancer. Griffin, initially ignorant about the intricacies of cancer, embarked on extensive research that led him to a simple yet profound conclusion: natural Laetrile is an effective cancer treatment. Over the years, Griffin claims to have witnessed thousands of individuals benefit from Laetrile therapy.  Moreover, Griffin discovered a crucial link between cancer and a deficiency in vitamin B-17, which is abundantly found in apricot kernels. However, his most disconcerting revelation was that the suppression of Laetrile and its therapeutic potential was rooted in political, rather than scientific, motives. Griffin contends that the 1953 California Report, authored by Dr. Henry Garland and Dr. E. M. McDonald of the California Medical Association's Cancer Advisory Commission, still serves as the primary basis for opposition to vitamin B-17 today.  The report, which dismisses Laetrile as an effective cancer control method, was authored by the same doctors who once denied any connection between smoking and lung cancer. Griffin's book reveals that Garland and McDonald manipulated”X{
  IRS Targeting of Conservative Non-Profits Raises Concerns  The recent revelation that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) engaged in politically-motivated audits of conservative non-profit groups has sparked widespread controversy and concern. The IRS specifically targeted non-profits that taught the Constitution or expressed mild criticism of the federal government, demanding that they disclose the names of their donors and volunteers. This scandal has raised questions about the Obama administration's use of the IRS as a political weapon to silence dissent and threaten political enemies.  According to a draft investigative timeline released by the IRS Office of Inspector General, the agency's Cincinnati-based office responsible for vetting tax-exempt applications began targeting groups with phrases like "Tea Party" or "patriots" in their names for closer scrutiny. This revelation has prompted outrage from both Republicans and Democrats, with Representative Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Committee, stating, "This is obviously disturbing...Americans should take notice that top Obama Administration officials increasingly see themselves as above the law and emboldened by the belief that they don't have to answer to anyone."  While some have attempted to downplay the significance of these actions, documents obtained by The Washington Post reveal that the scheme extended all the way to IRS offices in Washington D.C. This suggests that the targeting of conservative groups was not limited to a local IRS office in Cincinnati, as some have claimed.  Adding to the concerns surrounding the IRS is its impending role as the enforcement arm of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, starting in January 2014. As part of this enforcement, the IRS will require Americans to provide private health insurance status information and ID numbers. Refusal to comply will result in financial penalties, which increase each year until reaching a penalty of $2,085 per family or 2.5% of income, whichever is greater.  The cost of acquiring health insurance mandated by President Obama's healthcare law has also raised alarm. According to estimates from major insurance companies, premiums are projected to rise anywhere from 100% to 400% under Obamacare.  The combination of the IRS scandal and the impending role of the agency in enforcing Obamacare has sparked widespread concern about the government's use of power and its impact on individual freedoms. As investigations continue and more information is uncovered, the American people are left questioning the integrity of their government and the extent to which it can be trusted.”Xâ	  USDA's Wildlife Services Faces Scrutiny for Killing Millions of Animals  In a surprising turn of events, the US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services, an agency entrusted with the preservation and protection of the country's wildlife, has reportedly killed over 4 million animals in 2013. This disheartening statistic, as reported by The Washington Post, highlights the agency's role in exterminating wild animals in service to various entities such as ranches and airports. While the number of animals killed has fluctuated over the years, the figures reached a new high last year.  Among the casualties in fiscal year 2013 were 75,326 coyotes, 866 bobcats, 528 river otters, 3,700 foxes, 12,186 prairie dogs, 973 red-tailed hawks, 419 black bears, and at least three eagles, both golden and bald. It is important to note that it is illegal to kill bald or golden eagles without a permit and a valid reason from the Interior Secretary.  Curiously, despite the USDA maintaining a list of animals killed, there is an alarming lack of data regarding the specific reasons behind each extermination, the methods employed, and the necessity of these actions. Furthermore, there is a dearth of information explaining the errors that have resulted in the unintended mass killing of non-targeted animals. This lack of transparency has led to criticism from two members of Congress, who describe the Wildlife Services as secretive and opaque. Calls for an investigation into the agency's operations are mounting.  In response to these concerns, officials from USDA's Wildlife Services claim that the agency responds to requests from government entities across the nation while strategically addressing human-wildlife conflicts. Spokeswoman Carol Bannerman stated that ranchers and farmers bear half the costs of the agency's animal control efforts, as they perceive these creatures as threats. However, Bannerman failed to provide an explanation for the drastic fluctuations in kill numbers, ranging from as low as 1.5 million in one year to as high as 5 million in the next.  The Washington Post reports that while the agency's primary purpose is to eradicate invasive species from other parts of the world, such as feral hogs, nutria, tegus, and starlings, it also engages in mass killings of native animals solely based on a homeowner's or farmer's perception of a threat.  As the death toll of wildlife continues to rise, critics are demanding a more comprehensive explanation from the USDA's Wildlife Services. They argue that”X‡  Ginger, a common ingredient in many culinary dishes, contains a compound that is significantly more effective than chemotherapy drugs at targeting and killing cancer stem cells, according to a study published in the journal PLoS. The compound, known as 6-shogaol, is produced when ginger roots are dried or cooked. Researchers discovered that 6-shogaol is capable of destroying cancer stem cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed, a stark contrast to traditional chemotherapy treatments that often come with severe side effects due to their impact on healthy cells.   Cancer stem cells are responsible for 90 percent of cancer-related deaths as they possess the ability to differentiate into different types of cells within a tumor. These cells make up less than 1 percent of the total cells in a tumor but are resistant to most chemotherapy drugs. Furthermore, they can replicate indefinitely and spread to other parts of the body, leading to metastasis. The persistence of cancer stem cells also explains why cancer can recur even after successful tumor eradication through chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery.   The researchers found that 6-shogaol targets breast cancer stem cells through various pathways, resulting in reduced expression of surface markers, increased cell death rate, inhibition of tumor formation, induction of programmed cell death, and direct poisoning of cancer stem cells. In comparison, the widely used chemotherapy drug taxol showed limited effectiveness against cancer stem cells in laboratory models. Even at a concentration 10,000 times higher than 6-shogaol, taxol had no effect on the three-dimensional model of cancer tumors, which is considered to be a more accurate representation of real-world tumors.   What makes 6-shogaol particularly promising is that it occurs naturally in a commonly consumed food, making it potentially safer than synthetic chemotherapy drugs. The researchers noted that dietary compounds have a long history of acceptance by the human body and are therefore attractive options for treating diseases. Another food-based chemical, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), has also shown promise in targeting cancer stem cells.”Xm
  The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA), founded by former Graham County Sheriff Richard Mack, has a clear motto: "To seek justice, protect civil liberties, and uphold the Constitution." The organization's mission is to provide sheriffs, peace officers, and public officials with the necessary information and public support to fulfill their duties in accordance with their Oaths of Office. However, the ultimate goal, as Mack explains, is to work towards preserving the American republic before it is too late.  The roots of CSPOA can be traced back to the early 1990s when the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act, commonly known as the "Brady Bill," was passed. This legislation, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, marked the first instance of background checks being required for gun buyers. It also established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is maintained by the FBI.  Mack recalls that when the Brady Bill was implemented, federal authorities provided state, county, and local law enforcement agencies with instructions on how to enforce its provisions. This guidance did not sit well with Mack, who felt it infringed upon the autonomy of these agencies. He recounts a meeting where three federal agents handed out documents from the Department of the Treasury detailing the "orders" for compliance with the Brady Bill. The sheriffs were appalled by this and disagreed with it, but many believed that challenging federal authorities was futile. However, Mack decided to take a different approach and sued his own government. Despite others doubting his chances of success, six other sheriffs from various parts of the country joined the lawsuit. In a surprising turn of events, the case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and they emerged victorious.  According to Mack, constitutional usurpation persists today and, if anything, has worsened. He believes that the nation is currently facing a dire situation, with countless experts suggesting that there is no way to alter its course. However, Mack vehemently disagrees with this sentiment and states that there is something that can be done. He argues that education is key in combating Washington's continuous overreach. To this end, CSPOA is forming the Constitutional Peace Officers Association, which aims to unite all public servants and sheriffs in upholding, defending, protecting, preserving, and obeying the Constitutions of the United States of America.

Mack describes”Xª	  Discounted Dog Treats: A Costly Gamble for Pet Owners  In a recent letter to Heloise, a pet owner shared her strategy of purchasing treats from a Dollar store for a mere dollar, claiming that they are almost as good as the $5 treats from a pet store. Unfortunately, this well-intentioned pet owner may be unknowingly putting her furry friend's health at risk. The age-old saying "you get what you pay for" often rings true when it comes to pet foods and treats, and discounted options are no exception.  Discount stores typically acquire large quantities of soon-to-be outdated or expired goods for a fraction of their original cost, selling them at a significantly reduced price in the hopes of clearing their shelves before the expiration date. Some of these stores also stock up on imported goods that resemble popular brands. This should raise concerns for pet owners, especially when it comes to Chinese imported pet foods and treats. Regardless of the origin, however, these discounted treats offer little in terms of actual nutrition for pets.  Let's consider a hypothetical scenario: a $1 bag of dog treats called Fido's Best Chicken Flavored Natural Dog Treats, containing 20 small pieces weighing 20 ounces. Just as with pet foods, manufacturers are legally allowed to make unverifiable claims on pet treat labels. Therefore, Fido's Best Natural might not actually be the "best" or "natural" option it claims to be. Let's assume the discount store purchased these treats for only $0.50 per bag. If half of the price covers manufacturing labor, packaging, and markup expenses, each 20-ounce bag of treats contains merely $0.25 worth of ingredients.  If the cost of ingredients is only $0.25 for 20 ounces, or approximately 1.2 cents per ounce (around $0.19 per pound), it's evident that these treats provide little in terms of quality nutrition for pets. According to AAFCO regulations, pet treats are considered supplemental to a pet's diet, meaning they do not have to adhere to the same strict labeling or ingredient rules as pet foods. This raises concerns about the quality of ingredients that may be present in these treats.  At a cost of 1.2 cents per ounce for ingredients, it is safe to assume that discount treats are made with the cheapest leftover or subpar imported ingredients. Even if purchased in bulk for $380.00 per ton, these treats would likely still contain the lowest-quality ingredients. In either case, these treats offer no real nutritional”XÕ
  A pair of academics with a globalist perspective are putting forth an idea that was once dismissed as a conspiracy theory, and interestingly enough, they are making their case on the same cable news outlet that previously ridiculed the concept. In an online column for CNN, Andres Martinez, editorial director of Zocalo Public Square and professor of practice at the Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University, and Daniel Kurtz-Phelan, an Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fellow at New America and a former adviser on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's policy planning staff, argue for a merger between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, similar to the European Union.  The two academics propose this idea despite CNN's previous attempt to mock former U.S. Representative Ron Paul, who had mentioned the concept of a North American Union. The recent op-ed by Martinez and Kurtz-Phelan, on behalf of New America, a globalist-centric think tank, argues that the future of the United States lies in North America and not in the Constitution or the American people. They believe that the United States, Canada, and Mexico are connected by a shared economic, environmental, demographic, and cultural destiny.  In recognition of this shared destiny, Martinez and Kurtz-Phelan suggest the establishment of a "North American passport," which would eventually lead to the elimination of U.S. borders in favor of "North American" borders. This idea aligns with initiatives such as "Beyond the Border" that have been in progress for years. They compare this proposed North American passport to the European Union passport, which would allow all North American residents to freely travel, work, invest, learn, and innovate anywhere within North America.  New America describes itself as an organization dedicated to renewing American politics, prosperity, and purpose in the digital age through big ideas, technological innovation, next-generation politics, and creative engagement with broad audiences. Martinez and Kurtz-Phelan argue that previous economic ties through agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement have benefited all three countries and have permanently linked them together. They see traditional boundaries between countries as outdated relics that have no place in the modern era. Sovereignty, to them, is a concept from the Old World.  The academics also emphasize the importance of regional cooperation when it comes to North American energy resources. They believe that these resources should be leveraged through cross-border infrastructure investments and environmental planning. They assert that mineral resources, much like the water flowing down the Colorado River, are not influenced by the lines on a map that separate nation-states”XY
  In Austin, Texas, the issue of water fluoridation has sparked intense debate among doctors, scientists, activists, and community members who oppose the city's long-standing practice of medicating the public without their consent. The city routinely adds hydrofluorosilicic acid, an industrial waste product from the phosphate industry, to its water supply, costing taxpayers over $300,000 annually.  Last week, Austin's Public Utilities Committee, responsible for reviewing matters related to the city's water utility, gathered to discuss a resolution to end water fluoridation. A number of qualified experts spoke out against the practice, highlighting the dangers associated with this industrial chemical. Among the opponents were local dentist Dr. Griffin Cole, environmental scientist Dr. Neil Carman, former candidate for Austin City Council Dr. Laura Pressley, Justin Arman, Executive Director of Texans for Accountable Government (TAG), and Rae Nadler-Olenick, founder of Fluoride-Free Austin, along with her colleague Linda Green.  During the meeting, more than 50 pages of scientific reviews and studies were presented, detailing the adverse health effects of water fluoridation. This wealth of information left committee members visibly perplexed, causing some of them to reevaluate their position on fluoride and question their ethical compass.  Attempting to defend the city's fluoridation practices were Ruth Burazer, Assistant Director of Austin Water Utility, and Janet Pichette, Chief Epidemiologist for Austin's Health and Human Services Department. They maintained that water fluoridation has no negative health effects as long as the fluoride levels remain "optimal." However, Pichette's testimony was somewhat uncomfortable to witness, as she struggled to articulate her thoughts, her face betraying signs of fear and confusion as she addressed the committee's concerns. Pichette and Burazer contended that Austin's fluoride levels are in "full compliance" with the Public Health Department, despite recently being lowered from 1.2 parts per million to a maximum of 0.7 ppm, a level that still poses health risks, especially for infants and young children.  Pichette insisted that fluoridation is necessary to prevent tooth decay in children, a claim disputed by local dentist Dr. Griffin Cole. During his presentation, Dr. Cole argued that tooth decay has decreased worldwide, not just in areas with water fluoridation. He stated, "There has never been a single randomized controlled study that demonstrates the effectiveness of water fluoridation." Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged in 2012”XØ	  Smokers often underestimate the impact of processed, chemical-filled foods, drinks, and personal care products on their bodies. These substances can put them in an acidic state, leading smokers to rely on nicotine for temporary relief. When smokers finally kick the habit, stress becomes the number one trigger that sends them back to smoking. The overwhelming pressure of stress often leads new non-smokers to say, "I could really use a cigarette right now." What many people don't realize, including non-smokers with unhealthy eating habits, is that toxic food, drinks, and skincare products can contribute to depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and overall poor health.  Certain combinations of food additives, such as MSG and aspartame, can send a person's central nervous system into chaos, resulting in migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, and more. Additionally, GMO foods can harm your immune system by killing off beneficial gut bacteria faster than pesticides and insecticides. When combined with bleached foods and fluoridated water, these factors can create a negative state of mind and an inability to cope with stress.  When overwhelmed, most new non-smokers may turn to sharing, bumming, or taking a drag from someone else's cigarette at a bar or party, leading to a relapse within weeks or even days. To avoid relapse, it's important to understand that cancer can only survive in an acidic environment, meaning a low-pH body, blood, and tissues. Cancer cells die when they receive oxygen and become alkaline. Substances like sodium benzoate, canola oil, and GMO pesticide-laden corn, soy, and sugar beets deprive cells of oxygen, choking mitochondria and mutating genes.  Common chemicals found in personal care products and cosmetics, such as phthalates, parabens, and sodium lauryl sulfate, have been linked to cancer. Even everyday items like lipstick may contain lead, and conventional chicken may contain arsenic. Hormones can be found in milk, and vaccines may contain MSG. Keeping up with this information can be overwhelming, but what's even more overwhelming is chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and the misguided advice often offered by Western Medicine.   To give your cells the oxygen they need, it's recommended to consume organic vegetables, organic fruit, and real spring water. Kale and hemp seed oil are power boosters, while organic spinach, chard, and aloe are also beneficial. Amino acids, especially branched-chains, should be considered. Baking soda can help raise alkalinity, and E”XÏ
  Glucosamine-like Supplement Shows Promise in Treating Autoimmune Diseases  A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Irvine has found that a dietary supplement similar to glucosamine may be able to suppress the damaging autoimmune response seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The researchers, led by Dr. Michael Demetriou from the UC Irvine Center for Immunology, discovered that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) inhibited the growth and function of abnormal T-cells that wrongly attack specific tissues in the body, such as the brain myelin in MS and insulin-producing cells in diabetes. The findings of the study were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.  According to Dr. Demetriou, this discovery has significant implications for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. He stated, "This finding shows the potential of using a dietary supplement to help treat autoimmune diseases. Most importantly, we understand how this sugar-based supplement inhibits the cells that attack the body, making metabolic therapy a rational approach to prevent or treat these debilitating diseases."  The study focused on how metabolic therapy with GlcNAc and related nutrients can modify the growth and autoimmune activity of T-cells. T-cells, like other cells, have proteins on their surface that are modified with complex sugars. Changes in these sugars have been associated with T-cell hyperactivity and autoimmune diseases. The researchers found that GlcNAc prevented this hyperactivity and autoimmune response by increasing sugar modifications to the T-cell proteins. This therapy normalized T-cell function and prevented the development of paralysis in MS and high blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes.  The researchers' findings build on previous studies that have shown the potential of GlcNAc in humans. One clinical study reported that 8 out of 12 children with treatment-resistant autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease significantly improved after two years of treatment with GlcNAc, with no significant adverse side effects.  Dr. Demetriou emphasized the potential of metabolic therapy using dietary supplements like GlcNAc as a treatment for autoimmune diseases, saying, "Excitement for this treatment strategy stems from the novel mechanism for affecting T-cell function and autoimmunity and the availability and simplicity of its use. However, additional studies in humans will be required to assess the full potential of this therapeutic approach."  Autoimmune diseases such as MS and type 1 diabetes result from complex interactions between inherited genetic risk and environmental exposure. MS leads to neurological dysfunction, while uncontrolled blood glucose in type 1 diabetes can cause damage”Xþ  In a recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers have found that taking statin drugs to lower cholesterol levels may increase the risk of memory loss. However, some mainstream media outlets, which are often funded by pharmaceutical companies, are reporting the opposite in order to deceive the public into continuing to use these potentially harmful drugs. The study, titled "Statin Therapy and Risk of Acute Memory Impairment," compared the health outcomes of nearly 500,000 statin users to non-users. The researchers also analyzed the effects of non-statin lipid-lowering drugs and no treatment at all on memory loss. The study discovered that memory loss rates were similar among patients taking statins and those taking non-statin lipid-lowering drugs, leading some news outlets to claim that both drug classes are safe and effective. However, non-users of either drug had better memory outcomes than both groups, suggesting that both types of cholesterol-lowering drugs may contribute to memory loss. The study concludes that either all lipid-lowering drugs cause memory loss or the association is due to detection bias rather than a causal connection. Mainstream media outlets, including TIME, CBS News, and Business Standard, have chosen to focus on the detection bias explanation and have published headlines declaring that statins are not responsible for memory loss. These outlets have distorted the study's findings, which raises concerns about their dependence on advertising revenue from pharmaceutical companies that sell statins and lipid-lowering drugs. If these media outlets were to provide an honest assessment of the situation - acknowledging that statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs may indeed have adverse effects on the brain - their sponsors, such as GlaxoSmithKline and Merck & Co., might withdraw their financial support. Consequently, the general public, particularly those who rely on American media, is left with a false impression that statins and similar drugs are completely safe and effective. This manipulative tactic is reminiscent of the approach used by vaccine proponents to dissuade people from questioning the safety of vaccines, as they claim that all vaccines are unquestionably safe and effective, regardless of scientific evidence.”XÅ	  New Study Links Non-Stick Cookware Chemical to Increase in Cholesterol Levels  In a recent study published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, researchers found a strong correlation between high levels of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFOA) and an increase in both total cholesterol and LDL "bad" cholesterol. PFOA is a synthetic chemical commonly used on the surfaces of cookware to create a non-stick coating. The study focused on 12,000 children who were exposed to PFOA through their local water supply, which was contaminated with the chemical.  However, it is important to note that this study does not prove a direct link between non-stick cookware and cholesterol. Instead, it suggests a possible connection that should be further investigated. PFOA is not only found on cooking pans but also on various cooking surfaces used in electric consumer food prep appliances such as sandwich toasters, griddles, and popular devices like George Foreman Grills. Additionally, most restaurants use non-stick cooking surfaces to prepare a wide range of menu items, including omelets, pancakes, and pasta sauces.  Avoiding PFOA exposure is nearly impossible unless individuals prepare all their own food at home and carefully select the food prep devices they use. Even cookware brands that claim to be safe, such as Swiss Diamond pans, are found to contain PFOA chemicals. While some consumers may be unaware of the dangers associated with PFOA, it is crucial to be cautious when using non-stick cookware. The use of forks or metal spatulas to stir food in these pans can scrape off microscopic bits of PFOA chemicals that can then be ingested.  To minimize exposure to PFOA, it is recommended to avoid using non-stick cookware altogether. Instead, consumers are advised to opt for stainless steel cookware with copper plating on the bottom, as this helps distribute heat and prevents burning. Alternatively, individuals can incorporate more raw foods and superfood smoothies into their diets, eliminating the need for cooking altogether. It is important to note that cooking food at high temperatures, regardless of the type of cookware used, can create carcinogens in the food. Steaming or boiling are considered the safest methods of cooking, while frying, broiling, and grilling can result in the formation of cancer-causing chemicals in the food itself.  Further research is needed to fully understand the potential risks associated with PFOA exposure and its impact on cholesterol levels.”X*
  Federal Appeals Court Rules Against Syngenta in Genetically Modified Corn Dispute  In a recent ruling, a federal appeals court has determined that Syngenta, a biotech giant, cannot compel a grain elevator firm to store a strain of genetically modified corn. Syngenta had attempted to use a century-old warehouse law to force Bunge, the elevator company, to accept the genetically modified (GM) corn. This ruling could have broader implications for other producers of GM seeds and crops who have tried to use similar strategies against grain elevators that have refused to harbor crops with altered transgenic traits, according to experts.  The controversy began in 2011 when Bunge operators declined to accept Syngenta Seeds' Agrisure Viptera variety of corn. The elevator operators informed farmers growing the genetically modified strain that they could not accept it due to legal and regulatory requirements in major export destinations. At the time, the strain had not yet been approved by the Chinese government.  In response, Syngenta filed a lawsuit against Bunge, accusing the company of violating the U.S. Warehouse Act of 1916, which mandates fair treatment of depositors by elevators. Syngenta argued that farmers who grew Viptera corn had to ship their crops to other elevators and find alternative sources of corn, impacting Syngenta's reputation and market share. However, the judges on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Syngenta's suit, stating that the agricultural giant lacked a legal basis for bringing the case against Bunge.  While farmers affected by the appeals court decision still have the right to sue Bunge, the ruling currently prevents other GMO seed manufacturers, such as Monsanto, Dow, and DuPont, from pursuing similar litigation tactics, according to Drew Kershen, an agricultural biotechnology law professor at the University of Oklahoma. Kershen explained that the ruling effectively denies these companies a "private cause of action" against grain elevators.  Even if a farmer affected by the ruling decides to sue Bunge over the rejection of Viptera corn, the chances of a successful outcome remain uncertain. Kershen noted that it is unclear whether an elevator's obligation to be "fair and reasonable" prohibits it from rejecting certain strains and breeds of corn. The lack of legal precedent, USDA interpretation, or clarity surrounding these terms complicates the matter.  Critics of biotechnology have viewed the dispute between Syngenta and Bunge as a warning regarding the potential impact of GM corn and other crops on export markets. George”X
  Do Acid-Suppressive Medications Increase the Risk of Deadly Pneumonia?  If you have been diagnosed with a peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or occasionally experience heartburn, chances are your doctor or pharmacist has recommended drugs like Prevacid, Prilosec, or Nexium. These medications belong to a class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are known for their potency in inhibiting stomach acid secretion. However, recent evidence suggests that these drugs may have troublesome and even serious side effects. A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) suggests that PPIs may disrupt the body's natural balance and potentially lead to deadly pneumonia.  Currently, PPIs are among the best-selling drugs worldwide and are commonly prescribed to hospitalized patients for the prevention or treatment of heartburn. However, the JAMA article reveals that between 40 percent and 70 percent of hospitalized patients receive some form of these drugs, even for indications that lack supporting data and research. Shoshana J. Herzig, M.D., of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, led a study that sheds light on the dangers associated with this practice. The research suggests that hospitalized patients who are given acid-suppressive medications face a significantly increased risk of developing pneumonia.  Dr. Herzig and her colleagues analyzed data from patients admitted to a large, urban, academic medical center between January 2004 and December 2007. The study included patients who were at least 18 years old, hospitalized for three or more days, and not in such critical condition that they required admission to the intensive care unit. Acid-suppressive medication use was defined as any prescription for a proton pump inhibitor or another type of acid-blocking drug known as a histamine2 receptor antagonist (used less frequently than PPIs).  The researchers examined data from 63,878 hospital admissions and found that 52 percent of these patients were given acid-suppressing medication. Nearly 90 percent of those on these drugs received them within 48 hours of admission. Among those who received these medications, 27,236 (83 percent) were prescribed PPIs, while 7,548 (23 percent) were given histamine2 receptor antagonists. Some patients were even prescribed both types of stomach acid-fighting drugs.  Initially, the researchers observed that 2,219 patients (3.5 percent) developed hospital-acquired pneumonia, and this risk was significantly higher in the group exposed to acid”Xq
  Asthma, a chronic illness that affects approximately 17 million individuals in the United States, has become the leading cause of such conditions in children. Despite the availability of various medications, the number of asthma cases in the US has increased by 2.5 million over the past five years. While doctors may have reservations about alternative treatment options, such as acupuncture and breathing exercises, these methods do not carry the harmful side effects associated with medications.   Asthma is characterized by breathing difficulties, coughing, and wheezing, often caused by the constriction of bronchial tubes. Severe asthma attacks can even prove fatal. The exact cause behind this constriction is unknown, but triggers can include respiratory infections, exercise, and emotional disturbances.   Alternative therapies, such as bodywork, acupuncture, and biofeedback, hold promise in managing asthma. Bodywork techniques, such as Rolfing and osteopathic manipulation, aim to address the restrictive patterns in muscles and nerves commonly found in individuals with chronic asthma. Acupuncture, on the other hand, offers personalized treatments that have been shown to decrease the frequency of asthma attacks and improve breathing. Biofeedback, which teaches individuals how to control their heart rate, can also be beneficial in managing asthma by reducing stress, a common trigger for attacks.   Breathing exercises, known as the Buteyko Breathing Technique, were discovered by Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko, MD, in 1952. Dr. Buteyko posited that over-breathing contributes significantly to the development of asthma and other respiratory difficulties. To help asthma sufferers breathe more easily, he developed a system of shallow-breathing exercises. Shallow breathing raises carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which may help dilate smooth muscles in the airways. A large study found that the Buteyko Breathing Technique reduced asthma symptoms and decreased reliance on inhalers.   Stress can also trigger asthma attacks, making stress management an integral part of alternative asthma treatment. Relaxing activities like yoga, guided imagery, and progressive muscle relaxation have been shown to aid in managing asthma by reducing stress. However, it is worth noting that deep breathing exercises may trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals.   Considering that people spend 90% of their lives indoors, it is crucial for asthmatics to minimize respiratory irritants in their homes. Dust, smoke, and mold are common irritants that tend to hide in carpets, drapes, mattresses, and furniture. Frequent cleaning and replacing these items with hypoall”X­  Food Activist Group Sues USDA Agency Over Lack of Transparency  A prominent food activist organization has recently filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), accusing one of its agencies of violating provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by failing to provide requested documents. The Center for Food Safety has taken legal action against the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), claiming that the agency has ignored FOIA requests for records related to genetically engineered crops by unlawfully delaying responses and withholding public disclosure of information.  According to Sustainable Pulse, a leading source for sustainable agriculture news, the lawsuit argues that APHIS has neglected to provide timely responses to at least 29 separate FOIA requests or appeals. Furthermore, the suit alleges that out of these cases, the agency has failed to provide a final response to ten requests and two appeals. The Center for Food Safety is seeking a court order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, demanding that APHIS promptly furnish the requested information and cease its practice of untimely responses to future FOIA requests for genetically modified organism (GMO)-related data.  The violation of public access to information is a central concern for the Center for Food Safety. Cristina Stella, a staff attorney for the organization, explained, "APHIS has a track record of irresponsible and inadequate regulation of GE crops. In the absence of thorough government oversight, public access to information about these crops becomes all the more critical. This lawsuit is necessary to stop APHIS from continuing to ignore its duty to provide the public with information that affects farmers, communities, and the environment."  Sustainable Pulse reports that GMO crops have been associated with agronomic and environmental damage, such as the contamination of traditional and organic crops through transgenic means. Moreover, studies have indicated that GMOs can have adverse health effects. These concerns highlight the urgency of the lawsuit and the need for greater transparency in the regulation of genetically engineered crops.”Xw	  Attending a dinner party can be a delightful experience, filled with good company and delicious food. However, for one in five Americans, the aftermath of a satisfying meal often includes the discomfort of heartburn. Many individuals turn to antacids for relief, but recent research suggests that these indigestion medications may be linked to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.  Researchers at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Disease in Bonn analyzed insurance data on individuals over the age of 75 and found a strong association between heartburn medication, specifically proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and neurological damage that can lead to dementia. The study revealed that patients who used PPIs at least once every three months were 44% more likely to experience this type of damage.  Although the exact reason behind this connection remains unknown, researchers speculate that PPIs may cause vitamin B12 deficiencies, which can manifest symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. This theory is supported by a previous study conducted in 2013, which showed that mice treated with PPIs developed high levels of amyloid plaques, a key factor in Alzheimer's onset.  It is worth noting that antacids, another common treatment for heartburn, also have their downsides. While they differ from PPIs, they can lead to constipation, diarrhea, bloating, and potentially worsen the condition. Additionally, these medications can actually increase stomach acid levels once the treatment is completed.  Despite the compelling evidence, Dr. Laura Phipps of Alzheimer's Research UK cautions against jumping to conclusions. She points out that other factors may have contributed to the results and emphasizes the importance of further research in this area.  Nevertheless, studies like this one, which analyze large amounts of medical data to identify trends in health and disease, offer valuable insights for future investigations into risk factors for conditions such as dementia. They provide doctors, pharmacists, and patients with information to weigh the benefits against potential side effects when considering the use of any medication.  As individuals seek relief from heartburn, it is crucial to be aware of the potential consequences that indigestion drugs can have on the body. While some risks have been firmly established, others remain plausible but require further confirmation from authorities.”Xˆ
  Whitney Houston's recent passing has once again thrust the fragility of human life into the global spotlight, emphasizing how easily it can slip away in an instant. However, her death has also shed light on a harsh reality - FDA-approved pharmaceutical drugs, used in the treatment of diseases, have become a leading cause of death not only in the United States but also within the entertainment industry. Over the years, selfnews has extensively covered the deaths of numerous celebrities, singers, actors, and cultural icons who met their unfortunate demise due to prescription drug overdoses. While some of these individuals perished as a result of misusing pharmaceutical drugs, others were in a state of impairment caused by these medications, rendering them susceptible to careless and even suicidal behaviors that eventually sealed their fate. Below, we present a concise timeline of celebrity deaths caused by pharmaceutical drugs. While it is acknowledged that some of these individuals intentionally misused both prescription and illicit drugs, leading to their demise, others were arguably heavily influenced by these highly addictive drugs in the first place. This influence led them to further abuse dangerous, yet legally obtainable, prescription drugs, often under the guidance of their physicians.  1962: Marilyn Monroe, an American actress, singer, and model, reportedly died from a barbiturate overdose. Barbiturates are a class of drugs that artificially induce relaxation and sleep. Though the precise circumstances surrounding her death remain disputed, it was officially declared as "acute barbiturate poisoning."  1968: Nick Adams, a prominent American actor and a close friend of James Dean and Elvis Presley, allegedly died from an overdose of barbiturates as well. His enigmatic death was officially classified as "accidental-suicidal and undetermined," but high levels of sedatives were discovered in his bloodstream.  1977: Iconic singer Elvis Presley had a lengthy history of prescription drug abuse, having developed an addiction to stimulants during his military service. His personal physician, Dr. George Nichopoulos, reportedly supplied Presley with pills during his singing career "without concern for his health," ultimately leading to his fatal overdose.  1994: Kurt Cobain, former lead singer and guitarist of the band Nirvana, supposedly died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Many reports link this tragic event to a lethal dose of heroin. Like several others on this list, Cobain had a history of illicit drug abuse. However, following his death, reports indicated the presence of diazepam, an anti-anxiety medication marketed as Valium, in”Xv
  Although approximately 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are officially reported in the United States each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that the actual number of cases is likely to be about 10 times higher. Unfortunately, the usual course of treatment for Lyme disease, which involves antibiotics, has proven to be ineffective. However, Dr. David Minkoff has developed a better solution for curing Lyme disease that focuses on building up the immune system instead of tearing it down.  On the upcoming selfnews Talk Hour, Jonathan Landsman and Dr. David Minkoff will discuss the symptoms of Lyme disease and present a treatment plan that is more effective than the antibiotic regimen promoted by Western medicine. This show promises to provide surprising facts about this debilitating condition and offer practical, life-changing advice on how to diminish its effects.

Lyme disease: Choosing the pathway to an effective cure  The symptoms of early Lyme disease can vary, but often include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, sweats, muscle aches, fatigue, nausea, and joint pain. Conventional medicine typically relies on antibiotics as the primary treatment. However, many chronic Lyme disease patients continue to suffer, despite aggressive rounds of antibiotics. Moreover, Lyme disease is known to be an underlying cause of numerous other health problems, including ALS, Lupus, Parkinson's Disease, and Rheumatoid Arthritis.  Dr. Minkoff's clinic takes a different approach to treatment, focusing on rebuilding the immune system so that the body can respond by targeting the infection. Instead of relying solely on antibiotics, his clinic utilizes "natural antibiotics" such as ozone or hydrogen peroxide, which have proven to be quite effective. However, a comprehensive program is essential for removing chronic Lyme disease symptoms. Join us for the next selfnews Talk Hour with Jonathan Landsman and Dr. David Minkoff, where they will discuss the signs of this widespread condition and present effective, natural means of treating Lyme disease without antibiotics.

Ozone therapy works by increasing the amount of oxygen in the body, aiding”XÁ   Outrage over mass murder incidents in the United States has been a topic of discussion in recent years. Experts in foreign policy and national security, as well as politicians, have expressed concern over the ISIS terrorist movement and its brutal attacks on unarmed individuals. However, there has been a distinct lack of attention given to the lives lost due to abortion. This silence has become even more pronounced since the release of videos showing Planned Parenthood officials negotiating the sale of body parts from aborted babies. According to the latest data from Planned Parenthood's 2013-2014 report, the organization performed a total of 327,653 abortions in one year, averaging 898 abortions per day. The disparity between lives lost to abortion and lives lost to other causes, such as mass shootings, is quite significant. While the mainstream media often covers mass shootings extensively, the reporting on Planned Parenthood's actions has been limited. The media tends to focus on advocating for gun control after such incidents, interviewing pundits and politicians who are against the Second Amendment. However, when comparing the number of daily deaths from shootings to the number of lives lost in Planned Parenthood clinics, the difference is stark. According to the FBI's Crime in the United States report for 2012, there were a total of 8,855 gun-related homicides that year, averaging around 24.3 per day. In contrast, the daily abortion total at Planned Parenthood clinics was 898. The number of people killed in mass murders is less than one per day, and acts of terrorism in the US are even more rare. The lack of reporting on the Planned Parenthood scandal by the mainstream media has not gone unnoticed. Influential social commentators and analysts have criticized the media for ignoring the story. Camille Paglia, in an interview with Salon, highlighted the insularity of liberal thought in the media and its failure to cover important stories like this.”Xš	  The health benefits of kale have garnered increasing attention in recent times, particularly due to the rising popularity of kale chips as a nutritious snack. However, kale's advantages extend beyond general well-being, as it has the potential to enhance one's sex life in multiple ways. As a superfood, kale aids in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, provides energy, and stimulates the brain, promoting a positive mood. Additionally, it keeps individuals feeling satiated for longer periods due to its nutrient-dense composition, and it balances hormone levels to increase sex drive and energy. A mere cup of chopped, raw kale provides over 100% of the daily recommended intake of vitamins A, C, and K.   Key vitamins in kale contribute to its sex appeal. Vitamin A is crucial for normal reproduction, as a deficiency can lead to reduced sex hormone production, dry and irritated skin, and atrophy of the testicles and ovaries, potentially resulting in sterilization. Hence, consuming kale's vitamin A content helps maintain sexual health. High levels of vitamin C in kale aid in iron absorption, blood cell formation, and adrenal gland metabolism, all of which contribute to improved sexual performance. Furthermore, the iron in kale ensures the delivery of oxygen-rich blood, carrying essential nutrients and hormones to the sex organs for pleasure and endurance.   Kale's benefits for sexual health extend beyond vitamins. Its chlorophyll content, an alkaline-forming compound, promotes flexibility, endurance, and range of motion, while also reducing inflammation that can cause sluggishness and bloating. Vitamin B6 found in kale regulates prolactin, a libido enhancer that increases sex hormone production. Moreover, vitamin B6 has been shown to alleviate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), particularly when obtained from natural food sources like kale. Magnesium, another nutrient in kale, plays a vital role in producing neurotransmitters and sex hormones that control the sex organs. Additionally, the potassium content in kale further boosts sex drive, making this leafy green a powerhouse for sexual vitality.   Various other nutritious foods contribute to a fulfilling sex life.

  New Orleans, a city that experienced the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina, serves as a cautionary tale for the rest of America. The economic and nutritional degradation resulting from the disaster mirrors the struggles faced by many cities across the country. Filmmaker Robert Lee Grant, who witnessed the aftermath of Katrina firsthand, was inspired to take action and help children in need. His documentary, "Nourishing the Kids of Katrina," sheds light on the power of organic gardening and permaculture in schoolyards, even during the most dire circumstances.  The film focuses on the story of the Green Charter School in New Orleans, which suffered immense damage from the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina. Chef Alice Waters' "edible schoolyard" program played a crucial role in the school's revival. While it may seem that the stark contrast between the poor, black children of New Orleans and the affluent, white individuals from Berkeley who share Waters' philosophy would be the film's driving force, it is actually the underlying message about the fragility of our food and currency systems that makes it so powerful.  "Nourishing the Kids of Katrina" demonstrates the importance of self-sufficiency when it comes to food production. The film reveals the process of starting and maintaining edible schoolyards, showcasing the transformative impact they have on the lives of children. The preview of the film, available at http://premium.selfnews.tv/Nourishing_the_Kids.htm, provides a glimpse into both sides of this compelling story.  The film emphasizes the role of schools in fostering a deep connection between children and their environment. Many alternative schools and homeschooling programs incorporate gardens as a central component of their curriculum, aiming to nurture children's individuality, creativity, and critical thinking skills. The mantra of "If they grow it, they will eat it" serves as a guiding principle in "Nourishing the Kids of Katrina," which features prominent figures such as Alice Waters, health professionals, educators, and students. Waters, a renowned chef from Chez Panisse Restaurant, advocates for the lifelong benefits of connecting with the Earth's soils from an early age. Grant, the filmmaker, shares her conviction and believes that all schools can implement similar initiatives, providing children with invaluable lessons about nutrition, science, and citizenship.  In a world where education often stifles individuality, "Nourishing the Kids of Katrina" presents a refreshing alternative. The film serves as a wake-up call, urging us to prioritize the well-being of our children and the sustainability of our food systems. As we witness the potential collapse of our”X6  Enzymes, vital for human well-being, are integral to various bodily processes such as digestion, immune response, cognitive function, and detoxification. To enhance your digestive system, obtaining a diverse range of digestive enzymes is crucial. Acting as keys to specific locks within the body, enzymes are long-chain proteins that assume distinct shapes. They carry out precise functions throughout the body, primarily produced by the pancreas and named pancreatic enzymes.  The significance of enzymes in the digestive process cannot be overstated. They are critical for breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and fatty acids, facilitating their proper digestion and assimilation in the body. However, individuals facing digestive difficulties often struggle to generate sufficient quantities of digestive enzymes, rendering them unable to effectively process the food they consume. This improper digestion ultimately leads to heightened stress and inflammation in the gut lining, consequently causing the deterioration of mucosal membranes and the development of leaky gut syndrome.  When the mucosal membrane becomes damaged, it loses its ability to secrete the necessary enzymes, creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates gut inflammation. Recognizing the symptoms of low pancreatic enzymes is crucial in addressing this issue.”X†
  Turmeric, a member of the ginger family, has long been regarded as a remarkable gift from nature. This ancient spice, known for its yellow hue and prominent role in curry, has been extensively studied and is believed to offer a staggering array of potential preventive and therapeutic applications. With over 600 potential uses and 175 distinct physiological benefits, turmeric has captured the attention of experts in the field.  Originating from India, where it is a staple in both cuisine and medicine, turmeric contains several potent compounds, including curcumin. This spice has been utilized for centuries to address a variety of ailments, such as diabetes, inflammation, and depression. In fact, research suggests that curcumin's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties can help protect against heart attacks. Animal studies have even shown that curcumin has the ability to destroy cancer cells and enhance the effects of chemotherapy.  Turmeric has proven successful in treating numerous serious medical conditions, some of which can be life-threatening. Its benefits extend beyond the physical realm, as it has been linked to improved brain health. Aromatic turmerone, another compound found in turmeric, has been associated with the brain's ability to repair itself after an injury. This discovery could have significant implications for stroke victims, who often suffer long-term neurological damage.  In addition, studies have shown that turmeric can delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes. The use of curcumin supplements has proven effective in this regard, offering a natural alternative to traditional pharmaceutical interventions. Turmeric has also been found to alleviate joint pain, surpassing the efficacy of medications like ibuprofen. Its anti-inflammatory properties make it a promising treatment for arthritis and other conditions affecting the joints.  Furthermore, turmeric has demonstrated its usefulness in the digestive realm. Curcumin has been shown to stimulate bile production in the gall bladder, providing relief from indigestion and discomfort. It may also offer benefits for conditions such as heartburn, ulcers, Chrohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) even recommends turmeric for a variety of other ailments, including headaches, bronchitis, fibromyalgia, and menstrual problems.  One of the great advantages of turmeric is its versatility. Incorporating this spice into your diet is simple and convenient. You can easily sprinkle turmeric on a wide range of dishes, such as salads, soups, rice, eggs, vegetables, and tea, to maintain good health.  In conclusion, turmeric's”X©  Big Pharma has been tirelessly searching for drugs that target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a group of nuclear receptor proteins in the human body. These proteins regulate the expression of genes involved in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, making them potential targets for treating diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity. However, it turns out that a compound in grapefruit may already have these capabilities, without the side effects associated with pharmaceutical drugs.  Scientists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) have discovered that naringenin, an antioxidant found in the bitter flavor of grapefruits and other citrus fruits, triggers the liver to break down fat. While the pancreas is important for diabetics, the liver is the primary organ responsible for regulating carbohydrates and blood fat levels. Normally, after a meal, sugars in the blood activate an inflammatory PPAR called LXR-alpha, which prompts the liver to produce fatty acids for long-term storage. However, during periods of fasting or low carb dieting, the process is reversed, and fat cells release fatty acids, breaking them down into ketones. This also increases insulin sensitivity.  The new research, published in the online journal PLoS ONE, reveals that naringenin activates two types of PPARs (PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma) while blocking LXR-alpha, resulting in fasting-like benefits to the body. Martin L. Yarmush, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Center for Engineering in Medicine and one of the study's authors, likened the process to the Atkins diet, minus the side effects. Yaakov Nahmias, PhD, the senior author of the study, described the findings as a fascinating discovery, noting that the pharmaceutical industry has long sought these results through drug research, but safety concerns have hindered their development. In contrast, naringenin is a dietary supplement with a proven safety record and may even protect the liver from damage.  If the results of this study are confirmed in human patients, the research team believes that the grapefruit compound could potentially be used to treat high cholesterol, type-2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.”•      X±  ATM Metabolics researchers claim to have discovered a naturally occurring chemical in fruits and vegetables that shields the body from the diabetes-inducing effects of sugars. Specializing in the treatment of metabolic and neurological disorders, ATM Metabolics isolated and examined a chemical named simulin, which displayed various beneficial properties. In addition to enhancing the removal of excess sugar from the bloodstream, simulin heightened the sensitivity of insulin receptors, decreased carbohydrate absorption, reduced glucose production by the liver, and even facilitated the mobilization of carbohydrates from fat cells.  Describing simulin as a "sugar defense mechanism," the researchers proposed that this chemical aids the body in combatting the detrimental effects of sugar consumption. They suggested that its inclusion in foods and beverages could potentially shield against diabetes and may even permit individuals with diabetes to reintroduce sugary foods into their diets. It is important to note that simulin is not a sweetener, but rather a compound that could be incorporated into already sweetened products.  The researchers speculated that simulin evolved as a mechanism to encourage animals to consume more fruit by safeguarding them against diabetes. "Fruit plants depend on their fruits being eaten to spread, so it makes sense that they would do everything they could to keep their fruit on the menu," stated Daryl Thompson, a researcher involved in the study. Thompson further explained that humans did not develop diabetes despite consuming substantial amounts of sugar from fruits and vegetables due to this protective mechanism.  To pave the way for simulin's use as a commercial food additive, further studies are currently underway to examine its effects. Thompson expressed confidence that as a natural product, simulin should not require special approval from the FDA and could likely attain Generally Recognized As Safe status. Consequently, Thompson anticipates substantial interest from both companies and consumers once the product is ready. "We've received a positive response from the food industry, and we believe consumers will embrace it due to its natural origin," he added.”Xá   Soviet-style government food distribution is rapidly becoming the norm in the deteriorating United States of America, as over 20 percent of Americans now rely on the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. The fast food industry is now pushing for food stamps to cover their offerings, such as buckets of fried chicken at KFC and Meximelts at Taco Bell. Food stamp benefits have more than doubled in the past six years, skyrocketing from $28.5 billion in 2005 to $64.7 billion in 2010. This increase also led to the inclusion of 53,000 new businesses, including convenience stores, dollar discount stores, and even gas stations. Now, the fast food industry is vying for a share of the pie. According to a recent report in USA Today, Yum! Brands, based in Louisville, Ky., which owns Taco Bell, KFC, Long John Silver's, and Pizza Hut, is lobbying the federal government to allow SNAP enrollees to use food stamps at their restaurants, claiming that it will help combat hunger. However, opponents argue that this proposal is absurd and a misappropriation of public funds towards unhealthy junk food instead of nutritious options. Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, states, "It's preposterous that a company like Yum! Brands would even be considered for inclusion in a program meant for supplemental nutrition." Granting the fast food industry a place in the food stamps program would essentially divert taxpayer money into a system that promotes both system abuse and poor health. Fast food is known to contain toxic chemicals, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and lacks nutritional value. If participation in the food stamp program continues to rise, as expected in an economy facing ongoing decline, it will result in a government-operated food distribution system where most Americans have no choice but to consume the unhealthy offerings of their local fast food establishments.”X
  Eating Watercress May Reduce Cancer Damage, Study Finds  A recent study conducted by researchers at Ulster University and published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has found that consuming 85 grams of watercress per day can significantly decrease cancer damage to white blood cells and increase levels of cancer-fighting antioxidants in the body. This discovery has led scientists to believe that the vegetable may hinder the growth of cancer cells, and even potentially eliminate them.  The study involved feeding 30 men and 30 women 85 grams of watercress daily, in addition to their regular diets. The participants, who ranged in age from 19 to 35, included both smokers and non-smokers. Among those with cancer, damage to their white blood cells decreased by 22.9 percent. Additionally, the levels of antioxidants in their blood significantly increased over the course of the study, particularly among the smokers. Antioxidants play a crucial role in removing cell-damaging "free radicals" from the body, thus reducing the risk of cancer.  Watercress, an aquatic leafy vegetable, is known for its high quantities of iron, calcium, and vitamin C. The study was funded by the Watercress Alliance, which consists of the three largest watercress producers in the United Kingdom. However, some scientists have criticized the study for its small sample size and disputed the claim that watercress provides a greater anti-cancer benefit than other fruits and vegetables. Professor Karol Sikora, a cancer medicine expert at Imperial College, described the study's conclusions as "grossly overstated."  Lead researcher Professor Ian Rowland defended the study, stating, "Population studies have shown links between the intake of cruciferous vegetables like watercress and a reduced risk of a number of cancers.... What makes this study unique is that it involves people consuming watercress in easily achievable amounts, to observe the impact on known bio-markers of cancer risk, such as DNA damage."  While watercress is often hailed as an "anti-cancer food" due to its phytonutrients that boost the body's defenses against cancer, some argue that studying the anti-cancer effects of a single food is a limited approach. A comprehensive anti-cancer diet includes a variety of foods and herbs that work synergistically to combat cancer, such as onions, garlic, broccoli, raw sprouts, almonds, and blueberries.  Critics claim that many conventional scientists are unwilling to acknowledge that foods contain potent anti-cancer substances that have been proven to be more effective”Xÿ
  In the realm of political discourse, the Left has developed various methods to control the thoughts, speech, and perspectives of Americans, thereby infringing upon our constitutional principles, particularly the First Amendment's protection of free speech and freedom of association. The notion that individuals possess the right to express their opinions has now been undermined. When individuals deviate from the Left's prescribed boundaries of acceptable behavior, they are met with attempts to marginalize them, defame their character, tarnish their reputations, and â€“ a tactic frequently employed by liberal media â€“ distort their words, thoughts, and beliefs.  Recently, these measures were employed against former U.S. Representative Dr. Ron Paul, a long-standing Texas Republican known for his support of an originalist interpretation of the Constitution. The Washington Post, in particular, played a role in this smear campaign. Thomas E. Woods, a commentator on The Tom Woods Show, shed light on the hit piece published by the Post, which targeted Paul following a public event in Houston. During this event, participants engaged in politically incorrect discussions, including the topic of secession. The Mises Institute, a think tank devoted to promoting the economic liberty principles of Ludwig von Mises, hosted the event titled 'Mises Circle Event on Secession.'  The objective of the gathering was to explore the concept of states breaking away from oppressive governments that undermine liberty, peace, and prosperity. As secession movements gain traction worldwide, the event aimed to delve into the philosophical and historical foundations of secession, the advantages of radical decentralization, and the potential for disengagement from tyrannical states as a last resort to safeguard the endangered classical liberal tradition.  Woods revealed on his program that the Post reporter was present at the event with the intention of besmirching Ron Paul and all the participants, as the idea of secession lies beyond the confines of acceptable opinion. Woods further played a clip of his own speech, emphasizing that he deliberately tailored his remarks as a response to the mainstream media's mentality. Astonishingly, when the Post article was published, it mentioned other speakers at the event by name, but conspicuously omitted any reference to Woods.  A review of the Post's online article corroborated Woods' claim â€“ there was no mention of him. This deliberate omission serves as a testament to the media's agenda to suppress certain perspectives and promote conformity to their approved narrative. The incident involving Dr. Ron Paul and Thomas E. Woods exemplifies the growing trend of stifling dissent and manipulating public discourse to fit a particular ideological mold. In the”X”  In a recent interview conducted by Mike Adams, Dr. Hank Liers, the chief formulator of products sold by Health Products Distributors, Inc. (HPDI), discussed the negative reactions that people with chemical sensitivities may have to mainstream supplements. These reactions can range from feeling sick to experiencing cognitive impairment, body pain, and gastrointestinal issues. According to Dr. Liers, many chemically sensitive individuals are unable to take any supplements.  Dr. Liers shared the story of his wife, who suffered from a functional magnesium deficiency despite having enough magnesium in her blood. To address this issue, Dr. Liers formulated a product called Myo-Mag, which is primarily magnesium malate and also contains coenzyme B vitamins. Magnesium malate, with its ability to kick the Kreb's cycle into gear, proved to be highly beneficial for his wife. The inclusion of coenzyme B vitamins in Myo-Mag was crucial, as they are necessary to activate the Kreb's cycle. Dr. Liers also buffered the formula to assist individuals who are chemically sensitive and struggle with acidity.  Dr. Liers emphasized the importance of taking action to improve one's health rather than passively waiting for improvement. He believes that by pushing boundaries and making these innovative products more widely available, positive change can occur.  In regards to the green color of HPDI's Rejuvenate superfood, Dr. Liers and Mike Adams addressed concerns some may have about its appearance. They suggested starting with a small amount of the product to gradually acclimate oneself to the green color. Over time, they believe that individuals will associate green with health and be more open to incorporating it into their diets.  Dr. Liers noted that some customers have found success by adding a small amount of Rejuvenate to fruit or berry smoothies, as they enjoy the smell and color. As they begin to feel the health benefits, Dr. Liers believes that these individuals will eventually transition to consuming more of the green superfood.  Overall, Dr. Liers and HPDI are dedicated to providing high-quality, chemically sensitive-friendly supplements that promote health and well-being.”XÛ  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been actively working to combat fraud in the federal food stamp program for the past 15 years, according to recent reports. The program, which provides assistance to almost 50 million Americans and adds more than 10,000 new enrollees every day, is under scrutiny as the USDA considers the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) chips to track recipients at a national level. Two reports from the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service program in 1999 reveal the agency's goal of improving the integrity of the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program (SNAP), by using biometric identification technologies. Several states, including California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, already employ biometric technologies such as fingerprint identification and facial recognition, and the federal government may follow suit. However, this rollout has been gradual to avoid negative attention regarding privacy and individual liberty. RFID chips are already embedded in credit cards to reduce fraud, and the USDA is considering their use in food assistance programs. India has implemented a similar system with biometric ID cards for its 1.2 billion residents. The American system, like the Indian program, would require fingerprinting of food stamp recipients to reduce fraud. Currently, the implementation of the American system is happening on a state or local level, without federal administration.”XD	  The pomegranate, scientifically known as Punica granatum, is a remarkable superfood with a rich and lengthy history. This small deciduous tree or large shrub has been traced back to 4000 B.C. through historical documents, and is native to the East. The pomegranate produces vibrant red flowers that eventually give way to a fruit roughly the size of a lemon and a grapefruit. Within the thick skin lies white flesh filled with hundreds of seeds.  Pomegranates are not only cultivated as a fruit crop, but also as ornamental trees or shrubs in parks and gardens. They are resilient plants that can tolerate drought and moderate frost, thriving in climates similar to the Mediterranean region, California, or Northern India. There are numerous genotypes of pomegranates, showcasing variations in exocarp and aril color, seed hardness, fruit size, juice content, astringency, and more.  Over the past few decades, the pomegranate has gained popularity in North America. However, this fruit has a history that spans thousands of years and is mentioned in ancient texts such as the Torah, the Quran, the Homeric Hymns, and Mesopotamian records. The name "pomegranate" is derived from Medieval Latin, meaning "seeded apple." It originated from Persia, now known as Iran, and the western Himalayas. Cultivation of pomegranates has taken place in regions such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Russia, and the Mediterranean for millennia. It even made its way to China and Southeast Asia along the Silk Road, symbolizing abundance and posterity.  Pomegranates have left their mark in various cultures throughout history. Archaeologists have discovered carbonized pomegranate exocarps in ancient sites like Jericho, Cyprus, and Egyptian tombs, including that of King Tut. In Ancient Egypt, the fruit held great value and was a staple in the pharaoh's residence. Its significance was so profound that it was depicted in paintings on walls and tombs, symbolizing life after death. The pomegranate served many purposes, with the fruit being consumed as food, the juice used as a tonic to eliminate parasites, the blossom crushed to create a red dye, and the peel utilized for dyeing leather.  The pomegranate's influence extended to Jerusalem, where it adorned the pillars of Solomon's temple and the robes of Jewish priests. In ancient Rome, including the city of Pompeii,”X 
  The traditional media industry is facing a significant challenge as more and more Americans turn to independent and alternative news sources, seeking the truth in a landscape saturated with propaganda. According to Agence France-Presse, the value of old media, particularly the newspaper industry, has experienced a sharp decline in recent years due to the rise of new media platforms. This trend was exemplified by the sale of the San Diego Union-Tribune in May for $85 million, a meager sum compared to its estimated worth of $1 billion in 2004.  This decline in value is not unique to the San Diego Union-Tribune; major newspapers across the country, including the Boston Globe, Philadelphia Inquirer, Minneapolis Star-Tribune, and Chicago Sun-Times, have seen valuations drop by more than 90 percent from their peak. While these legacy papers have attempted to retain readership by offering digital subscriptions and mobile apps, these efforts have proven insufficient for many. Over the past decade, weekday circulation for US dailies has declined by 17 percent, and ad revenue has fallen by more than 50 percent as advertisers shift their focus to online platforms, as reported by the Pew Research Center.  The financial struggles facing the newspaper industry have led some media companies to spin off their newspapers in order to concentrate on more profitable ventures such as broadcast or digital properties. Ken Doctor, an industry analyst and author of the Newsonomics blog, points out that despite nearly two decades of effort, most newspaper chains have not made significant progress in their digital transformation. Doctor predicts that newspapers will soon have no choice but to reduce the frequency of their print editions or transition completely to digital platforms, as some have already done. However, the latter option presents its own challenges, as developing a user-friendly digital platform that maintains the identity of the print version requires substantial investment. With ad revenues stagnant since 2008, the funds necessary for such investments are simply not available.  In the first quarter of this year, the seven largest newspaper groups collectively generated a mere $21 million in profit, a stark contrast to the $1.8 billion earned by the Gannett group alone in 2005. "These companies have little to invest," Doctor explains. "They're still burdened by debt, dividends, pension obligations, and the relentless decline in print ad revenue." As the industry grapples with these financial challenges, the future looks uncertain for traditional newspapers.”X3	  In the United States, where freedom of speech is a fundamental right, there persists a troubling issue of censorship. This problem has only grown worse in recent months, as demonstrated by the actions of YouTube and Google. These platforms have placed an age restriction on a satirical video titled "TSA: Help Wanted," created by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger and founder of our publication. This video exposed the Transportation Security Administration's absurd policies and the concerning number of officers with criminal records and involvement in illicit activities, including child pornography.  Ironically, while YouTube restricts access to such satirical content, it allows hackers to freely promote their malicious services without any limitations or restrictions. One video, narrated by an American male, shamelessly promotes a website called DDoS Service, specializing in Distributed Denial of Service attacks. This video, lasting a minute and 48 seconds, showcases the narrator advertising the hacker's offerings, targeting business competitors, rivals, and anyone the client desires to take down. The service is priced between five and fifty dollars per hour, depending on the size and level of protection of the targeted website. The video concludes with the narrator providing contact information for interested parties and emphasizing the service's acceptance of secure forms of payment.  TechWeekEurope, a British technology website, describes this marketing approach as remarkably brazen. It is astonishing that YouTube allows such videos to be published, as this particular video has already garnered over 32,000 views since its upload in mid-June. This is not the first instance of YouTube serving as a platform for promoting hacker services. Another video, titled "Gwapo's Professional DDoS Service," reinforces the hacker firm's presence and offers its services to a wider audience.  The existence of such uninhibited and unrestricted marketing tactics raises concerns about the state of freedom of speech in our nation. While satirical content criticizing government agencies is being censored, platforms like YouTube seem to turn a blind eye to the promotion of malicious activities. This disparity is alarming, and it calls for a closer examination of the principles and values that guide our society's approach to free expression.”X	  Brazil's Zika outbreak may be more severe than previously believed, according to Brazil's top health official. The majority of infected individuals do not show any symptoms, making it difficult to determine the true extent of the outbreak. Zika, a mosquito-borne virus, has recently spread through Latin America, with researchers suggesting a possible link to thousands of cases of microcephaly, a congenital condition characterized by an abnormally small head and underdeveloped brains.  The World Health Organization has declared the Latin American Zika outbreak a global emergency due to concerns that the virus may be causing microcephaly in pregnant women. However, very few cases of microcephaly have shown any trace of the virus. Microcephaly typically results in hampered physical and mental development in 90 percent of cases.  The Zika virus was first identified in Africa in 1947 but was unknown in the Americas until it reached Brazil in May 2015. The Brazilian government believes it may have been brought to the continent by an infected visitor during the 2014 World Cup. Mosquitoes that bit the infected individual then contracted and spread the virus. As more people became infected, the mosquito population also became infected, allowing the virus to become endemic.  The Pan-American Health Organization reports that Zika has spread from Brazil to 24 other countries and territories in the Western Hemisphere. Colombia has experienced over 3,100 cases of pregnant women with Zika but has not confirmed any cases of microcephaly. Evidence suggests that the release of genetically modified mosquitoes may have accelerated the spread of the virus, inadvertently increasing the population of mosquitoes that carry it.  Brazil has seen a total of 3,700 suspected and confirmed new microcephaly cases since the outbreak began, a trend that actually predates the Zika epidemic. Health Minister Marcelo Castro claims that the Zika virus is causing microcephaly in pregnant mothers, contradicting claims that the virus can be transmitted from person to person through bodily fluids. Castro warns that the situation is serious and worrying, as the high number of asymptomatic cases makes it difficult to determine the true severity of the outbreak.  In response, Brazil is taking drastic measures to combat the virus.”X
  Is Cosmetic Surgery the Key to Job Security?  In recent years, there has been a surge in stories about men turning to cosmetic surgery in a desperate attempt to save their jobs. The motivation behind this trend is intriguing - middle-aged men seeking a more youthful appearance to secure better career opportunities. What does this say about age discrimination in the workplace? It seems that the older one gets, the higher the likelihood of being replaced. Men believe that by undergoing procedures such as facelifts, nose jobs, and hair transplants, they can maintain their current positions or even land better job prospects. Unfortunately, their reasoning may not be entirely unfounded. Many employers, whether consciously or not, tend to judge individuals based on their looks. It appears that attributes like hair color, apparent youthfulness, and physical fitness often influence how a person's abilities are perceived, even if these factors do not necessarily align with job performance.  However, I propose an alternative solution to appearing younger without resorting to invasive cosmetic procedures like liposuction or surgery: enhancing mental acuity. If one truly wishes to safeguard their employment, the best approach, in my opinion, is to focus on improving cognitive function - developing a sharper memory, expanding one's vocabulary, nurturing creativity, and honing analytical skills. Achieving this can be accomplished through lifestyle changes, particularly by adopting a nutritionally sound diet and engaging in brain exercises.  When it comes to nutrition, there is a wide range of actions one can take to enhance brain function. Firstly, it is crucial to avoid consuming foods and ingredients that can harm the nervous system, which I refer to as "metabolic disruptors." Hydrogenated oils, commonly regarded as brain poison, should be eliminated from one's diet. Additionally, it is advisable to reduce reliance on prescription drugs, with the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional. Many medications, such as statins, profoundly interfere with brain function. If you find that your memory is fading and your ability to concentrate has diminished while taking statins, it is highly likely that these drugs are the cause. Therefore, discontinuing their use and returning to a state of normal, healthy brain function is imperative. It is also worth noting that artificial colors in food can have detrimental effects on brain function.  In conclusion, while men may believe that cosmetic surgery holds the key to job security, perhaps a more effective and natural approach lies in enhancing mental performance. By focusing on cognitive abilities through lifestyle changes such as nutrition and brain exercises, individuals can potentially safeguard their careers and overcome age discrimination in the workplace.”Xs
  The global swine flu pandemic of 2009 is unraveling as countries around the world find themselves burdened with surplus doses of unused vaccines. Public sentiment has shifted, and informed individuals are no longer interested in receiving the injection. The fear-based campaign that was employed to promote the vaccines has been debunked as nothing more than quackery and propaganda. Even medical professionals are now denouncing the pandemic as a complete hoax.  Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, a prominent health authority in Europe, has spoken out against the drug companies, claiming that they orchestrated a "campaign of panic" to pressure the World Health Organization (WHO) into declaring a pandemic. He believes this scandal to be one of the greatest in the history of medicine and has called for an investigation into the matter.  In reality, the H1N1 swine flu was never as dangerous as it was made out to be, and it should never have been classified as a level-six pandemic. The entire situation was a meticulously crafted marketing scheme designed solely to sell vaccines. Shockingly, even the CDC and WHO were complicit in this deception.  The scheme proved to be immensely successful, as Big Pharma profited billions of dollars from a vaccine that ultimately proved to be unnecessary. These vaccines were funded by taxpayer dollars, making the 2009 Swine Flu Hoax an elaborate financial scam that aimed to transfer wealth from the general public to the shareholders of pharmaceutical companies. GlaxoSmithKline alone shipped $1.4 billion worth of vaccines in the fourth quarter of 2009, all paid for by taxpayers. This money could have been better allocated towards nutrition or genuine health education.  Vitamin D supplements, for instance, would have been a more effective investment in public health than the vaccines ever were. The greed and deceit exhibited by Big Pharma, the CDC, and the WHO make the Wall Street hucksters look like amateurs. These organizations deliberately misled the public, exploiting their fears to generate profits from unnecessary vaccine shots. The vaccines provided no significant reduction in mortality, and their long-term side effects remain unknown. In fact, it is possible that they may even lead to an increase in mortality.  Tragically, many individuals fell victim to the swine flu vaccine frenzy. Countless individuals suffered severe adverse reactions, some even experiencing near paralysis. In a disturbing incident, school staff members in Massachusetts, who had lined up to receive the swine flu vaccine, were mistakenly injected with insulin, which can induce a coma. This mishap was blamed on the school nurse, but it would”XI
  In a scathing new report titled "Breast Cancer Deception," consumer health advocate Mike Adams accuses the breast cancer industry of operating a racist medical scheme that preys on black women for corporate gain. Adams's report, available now on www.NewsTarget.com, sheds light on the reason behind the disproportionately high rates of breast cancer mortality among black women compared to their white counterparts. He also alleges that the industry purposefully withholds vital information from black women that could prevent nearly 80% of breast cancer cases, using a readily available nutrient produced by the human body under certain conditions. The report is accessible at www.NewsTarget.com/Report_Breast_Cancer_Dece....  Adams claims that the breast cancer industry, which he believes is predominantly run by wealthy white men, exploits low-income black women to generate exorbitant profits. He asserts that the industry deliberately neglects to educate black women about the true causes of the severity of their cancers compared to white women. Simultaneously, it fails to enlighten them about a simple and natural solution for breast cancer prevention, which could potentially reduce national breast cancer rates by over 75%. Adams supports his claims with data from the National Cancer Institute and extensive research on the effects of vitamin D in inhibiting cancer tumor growth. By combining three key factors - the sun-blocking properties of dark skin, the intensity of ultraviolet light in specific geographical latitudes, and recent findings on the cancer-preventing abilities of vitamin D - Adams presents a compelling and self-evident explanation for the higher incidence of serious cancers among black men and women compared to whites.  While the cancer industry claims to be confounded by this disparity and professes ignorance about the reasons behind black women experiencing more severe cancers than white women, Adams believes the true explanation lies in chronic vitamin D deficiency resulting from darker skin pigmentation, indoor work environments, and living at Northern latitudes where sunlight intensity is reduced. These factors explain why nearly all black children born in the US today suffer from vitamin D deficiency and why black women experience such severe cases of breast cancer. Adequate levels of vitamin D in the bloodstream can halt the growth of breast cancer tumors, but chronic deficiency allows the tumors to grow unchecked.  Adams asserts that the breast cancer industry capitalizes on the nutritional unawareness of black women and perpetuates a system of "medical slavery" that transforms their bodies into cash-generating machines for pharmaceutical companies and cancer non-profit organizations. He condemns pink ribbon products as deceptive and claims that many of the products associated with pink ribbons actually contribute to cancer”Xø	  Mother of Three Brutally Attacked by Biotechnology Industry  Sofia Gatica, a courageous mother of three, has fallen victim to the powerful biotechnology industry. In a horrifying incident, two assailants physically assaulted her after she had received death threats for her relentless activism against genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Argentina. GM Watch, a watchdog organization, reports that Gatica was approached by two men on motorbikes near her workplace, just 72 hours after receiving a terrifying death threat. Her neighbors intervened, likely saving her life.  Gatica is a prominent activist who spearheaded successful campaigns to block the planting of GMOs in Argentina. In 2012, she led the charge to require chemical companies to prove the safety of their products before gaining official approval for their use in the country. Currently, she is leading efforts to prevent the establishment of a new Monsanto facility in the Malvinas region of Argentina, where she has set up blockades to impede construction.  Recalling the traumatic experience, Gatica describes the attack by the pro-GMO thugs: "I was at the bus stop, and two men appear on a motorcycle in the opposite direction. One jumped on top of me, and they kicked and beat me. I screamed loudly, and the neighbors came out to help me." In a separate interview with La Voz del Interior, she adds that the men hit her "neck, arms, legs, everything."  Interestingly, the attackers did not steal anything from Gatica, nor did they target her property or her neighbors. This leads her to believe that the attack was orchestrated by the very biotech industry players she actively opposes. Argentina is a prime target for the biotech industry and currently ranks as the world's third-largest exporter of Monsanto's Roundup Ready GM soybeans, which require heavy applications of harmful chemicals.  After the incident, Gatica filed a complaint with the local police. However, she was initially hesitant to accept the help of guards for protection. Concerned for the safety of her three children and determined to continue her fight for food freedom, Gatica eventually agreed to have an armed guard stand watch at her property. "I didn't want to have guards watching over me," she told Cordoba's Canal 10 news. "I just want the people of Monsanto to leave me in peace."  Tragically, Gatica's fourth child reportedly died as a result of being exposed to Monsanto's agricultural chemicals. Additionally, her other three children have tested positive for agro-chemicals in their blood”Xê	  Northern White Rhino Population Nears Extinction Despite Conservation Efforts  The northern white rhino population has suffered immensely due to rampant poaching driven by the high value placed on their horns. While a few hundred or thousand individuals may seem like a small number for some species, the situation is much more dire for the northern white rhino, with only five individuals remaining on the planet. The recent death of Angalifu, a 44-year-old rhino at San Diego's National Safari Park, has further exacerbated the crisis.  While these remaining rhinos are currently under the protection of zoos and wildlife reserves, the chances of them reproducing in captivity are slim. Rhinos rarely breed in captivity, as seen with the female rhino at the San Diego Park, Nola, who was unable to produce offspring with Angalifu. The situation is further complicated by the fact that there is only one male of this species left, Sudan, who resides in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. He is accompanied by two females, Najin and Fatu. Another elderly female rhino resides in the Czech Republic at the Dvur Kralove Zoo.  The loss of Angalifu has been deeply felt by those at the safari park. Randy Rieches, the park's curator, expressed his sorrow, stating, "Angalifu's death is a tremendous loss to all of us, not only because he was well beloved here at the park but also because his death brings this wonderful species one step closer to extinction."  The urgency to protect these animals from extinction is clear, and placing them in captivity is deemed essential. In Asian cultures, where the demand for rhino horns is high, many believe in the medicinal powers and symbolic wealth associated with them, although there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. The horns, made of keratin, are highly valuable on the black market, surpassing the price of gold or platinum. Unfortunately, poaching continues to decimate the rhino population, either killing them or forcing them out of their natural habitat.  Combining natural deaths with the challenges of breeding in captivity, many fear that the complete extinction of the northern white rhino is imminent. However, there is hope that science and technology can intervene to save these magnificent creatures. Efforts are being made to explore in vitro fertilization as a means to help the rhinos reproduce. While in vitro fertilization is a relatively simple and inexpensive process for cows, it is much more complex and experimental for rhinos.  Richard Vigne, the CEO”Xí  President Criticized for Prioritizing Illegal Immigrants Over World War II Veterans  WASHINGTON - The president of the United States is facing criticism for his handling of the recent government shutdown, particularly in regards to the treatment of World War II veterans. Many American citizens, including veterans, were denied access to the National Mall, which was closed due to the shutdown. However, pro-amnesty demonstrators, including illegal immigrants, were allowed to use the Mall for a rally in support of comprehensive immigration reform.  Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, along with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, addressed the veterans at the "Million Vet March," expressing their disappointment in President Obama's priorities. Palin called his actions "shameful" and criticized his lack of respect for the veterans.  Rally attendee LaDonna Hale Curzon also expressed her frustration with the treatment of the veterans. She reported that federal officers and local police attempted to shut down the event and even blocked the entrance to the World War II memorial. Pictures circulating on the internet show police in riot gear and armored vehicles at the scene.  Critics argue that the president's decision to allow the rally for illegal immigrants while denying access to World War II veterans is a clear indication of his priorities. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Biden were among the Democrats who praised the decision to open the Mall for the pro-amnesty rally.  It is important to note that this is not a partisan criticism, but rather a statement of fact regarding any American president who allows illegal immigrants to protest on a taxpayer-funded National Mall while denying access to American citizens, particularly veterans.”X6
  In a powerful display of unity, the black community has joined the fight against forced vaccinations in California. Minister Tony Muhammad, representing Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan, delivered an impassioned speech outside the capitol building in Sacramento earlier this week, urging the public to stand up against corrupt lawmakers seeking to eliminate vaccine exemptions.  Muhammad invoked the power of God in what he called a "universal fight," cautioning rally attendees that the government is effectively declaring war on its own people by attempting to mandate vaccinations. He warned that if left unchecked, compromised elected officials would gradually erode our collective rights, including the right to refuse potentially dangerous medical treatment, until they assume complete control over all our decisions, even those concerning our children.  Muhammad drew a parallel between Senate Bill 277 (SB 277), which would prevent California parents from rejecting vaccinations for personal or philosophical reasons, and the infamous Tuskegee experiment on humans. He expressed his deep conviction against this heinous bill, which would grant only medical doctors the authority to decide whether other people's children should be exempted from vaccination, effectively stripping parents of their guardianship rights and transferring it to the state.  Speaking to an energetic crowd on the capitol steps, Muhammad thundered, "When Pharaoh saw that he could not control the people, Pharaoh called his enchanters or his magicians and he made a decree to destroy all boy babies two and under." He referenced a biblical story to highlight the potential for government tyranny resulting in mass casualties. He questioned whether SB 277 could be a similar attempt to harm children.  This comparison is particularly chilling considering the proven damage that vaccines can cause in children, including permanent hormonal changes in young boys. A 2009 report by The Huffington Post linked endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in many vaccines to the autism epidemic. The report noted that vaccines often contain aluminum adjuvants, which are endocrine-disrupting chemicals according to Dr. Harvey Karp. Vaccines, therefore, represent a significant source of one-time exposure to these chemicals during early infant development.  The societal implications of this are troubling and may help explain the rise in severe developmental disorders and chronic diseases among children today. Muhammad argues that legislators supporting SB 277 and similar medical mandates should be charged with treason, promising that they will be held accountable for their crimes against humanity. "You will not vaccinate our children in the name of the pharma companies," he declared passionately to his supporters.  To watch Muhammad's six-minute speech at the rally, visit [”Xþ
  Hypnosis and the Search for Creative Inspiration  Creativity, the ability to think beyond the confines of traditional ideas, rules, and patterns, has long fascinated researchers. However, measuring and understanding this elusive quality has proven to be a challenge. Enter hypnosis, a tool that not only aids in the study of creativity but also offers insights into the connection between creativity and hypnotizability.  The altered state of consciousness induced by hypnosis provides a unique opportunity to explore creative thinking and fantasy proneness. Researchers believe that this state could hold the key to unraveling the mysteries of creative inspiration. One groundbreaking study conducted by Bowers and van der Meulen in 1970 involved 30 highly suggestible individuals and 30 others who were less suggestible. Through a series of tests, including creative tasks, inkblots, and association tests, the researchers found that those who were more hypnotizable performed better in the creative tasks. Additionally, the study concluded that women tended to exhibit greater creativity than men.  Another study, conducted by Bowers in 1979, sought to examine the relationship between hypnosis and creativity. Participants, including students and writers, were asked to write while in a hypnotic state. The study also explored various creative styles among the participants. The results revealed that creativity was at its peak when there was no interference between associations and problem-solving.  Lynn and Rhue continued this exploration in 1988 by screening 6,000 students and selecting 780 participants for their study. These participants were divided into three groups based on their fantasy proneness and compared based on measures of hypnotizability, imagination, waking suggestibility, hallucinatory ability, creativity, psychopathology, and childhood experiences. Contrary to expectations, the researchers found that there was less of a link between fantasy proneness and hypnotizability than previously believed. This suggests that even individuals who are not inherently creative can respond positively to hypnosis. Furthermore, the study revealed that those prone to fantasy and creativity were not necessarily highly suggestible under hypnosis.  While these studies may differ in their conclusions regarding the connection between suggestibility and creativity, they all contribute to our understanding of the relationship between hypnosis and creativity. The state of hypnosis offers researchers a non-invasive and natural means of studying creativity. However, more research is needed to fully explore the intricacies of creativity and imagination.

  In a cruel twist of fate, the upper echelons of society indulge in safe, organic food while the common people, who rely on their governments for representation and protection, suffer the consequences of hidden genetically modified organisms, pesticides, and harmful contaminants. Even as the presidential family demands organic food in their kitchen, they secretly collaborate with the biotech industry. Similarly, China's elite feast on exclusive, gated organic gardens, while the rest of the population consumes genetically modified food, meat contaminated with steroids, and dairy tainted with melamine. Astonishingly, even employees of biotech giant Monsanto themselves insist on non-genetically modified food in their canteen. The right to access clean, organic, and healthy food is no longer guaranteed; it has become a political battleground, with ordinary citizens bearing the brunt of the consequences.  The contradictions are glaring in the White House, where First Lady Michelle Obama uproots the lawn to create an organic garden, while her husband advances a pro-genetically modified agenda within his administration. During Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, Michelle Obama proudly declared, "You know, in my household, over the last year we have just shifted to organic." The organic produce from their garden is not only consumed by the Obama family but also by visiting dignitaries. However, a closer look reveals that President Obama has appointed individuals with strong ties to the biotech industry to key positions: Roger Beachy, the head of the USDA, was formerly a director at Monsanto; Michael Taylor, the FDA food safety czar, was once the vice president for public policy at Monsanto; and Tom Vilsack, the Commissioner of the USDA, established the Governors' Biotechnology Partnership. Under President Obama's leadership, ten new genetically modified crops have been approved for "safe consumption."  While the political elite in China luxuriate in the safest of foods, including organic produce, grass-fed beef, and rice free of pesticides, chemicals, and genetically modified organisms, ordinary citizens suffer from a food supply contaminated with pesticides, industrial chemicals, and GMOs. Tragic incidents of illness and death have occurred due to tainted baby formula, milk products, and fake liquor. However, Chinese leaders are shielded from these dangers, with access to the highest quality food sources. In Beijing, an organic farm is guarded by a spiked fence and security personnel, providing food exclusively for top officials. At Beidaihe Sanitorium, a retreat for retired party cadres, a specialty rice that is organic and GMO-free is used. The public can”XK
  Neil deGrasse Tyson, renowned astrophysicist and founder of the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History, has long been admired for his passion for space exploration and his fascination with the wonders of the universe. However, in a recent appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher, Tyson made some surprising remarks that deviated from his usual focus on planetary discoveries and the potential benefits they could bring to Earth.  When asked about the possibility of more disastrous droughts than those experienced in California, one might have expected Tyson to discuss space exploration or propose ideas to improve conditions on our planet. Instead, his response took a different turn. "You know what I want to happen? I think it's not about finding another planet. I think it's about being masters of geo-engineering," Tyson said.  This statement raises questions about Tyson's shift in focus and his apparent disregard for utilizing planetary discoveries to help save Earth. It also brings to mind an article he authored for Natural History magazine titled "The Search for Planets" that appeared on HaydenPlanetarium.org. What happened to his passion for exploring space and its potential benefits?  Tyson's advocacy for geoengineering, specifically becoming "masters" of it, is concerning. Geoengineering refers to a variety of technologies aimed at deliberately modifying the Earth's energy balance on a large scale to counteract climate change. These technologies primarily focus on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM) methods, such as ocean fertilization, carbon dioxide extraction, aerosol injections, and space-based reflectors.  However, a report from the Congressional Research Service warns that the risks and costs associated with these technologies are largely unknown and have yet to be proven. The report also highlights the potential for significant transboundary effects if these geoengineering technologies were to be deployed.  Ironically, Tyson's suggestion to combat droughts through geoengineering could actually exacerbate the problem. A study published in Nature's Scientific Reports on the impact of artificially fertilizing the ocean found that increased rainfall resulting from such actions could negatively affect water resources and human livelihoods. The study's lead author, Chien Wang, cautioned against pursuing this course of action due to potential dangers to the hydrological cycle and marine ecosystems.  Moreover, there are arguments suggesting that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may have some positive effects. Rather than being solely detrimental, it is proposed that increased levels of carbon dioxide might actually benefit humanity.  Tyson's recent statements and his apparent shift away from space exploration and planetary discoveries raise important questions about his motivations”X
  In light of the myriad challenges posed by the government's Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to as Obamacare, major regional healthcare providers and hospitals are now exploring strategies that bypass insurance providers altogether. Critics argue that the complexity of Obamacare has morphed into an insurance company bailout rather than a sincere effort towards establishing a single-payer universal healthcare system. The ACA system retains most private corporate insurance companies by utilizing IRS tax penalties to enforce enrollment. However, this system, which was intended to assist those unable to afford private insurance, ultimately results in increased costs for those who can afford insurance plans, contributing to federal deficits and higher healthcare expenses. Consequently, healthcare organizations and hospitals are contemplating ways to entirely eliminate insurance providers from the equation. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has coined the term "Kaiserification" to describe this transformation of our healthcare system, referencing the Kaiser Permanente system that incorporates its own hospitals and clinics within their consumer-paid coverage. Dr. Kenneth L. Davis, CEO and president of the Mount Sinai Health System in New York State, announced that they will soon offer their own Medicare Advantage plan and explore opportunities to directly receive premium payments rather than channeling them through insurance companies. Davis predicts that similar organizations will follow suit. However, we must question whether this is truly the direction we desire for our healthcare system. It is worth noting that our medical system ranks 46th out of 48 nations assessed. Surprisingly, despite this low ranking, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that America's healthcare per capita costs are second only to Switzerland, a country rated in the top ten for overall healthcare performance. Consequently, we are spending exorbitant amounts for one of the worst-performing medical systems globally. Only Serbia and Brazil fare worse, while China and Cuba demonstrate superior healthcare systems. Comparatively, socialized or single-payer medical systems generally spend less as they strive to review and reduce expenses. Accusations of socialism and communism regarding Obamacare are, in my opinion, misplaced. Fascism, as defined by Benito Mussolini, the primary inspiration for Adolf Hitler's ideology, is characterized as "the marriage of corporation and state" and "a merger of state and corporate power." The presence of Big Pharma, a group of corporations protected by a government agency, the FDA, is a clear example of this phenomenon in the United States. Obamacare is designed to sustain several corporate insurers by coercing more individuals into their plans. In contrast, many countries with socialized medicine exhibit a greater openness towards alternative”XÖ  Strengthening the Body's Natural Defenses Against Ebola  As the Ebola virus continues to pose a threat, it is essential to explore natural alternatives for those who wish to avoid conventional medical treatments and the risk of exposure in hospitals. The most effective system for combating the Ebola virus is the body's own immune system. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize strengthening this defense mechanism to increase the chances of successfully fighting off an infection.   Collaborating with the Body's Natural Defenses  The only way to effectively collaborate with the body's natural defenses is to provide it with the necessary resources to function optimally. While conventional medical wisdom may argue that man-made remedies, such as vaccines, are superior to natural alternatives, it is clear that the injection of toxic chemicals and preservatives alongside antigens is not a legitimate method for enhancing immunity. Instead, improving one's relationship with nature and the medicinal resources it offers, which have proven to sustain human health for thousands of years, is the key. This entails focusing on healing foods and herbs that possess potent antibacterial and antiviral properties, while also optimizing immune system function and eliminating foods that hinder its performance.  Incorporating Antibacterial Foods, Herbs, and Solutions into Daily Consumption  Although Ebola is a viral infection, it is sensible to eliminate any harmful bacteria from the digestive system to ensure optimal immune system function. This preparation will enable the immune system to work more efficiently, which is crucial when combating more severe infections such as Ebola. Some antibacterial foods and herbs worth considering include: "”XÜ   Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has proposed a new plan for universal health care in the United States, a concept that was previously rejected over a decade ago. The plan aims to provide health care coverage to every American citizen through a pool of private insurance plans. Wyden's proposal has gained support from business and labor leaders, who believe that his plan would ensure that no individual in America is left without health coverage. Unlike the Clinton administration's failed attempt, Wyden's plan promises affordable, private health care coverage for all Americans, excluding those already covered by Medicare or the military. The Senator emphasizes that his plan would not require any additional funding, as it would utilize the same amount of money currently spent on health care in the country. Wyden argues that employer-based coverage is disappearing and proposes a system that guarantees health coverage for every American, comparable to what members of Congress receive. The plan, named the "Healthy Americans Act", has gained support from unlikely allies such as Andy Stern, the international president of the Service Employees International Union, and Steve Burd, CEO of Safeway Inc. Both Stern and Burd believe that employer-based health coverage is detrimental to the competitiveness of American companies in the global economy. Wyden's plan also addresses the issue of job transitions, allowing American workers to carry their health insurance from one job to another without any penalties. The plan aims to increase coverage while maintaining the same level of government spending on health insurance. It also proposes that employers terminate their existing health plans and provide the saved amount directly to workers as increased wages, who can then use that money to purchase health insurance from a large pool of private plans. Senator Wyden's universal health care plan offers a fresh and different approach to the long-standing issue of health care coverage in the United States.”X
  Public Health Crisis Looms as Antibiotic Use in Cattle Sparks Concerns  Consumer advocacy group, Consumers Union, is urging popular grocery chain, Trader Joe's, to cease selling meat and poultry derived from animals raised using the common industry practice of force-feeding antibiotic drugs. This practice, aimed at increasing the size of the animals and expediting meat production, is causing widespread health issues and antibiotic resistance.  Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy branch of Consumer Reports, has taken out a full-page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times to petition Trader Joe's to lead the industry in addressing this pressing matter. Given Trader Joe's previous commitment to important health and food safety issues, Consumers Union hopes that the grocery chain will once again take a stand and eliminate conventional meat from its product lineup. The full-page ad can be viewed at http://notinmyfood.org.  According to Consumers Union, a staggering 80% of antibiotics sold in the United States are used by the meat and poultry industries to accelerate animal growth and ensure tolerance to unsanitary conditions in factory farms. Trader Joe's, known for its progressive stance on health-related matters, including rejecting GMOs, artificial colors, and trans fats, is being called upon to help steer the livestock industry towards healthier practices by refusing to sell drugged meats.  While Trader Joe's already offers a range of organic, grass-fed, and antibiotic-free meat and poultry products, some of its offerings still include conventional varieties sourced from animals raised in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), the standard format for most factory farms. With a growing number of informed consumers seeking safe, antibiotic-free options, it is imperative for Trader Joe's to take immediate action and set higher standards for meat production.  Jean Halloran, Director of Food Policy Initiatives for Consumers Union, emphasizes the urgency of curbing the public health crisis of antibiotic resistance. Many respected medical and public health organizations concur that reducing antibiotic use in healthy livestock is vital to preserving the efficacy of these drugs in treating diseases.  Consumers Union launched the Meat Without Drugs campaign last year, aiming to convince all grocery stores to eliminate antibiotic-raised meats, starting with Trader Joe's. To learn more about this critical initiative and sign the petition urging Trader Joe's to take the lead, visit http://www.meatwithoutdrugs.org.  Halloran adds, "Continuing to sell meat from animals that are routinely fed antibiotics contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance."”Xƒ  Ukraine, the current target of aggressive actions by Russia, was once known as the "Breadbasket of the Soviet Union" due to its significant contributions to the food supply of the U.S.S.R. Despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine remained a productive agricultural nation. However, its overall production of goods and services in 1999 had dropped to 40 percent of what it was in 1991, according to the CIA World Factbook. The country now faces not only a military conflict with Russia but also a potential blow to its agricultural production, as revealed by a report from the Oakland Institute on July 28. The report exposed that under the terms of a $17 billion loan from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Ukraine would be required to allow the use of genetically-modified (GM) crops and organisms in its agriculture. It is worth noting that GMOs are currently prohibited in Ukraine. However, as CounterPunch reports, late in 2013, the then-president Viktor Yanukovych rejected an agreement with the European Union, which was linked to a $17 billion IMF loan. Instead, he opted for an aid package from Russia, including a discount on Russian natural gas. This decision ultimately sparked deadly protests and Yanukovych's removal from office in February of this year. Frederic Mousseau, the Policy Director of the Oakland Institute, highlighted the significance of Article 404 in the EU agreement, which pertains to agriculture and includes a clause promoting cooperation to expand the use of biotechnologies. This provision aligns with the interests of agribusiness companies such as Deere, Monsanto, and DuPont, who see Ukraine and Eastern Europe as promising markets for their products, according to Mousseau. Ukrainian law currently prohibits farmers from cultivating GM crops in the country's fertile black soil, which is ideal for grain production. In 2012, Ukrainian farmers harvested over 20 million tonnes of corn, as reported by CounterPunch. Mousseau also noted that Ukraine's agricultural sector has seen significant growth in the past decade, with an increasing concentration of large corporations using intensive farming methods.”Xê	  FDA Extends Deadline for Public Comment on CAM Guidelines  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has faced significant backlash from the public following the release of proposed CAM Guidelines, which many believed the agency was trying to push through quietly. In response to the criticism, the FDA has extended the deadline for public comment from April 30 to May 29. The CAM Guidelines outline the FDA's plans to regulate a wide range of natural health products, including herbs, functional foods, therapeutic oils, nutritional supplements, and even physical devices like massage rocks. These guidelines have been met with accusations that the FDA is attempting to undermine naturopathy and alternative medicine.  Health freedom attorney Ralph Fucetola, a trustee of the non-profit Natural Solutions Foundation, submitted a petition to the FDA on April 22, requesting an extension for the public comment period. The petition also called for public hearings on the issue, although no decision has been made regarding that request. It appears that the FDA initially tried to introduce the CAM Guidelines discreetly, hoping that the public would not notice until they were already adopted and approved. The original document was quietly posted on the FDA's website the day after Christmas in 2006 but did not appear in the Federal Register until several months later. By the time the natural health community discovered and commented on the guidelines, there were only about 30 days left in the public comment period.  Thanks to public pressure and the Natural Solutions Foundation's petition, the FDA has extended the public comment period by an additional 30 days. So far, the FDA has received over 108,000 comments on their CAM Guidelines, with an additional 267,000 people attempting to post comments but encountering difficulties. Concerns have been raised that comments submitted to the FDA may be intentionally ignored or deleted, and letters sent to the agency regarding this matter are allegedly regularly ignored.  To ensure that your voice is heard on this issue, it is advised to either post your comments electronically or contact your representative in Washington to exert pressure on the FDA from a legislative standpoint. All comments become part of the official FDA record, so it is important to craft them carefully. The Natural Solutions Foundation has also provided a web comment form that uses the 'Democracy In Action' engine to send comments to the FDA and add your name to a petition advocating for health freedom.”X«
  Cancer Rates Remain Higher Among Black Americans, New Statistics Show  Recent statistics released by the American Cancer Society (ACS) reveal that cancer rates continue to be higher among black Americans compared to their white counterparts. The ACS reports that rates among black men are more than one-third higher than whites, while rates for black women are 18 percent higher. In 2007, black Americans are projected to account for nearly 63,000 of the estimated 560,000 cancer-related deaths and 153,000 of the 1.7 million new cancer cases. The ACS website acknowledges that "African Americans have the highest death rate and shortest survival rate of any other racial or ethnic group for most cancers."  Mike Adams, a published author and natural health advocate, has accused the medical profession of misinforming the black population about the benefits of sunlight, which he believes contributes to the higher prevalence of cancer among blacks. Adams argues that "blacks die from skin cancer at rates that far exceed whites because conventional medicine strives to keep black Americans in a state of ignorance concerning the need for sunlight and Vitamin D." He claims that due to dark skin pigmentation, which blocks the synthesis of Vitamin D in the skin, up to 75 percent of blacks are chronically deficient in this anticancer vitamin. Adams asserts that by informing the black population about the importance of sunlight and Vitamin D, millions of black Americans' lives could be saved in the next decade.  The report shows that most forms of cancer are more prevalent in blacks compared to whites on an adjusted scale of rate per 100,000 people. However, there are a few exceptions, including breast cancer, skin cancer, bladder cancer, and leukemia. Overall, cancer rates among blacks have decreased over the past century. Nevertheless, lung cancer rates have increased among black women and are projected to again become the leading cause of death among the combined black population. The report suggests that this increase may be linked to the higher prevalence of smoking menthol cigarettes among blacks. While menthols offer a less harsh inhalation experience, they may pose greater dangers to the human body than regular cigarettes. In 2003, menthol cigarettes accounted for 27 percent of all cigarette sales, with approximately 70 percent of menthol cigarette sales going to blacks.  In conclusion, the statistics released by the ACS underscore the persistently higher cancer rates among black Americans. Efforts to address this disparity should include raising awareness about the benefits of sunlight and Vitamin D, as well as addressing the factors contributing to the increased prevalence of lung cancer among”•B     X-
  Hemp seed oil, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, has recently gained recognition as a "perfect food" due to its well-balanced concentrations of omega fatty acids. Historically, hemp was widely consumed worldwide, as it was one of the first crops to be cultivated and consumed. However, there is a common misconception that hemp contains THC, the psychoactive element of the cannabis plant. This is simply untrue.  While relatively new to the Western Hemisphere, hemp seed oil is now readily available in health-food stores. The seeds of the hemp plant contain a remarkable combination of oils, making it one of the most well-balanced and nutrient-rich sources on the planet. The World Health Organization recommends a 3:1 ratio of Omega 6 to Omega 3 for optimal utilization, and hemp seed oil naturally provides this balance. The essential fatty acids present in these oils play a fundamental role in restoring health and immune function. In fact, hemp seed oil contains an impressive 80 percent essential fatty acids, the highest concentration among all plants.  What sets hemp seed oil apart is its exceptional concentrations of essential fatty acids (EFAs). In theory, this oil could fulfill all of our EFA requirements for life. These essential fatty acids, which the body cannot produce and must be consumed, are renowned for their ability to prevent heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, arthritis, and many other ailments. Dr. Johana Budwig, a seven-time Nobel Prize nominee and pioneer in EFA research, reported success in treating heart infarction, arthritis, cancer, and other common diseases through massive doses of EFAs. These nutrients are also crucial for the proper functioning and development of the brain and nervous system, as well as the production of healthy cell membranes. Additionally, they provide essential nutrients to the hair and skin and support various other bodily functions.  While fish oil supplements have gained popularity as a reliable source of EFAs, particularly Omega 3s, they are not suitable for vegetarians. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the potential contamination of fish oil with mercury and other toxins. Hemp seed oil, on the other hand, presents a great alternative, as it contains Omega 3, 6, and 9, providing the same benefits as fish oil without the risk of ingesting toxins.  Those who use hemp seed oil often report numerous benefits for their hair, skin, and nails. As these three are formed from the same line of dermal cells, it is not surprising that hemp oil can contribute to thicker and shinier hair”X£   A recent study conducted by researchers from Harvard University and published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that consuming a diet high in walnuts may have several benefits for cardiovascular health. The researchers discovered that walnuts, which are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, can lower cholesterol and fight inflammation, two major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  The study analyzed the results of 13 different studies involving a total of 365 participants who consumed between 10 and 24 percent of their calories from walnuts for four to 24 weeks. The findings showed that those on a high-walnut diet experienced significant decreases in total and LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels.  Despite walnuts being high in fat, the researchers found that a high-walnut diet did not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. In fact, they found that it seemed to lower the risk. The researchers also observed that walnuts are a good source of fiber, magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin E, and other antioxidants, which further contribute to their health benefits.  The study's results highlight the need for larger and longer-term trials to fully understand the heart benefits of nut-rich diets. Previous studies have also linked diets high in nuts and berries to a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome, a group of symptoms associated with cardiovascular disease. Additionally, other nuts such as macadamia nuts and almonds have been previously linked to improved cardiovascular health.  In addition to their cardiovascular benefits, diets high in walnuts may also reduce the risk of breast cancer, according to other studies.  Overall, this research provides further evidence of the potential health benefits of incorporating walnuts into one's diet. It emphasizes the importance of considering walnuts as a part of a heart-healthy eating plan and encourages further exploration into the long-term effects of nut-rich diets.”Xª   Police in Plymouth, a city in Britain, have reported a significant increase in their ability to apprehend and prosecute individuals involved in violent crimes by using small digital cameras affixed to officers' helmets. According to the results of a 10-week pilot project, the number of arrests for violent crimes in the test area rose by 85 percent. Furthermore, there was a notable 40 percent rise in the detection of such crimes, along with a 20 percent increase in the arrest and prosecution of suspects. Additionally, police observed an 8 percent decrease in the occurrence of violent crime in the test area.  Detective Superintendent Richard Wood, who oversees a similar initiative in London, emphasized that the cameras' primary advantage lies in facilitating the prosecution of individuals caught committing crimes. "Should anyone commit any offenses," he explained, "the officers will instantly have the evidence to ... pursue criminal charges." The small cameras, which are approximately the size of an AA battery, are attached to the side of officers' helmets and record both audio and video footage of their surroundings. In the London program, these cameras, along with a special utility belt to store the data, cost approximately Â£1,800 ($3,500) per officer.  The Plymouth trial involves around 250 officers wearing the cameras for a period of six months, scheduled to conclude in March. Some of the video footage collected during the first 10 weeks has been made available to the public and can be accessed online. Both the Plymouth and London police departments aim to assess the potential usefulness of these cameras in other parts of the country. These new surveillance programs are part of a broader effort in the United Kingdom to enhance the effectiveness of citizen monitoring. In London, authorities are also experimenting with automated license plate recognition software, increased patrol visibility, and airport-style weapons searches.”X•
  Title: Diagnostic Criteria of DSM-5 Under Scrutiny for Lack of Clarity and Objectivity  In a scathing critique of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), concerns have been raised about the poorly written, vague, and subjective nature of its diagnostic criteria. According to experts, these flaws create a situation where almost anyone, including doctors themselves, could qualify for a variety of mental health diagnoses based on the interpretation employed during the diagnostic process.  One disorder that exemplifies these concerns is schizophrenia, which requires the presence of at least two out of five criteria, with at least one falling within the first three. Additionally, symptoms must persist for a minimum of one month before an official diagnosis can be made. This diagnostic framework, akin to a game show, allows for a significant number of physicians to meet the criteria for schizophrenia on any given day.  The first criterion, delusions, refers to false beliefs that persist despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Examples of such delusions include the misguided notion that medication with severe side effects can improve health or the belief that patients can be adequately served in brief, ten-minute appointments. These delusions also extend to doctors who may erroneously dismiss patients' concerns, attributing them to being "all in their head" or arrogantly assuming godlike authority.  The second criterion, hallucinations, describes perception-like experiences characterized by clarity and impact. However, critics argue that doctors often fail to perceive the full complexity of their patients, instead focusing solely on their symptoms. They overlook the fact that patients are multifaceted individuals with unique histories, desires, emotions, and relationships, reducing them to mere projections of symptoms.  Disorganized speech or incoherence, the third criterion, further highlights the communication challenges doctors face when attempting to explain complex medical information to their patients. This lack of coherence often stems from inadequate communication skills rather than patients' lack of intelligence or understanding.  Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, the fourth criterion, draws attention to cases where doctors exhibit a lack of organization and coherence in their medical practices. Instances of surgeons mistakenly operating on the wrong limb or removing the wrong organs, as well as teams of doctors struggling to collaborate effectively, have been reported, resulting in potentially life-threatening consequences.  Finally, the fifth criterion, negative symptoms such as diminished emotional expression, requires little explanation. Patients have noted a tendency among doctors to become emotionally detached, possibly due to the rigorous training that emphasizes the removal of personal biases and emotions. This phenomenon has led some to lament”XÏ

In the past, this would have raised eyebrows and disqualified him from being considered a true journalist. However, the landscape of American news media has evolved, and it has become common for political operatives to transition seamlessly into media roles while waiting for their next position in a friendly administration.  Stephanopoulos has not officially reentered the Democratic political sphere, but recent revelations have shed light on his activities as a Democratic political operative while posing as a journalist for ABC News. These revelations include significant donations made by Stephanopoulos to the foundation of his former boss, President Clinton. In response, Stephanopoulos offered a mea culpa to viewers, framing his contributions as charitable donations to causes he deeply cares about.  However, it is worth noting that Stephanopoulos failed to disclose these donations to viewers, even when interviewing author Peter Schweizer, who wrote the book "Clinton Cash." This book alleges that donations to the Clinton Foundation may have influenced Hillary Clinton's actions as Secretary of State. The foundation itself has faced scrutiny, with claims that it functions more as a political slush fund than a charitable organization, as a large portion of its funding is spent on administration and salaries rather than charitable causes.  Stephanopoulos' assertion that his donations were specifically for global AIDS prevention and deforestation is not convincing, as the foundation's own tax filings show that only 10 percent of its funding went to charities in 2013. The New York Post reported that the foundation's finances were questionable enough to be placed on a "watch list" by Charity Navigator, a non-partisan organization that monitors such groups.  In light of these revelations, it becomes clear that Stephanopoulos' claims of impartiality and his role as a journalist have come into question. The blurring of the lines between politics and media has become increasingly prevalent, and it is crucial for viewers to be aware of these dynamics when consuming news.”XÉ	  New research conducted by scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health has revealed that X-rays may significantly increase the risk of children developing leukemia. The study suggests that even a single X-ray can moderately increase the chances of certain types of leukemia, raising concerns about the safety of X-rays in general. These findings, part of the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS), a population-based case-control study covering 35 counties in California, shed new light on how continued exposure to low-dose radiation can lead to the development of harmful cancers. Previously, it was widely assumed that X-rays were relatively safe.  Patricia Buffler, a professor of epidemiology at UC Berkeley and the principal investigator of the NCCLS, stated, "The general clinical impression has been that the level of radiation a child would be exposed to today from a conventional X-ray would not confer an additional risk for cancer. The results of our study were not what we expected." According to scientific research, humans are constantly exposed to ionizing radiation, which is responsible for DNA mutations and cell damage, from various sources, including natural ones such as soil and air. However, the daily rate of environmental exposure to ionizing radiation is approximately one-tenth of the amount emitted by a single X-ray, making it less threatening.   Furthermore, modern computed tomography (CT) scans emit hundreds of times more ionizing radiation than X-rays, and many individuals undergo CT scans without being aware of their potential dangers. Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist at UC San Francisco who was not involved in the study, stated, "If even plain film X-rays are associated with an increased risk of leukemia, then one has to wonder about CT scans, some of which can generate 500 times the dose of radiation of an X-ray." Dr. Smith-Bindman also mentioned that X-rays account for two-thirds of the imaging procedures children undergo, with 20% of their overall radiation exposure coming from X-rays and an additional 10% from CT scans.  These findings highlight the need for further research and consideration of the potential risks associated with X-rays and CT scans. As scientists continue to investigate the implications of these findings, it is important to ensure the safety of medical imaging procedures, particularly for children who may be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of radiation exposure.”XÒ
  New Study Suggests Vitamin D Deficiency Among African-Americans May Contribute to Higher Cancer Mortality Rates  A recent study published in the journal Dermato-Endocrinology has shed light on the impact of vitamin D deficiency on cancer mortality rates, particularly among African-Americans. The study confirms that individuals with darker skin pigmentation, including those of Middle Eastern and African descent, have a more difficult time absorbing vitamin D-producing ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun compared to those with lighter skin pigmentation.  Researchers found that a disproportionately high number of primarily African-Americans die from cancer each year due to vitamin D deficiency. The study takes into account factors such as socioeconomic status, stage of diagnosis, treatment options, and other variables that might affect survival rates. After considering these factors, researchers determined that the mortality rate for cancer among African-Americans is up to 30 percent higher compared to others, primarily due to vitamin D deficiency.  Individuals with fair skin tones can produce sufficient amounts of vitamin D from natural sunlight exposure in approximately 15 minutes a day during the summer. However, those with darker skin tones, including blacks and other individuals of African and Middle Eastern descent, require up to six times longer in the sun to produce the same amount. This makes many darker-skinned individuals, especially in North America, more prone to vitamin D deficiency compared to their lighter-skinned counterparts.  Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of chronic illnesses, including specific types of cancer such as bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, rectal, testicular, vaginal, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and melanoma. To combat this issue, it is crucial for individuals of African and Middle Eastern descent to either spend more time in the sun, whenever possible, or supplement with natural vitamin D3 on a daily basis.  William B. Grant, co-author of the study and Director of the Sunlight, Nutrition and Health Research Center, emphasizes the importance of raising vitamin D concentrations to reduce the burden of cancer among African-Americans. Taking 1000-4000 IU of vitamin D3 supplements per day can help achieve optimal vitamin D levels and potentially reduce the risk of not only cancer but also cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, respiratory infections, and other chronic and infectious diseases.  It is worth noting that vitamin D deficiency is not limited to African-Americans alone. A 2011 study found that almost half of the overall population is vitamin D deficient, irrespective of race. However, the groups most severely affected are”X
  New research has raised concerns about the safety of childhood vaccinations and flu shots due to the presence of aluminum, a potential contributor to male infertility. A study conducted by researchers from the UK and France found that higher levels of aluminum in the body were associated with lower sperm count and quality in males. The study, published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology, analyzed semen samples from 62 male patients using a method recommended by the World Health Organization. The researchers hypothesized that environmental pollutants, such as aluminum, could be responsible for the decline in male fertility seen in industrialized nations over the past 60 years. Their study confirmed a direct link between aluminum and damaged male fertility, with participants who had low concentrations of sperm showing higher levels of aluminum in their bodies. The mean aluminum content among all donors was 339 parts per billion, but some donors had levels exceeding 500 ppb, which correlated with the worst quality and quantity of sperm. Professor Christopher Exley, a leading authority on human exposure to aluminum, emphasized the significant increase in aluminum exposure over the past few decades and suggested that aluminum could be a potential contributor to the decline in male fertility. These findings raise concerns for parents, as many childhood vaccines contain aluminum adjuvants. Vaccines currently licensed to contain aluminum adjuvants include aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and potassium aluminum sulfate.”XW
  In the realm of journalism, I, as the editor of selfnews, often find myself in a situation akin to that of Donald Trump. People frequently approach me, urging me to uncover certain stories and expose the truth behind them. My response is typically the same: "Why don't you start your own website and write about it yourself? We will gladly publicize your story." However, the response I receive is consistently uniform. "Oh, I couldn't possibly do that. I would risk losing my job," they say, or they fear an audit from the IRS or being shut down by the FDA. They always have their reasons for refraining from expressing their true beliefs, all the while desiring for me to voice those very sentiments on their behalf. At present, Americans perceive Donald Trump in a similar light. They view him as the hero of the village, equipping him with a sword and thrusting him forward to confront the oncoming dragon. The reason behind this support is Trump's audacity. He is seen as a warrior, unafraid to engage in battles that others desperately seek to avoid. The majority of individuals, in contrast, live with a startling lack of personal fortitude. They are easily intimidated and prefer to maintain the status quo rather than rock the boat by challenging it. They fear going against the grain, speaking the truth in a crowded room, or expressing an obvious fact that contradicts political correctness. (For instance, acknowledging the detrimental effects of vaccines on children or the lethal consequences of chemotherapy for cancer patients.) However, figures like Donald Trump and myself, known as the Health Ranger, have developed a reputation for confronting these issues head-on, speaking out, and fighting for the truth, regardless of the organized and systemic suppression we may face. Consequently, people often turn to us, urging us to voice their concerns and express the ideas they are too apprehensive to articulate themselves. This is why I comprehend, on a profound level, Donald Trump's immense popularity. He is the warrior who is willing to challenge the establishment, which everyone recognizes as being corrupt and deceitful. Trump dares to vocalize the truths that everyone else already believes but is too fearful to utter. "Build a wall! Kick out the illegals!" These sentiments are prevalent, particularly among African-Americans who have been adversely affected by the presence of undocumented immigrants. Yet, few individuals are willing to voice these opinions publicly, fearing condemnation and social ostracization. Donald Trump has become America's surrogate mouthpiece. When he proclaims that politicians are foolish”Xì	  New Study Suggests Drinking Coffee May Reduce Risk of Endometrial Cancer  In a recent study published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, researchers found that consuming up to four cups of coffee per day may reduce the risk of developing cancer of the endometrium, or the lining of the uterus. This latest research provides a glimmer of hope for coffee lovers who may have previously felt guilty about indulging in multiple cups of their favorite beverage.  The study, which analyzed data from nearly half a million women, revealed that drinking approximately 26 to 37 ounces of coffee daily could reduce the risk of endometrial cancer by up to 18 percent. Melissa Merritt, the study's author and a research fellow in cancer epidemiology at Imperial College London, expressed that the results were consistent with previous studies on the topic.  Merritt and her team utilized data from two large ongoing studies and examined the dietary habits of over 2,800 women with endometrial cancer. By comparing their findings with previous research, they were able to establish a clear association between coffee intake and a reduced risk of the disease.  The study did not differentiate between decaf and regular coffee, and therefore could not determine which one is more beneficial. However, Dr. Robert Morgan, a professor of medical oncology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, believes that the study supports previous research that suggests coffee has a positive impact on decreasing the risk of endometrial cancer.  While the exact reason why coffee may help lower the risk of endometrial cancer remains unclear, Merritt suggests that one possible mechanism is that coffee reduces estrogen levels in the body, thereby altering the hormonal balance. The American Cancer Society acknowledges that an increased risk of endometrial cancer is associated with an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone.  It is important to note that this study only identified a link between coffee consumption and a lower risk of endometrial cancer, without establishing a cause-and-effect relationship. Furthermore, the study's findings revealed no consistent association between other dietary factors and the risk of endometrial cancer.  Although more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind coffee's potential benefits, this study provides coffee drinkers with a renewed sense of reassurance. So, go ahead and savor that second, third, or even fourth cup of coffee - it may just be doing your health a favor.”XU	  Radiology Doctors Face Crackdown on Cheating Ahead of Board Certification Exam  The American Board of Radiology (ABR) and several educational institutions are taking action to address concerns over the practice of "recalls," a form of cheating in which radiology doctors memorize board certification test questions and share them with others preparing for the exam. This practice has become increasingly common among those seeking board certification, prompting fears about the integrity of the certification process.  Dr. Matthew Webb, an Army captain trained at the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium (SAUSHEC), recently filed a complaint with ABR regarding the widespread use of recalls. Dr. Webb revealed that cheating had become so prevalent that even his program director had essentially instructed him to use recalls in order to pass the test.  In response to Dr. Webb's complaint, Dr. Gary Becker, executive director of ABR, expressed outrage and stated that the organization had taken the case to its professionalism committee. ABR has announced measures to crack down on recalls and plans to reformat the exam process starting next year.  Dr. Becker maintains that recalls do not pose a threat to patient health since radiologists still undergo extensive training and must pass a rigorous test to become certified. However, Dr. Webb argues that using recalls constitutes a breach of trust to patients and represents a severe violation of academic integrity. He pointed out that cheating would not be tolerated in other educational phases, such as elementary school, high school, undergraduate studies, and graduate studies, so why should radiologists be an exception?  Certain practicing radiologists argue that recalls are simply study guides that assist in the learning process. They highlight that since 50 percent of board certification exam questions change annually, and doctors still need to pass an unrehearsed oral exam, using recalls is a practical way to study complex material. Dr. Joseph Deiber, a radiologist, stated that if the exam focused on relevant radiology knowledge and tested on it, using recalls would be acceptable. He believes that recalls exist in a "gray area" and that many of the questions on the board certification exam are not pertinent to modern radiology practice, which is why recalls are widely utilized as study aids.”X£	  European Union Debates Lifting Ban on Neonicotinoid Pesticides  As the European Union considers whether to lift restrictions on three pesticides in the neonicotinoid family, it would do well to consider the phenomenon, known to Canadian beekeepers, in which bees start dying in droves shortly after corn planting season. In the summer of 2013, beekeeper Dave Schuit reported that millions of his bees died after corn planting began. That same year, Canadian farmer Gary Kenny experienced a similar loss of eight out of ten beehives on his property. Genetically modified (GM) corn is widely planted in Canada, but because the bee deaths occurred just after planting, the corn plants are not likely to blame for this particular die-off. Instead, beekeepers believe the cause is that the corn seeds were pre-treated with neonicotinoids.  According to numerous studies, neonicotinoids are the likely culprit. In a study conducted by researchers from Purdue University, dead bees were found to contain traces of the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Another investigation conducted by the local Pest Management Regulatory Agency also concluded that neonicotinoid-treated corn seeds were responsible for the majority of bee mortalities.  Neonicotinoids are systemic pesticides, applied to seeds prior to planting and absorbed by every part of the plant. This makes them highly lethal to all insects, including agricultural pests, as well as birds that come into contact with the plants. The use of neonicotinoids in agriculture, their persistence in soil and water, and their uptake by plants and translocation to flowers, puts pollinator services at risk, according to an international research study.  Not only are pollinators threatened by neonicotinoids, but two major studies in 2015 found that these pesticides have dangerous effects on entire ecosystems. One study published in the journal Nature found that neonicotinoid use was causing bird populations to decline due to direct poisoning and the devastation of their food sources. Additionally, an analysis by the Task Force on Systemic Pesticides, based on 800 separate studies, concluded that even when used according to manufacturer guidelines, neonicotinoids have negative impacts on "non-target" species such as earthworms, insects, aquatic invertebrates, lizards, and fish. The task force warned that these pesticides are likely to have a wide range of negative biological and ecological impacts.”X±
  Russia has officially banned all imports of genetically modified corn after concerns were raised by a recent study conducted by French researchers. The study revealed that rats developed significant cancer tumors when fed a lifetime of Monsanto's genetically modified corn. Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's consumer protection group, announced the ban and stated that the country's Institute of Nutrition will evaluate the study's results. This ban is another setback for Monsanto, a company that has been clinging to the belief that its genetically modified crops are no different from traditional crops and therefore do not require long-term safety testing.   Monsanto has criticized the French study by claiming that it did not use a sufficient number of rats and that the duration of the study was too short. However, this claim seems unfounded considering that Monsanto's own animal studies only last for 90 days, while the French study examined the effects of rats consuming GM corn (as well as trace amounts of Roundup herbicide) for two years. It is worth noting that the cancer tumors did not appear until the rats reached adulthood.   For over a decade, Monsanto's GM corn has been a part of the U.S. food supply and can be found in many popular breakfast cereals. In addition to the Russian ban, Monsanto may also face a European ban if France's national health agency confirms the findings of the French scientists. Furthermore, if Proposition 37 passes in California, food producers will be required to label GMOs on their products. This is expected to lead to a decline in the use of GMOs in the U.S. as most consumers who are aware of GMOs would refuse to purchase items labeled as containing genetically engineered ingredients.   CRIIGEN.org, an organization dedicated to independent research on genetic engineering, released a statement summarizing the findings of the recent rat study. According to the organization, the implications of the study are extremely serious as they demonstrate the toxicity of both a widely used GMO and herbicide, even at low levels found in water sources. The statement also questions the adequacy of the current regulatory process used worldwide by agencies involved in health, food, and chemicals assessments, as well as industries seeking commercialization of products.   It is important to note that there have been allegations of Monsanto's influence on government regulators and scientists. The company has allegedly provided financial incentives to scientists in the U.S. and has placed individuals with pro-GMO agendas in influential positions in government. The European Union's Food Safety Agency (FSA) also has decision makers with financial ties to genetic engineering seed companies.”X
  New Docu-Series Explores Natural Cures for Cancer  The remarkable success of the Internet-streamed docu-series, The Quest for the Cure, earlier this year has inspired its organizers to launch a new series that delves deeper into the topic of natural cancer cures. Set to pre-launch on September 29 and run until October 12, the actual docu-series will be available for streaming from October 13 to October 24. One of the featured experts in the upcoming series is Dr. Ben Johnson, a highly accomplished physician who holds three medical degrees and is renowned for his unconventional medical techniques, including successfully reversing the effects of Lou Gehrig's disease.  Dr. Johnson's interest in alternative medicines stems from his personal experience with overcoming Lou Gehrig's disease using unconventional methods, as detailed on his website. With over 30 years of medical experience, Dr. Johnson initially began his career in immunopathology in 1976 and has since dedicated his work to promoting health and wellness, particularly in women's breast health.  In 1997, Dr. Johnson pioneered the combination of conventional and complementary medicine in patient treatments. Returning to his home state of Georgia, he founded the Immune Recovery Foundation, a complementary/alternative cancer treatment center located in Atlanta. In 2004, he shifted his focus to breast cancer research and established the International Cancer Foundation in Rossville, Georgia, with a mission to educate women on breast health.  Affectionately known as "Dr. Ben," he has successfully treated numerous women and has become a sought-after medical advisor for healthcare professionals worldwide. In 2003, Dr. Johnson himself was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and, after losing hope in traditional and alternative medical treatments, he discovered relief through the innovative "Healing Codes" created by Alex Loyd. This breakthrough led to his appearance in the bestselling documentary The Secret in 2006 and co-authoring two bestselling books, The Healing Code and The Secret of Health: Breast Wisdom.  Additionally, Dr. Johnson operates Dr. Ben Johnson Services LLC, a business that promotes natural healthcare products and offers breast cancer screening for women. Dedicated to spreading his message of health and wholeness, Dr. Johnson has authored several publications, including Healing Waters in June 2011, and a report on thermography and the health concerns associated with mammography in 2012.

  Left-wing activists advocating for "social justice" have successfully persuaded policymakers on the West Coast to implement regulations that require local businesses to pay their low-skilled workers an excessively high minimum wage, almost twice the federal minimum wage. As expected, many of these businesses are now suffering the consequences. One such casualty is a beloved bookstore that had been operating for nearly two decades. Unfortunately, this will not be the last of such closures. According to the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), San Francisco residents voted to raise the minimum wage in the city to $15 per hour by 2018. This means that shops and businesses are now obliged to pay entry-level workers, who often lack experience, a wage that is typically reserved for more skilled and seasoned employees. Consequently, Borderlands Books has become one of the first businesses in San Francisco to shut down due to this policy, as its owners simply cannot afford to pay the higher mandated wage. The bookstore recently announced, "Borderlands is closing. In our 18 years of business, we have faced numerous challenges. The most impactful was in 2000 when our landlord doubled our rent, leading us to relocate to our current location on Valencia Street. The subsequent challenges have been less straightforward but more difficult. The rise of online shopping, particularly through Amazon, has taken a significant toll on bookstores worldwide, including Borderlands. Additionally, the shift towards ebooks and electronic reading devices has impacted our business. Finally, the Great Recession of 2009 hit us hard, especially considering our recently opened cafÃ©." Despite weathering these challenges, Borderlands Books cannot sustain its operations if it is required to pay employees such a high wage, as it would be unable to generate a profit. As Charles Platt at AEI points out, Borderlands Books managed to survive a 100% rent increase, the effects of the Great Recession, and competition from Amazon, ebooks, and electronic reading devices over several decades. However, they will not be able to withstand the government-mandated minimum wage law endorsed by voters. This law establishes a wage floor that will force bookstores in San Francisco to close down. Borderlands Books is likely not an isolated case; many other bookstores in the city will face a similar fate. In summary, the economic lesson here is that a higher minimum wage leads to maximum sorrow for San Francisco bookstores. Businesses are now confronted with difficult choices, and unfortunately, labor will suffer as a result. The expectation of fewer jobs due to the implementation of a higher government-mandated wage is not a”Xð	  In the quest for flawless skin, many turn to expensive cosmetic products promising miraculous results. However, the truth is that true beauty starts from within. A healthy diet plays a crucial role in enhancing the skin's natural glow. By incorporating certain foods into your daily meals, you can nourish your skin from the inside out and experience both physical and aesthetic benefits. Here are some key foods to consider adding to your diet.  Chia Seeds: Originating from the Aztec word for oily, chia seeds offer a plethora of health benefits. These tiny seeds are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for the body's well-being but are only found in a limited number of dietary sources. Omega-3s are crucial for maintaining healthy circulation and preventing dry skin. Their absence can lead to various problems such as heart issues, fatigue, depression, and mental fog. Chia seeds are also hydrophilic, meaning they can absorb more than ten times their weight in water. This quality helps keep both the skin and the entire body hydrated. Incorporate chia seeds into your meals by sprinkling them on your hot cereal, adding a teaspoon to your juice, or using them to add texture to salads and vegetable dishes.  Almonds: Not only are almonds a delicious snack, but they also offer numerous benefits for your skin. Rich in vitamin E, almonds help counteract the negative effects of sun exposure and provide protection against certain types of skin cancer. Furthermore, these nuts are a quick source of energy, making them ideal for fueling your exercise routine. Almond skins, in particular, boast high levels of antioxidants that can benefit your skin. Including almonds in your diet is as simple as enjoying them as a snack or incorporating them into your meals.  Dandelions: Don't underestimate the power of dandelions just because they are often considered pesky weeds. Dandelions have incredible health benefits, especially when it comes to cleansing the liver. An overburdened liver can impact the bloodstream, leading to skin issues such as breakouts and premature aging. Dandelion greens are particularly rich in vitamins A, B, and C, as well as copper and zinc â€“ all vital for maintaining healthy skin. Think of dandelions as a dietary equivalent to a refreshing face mask. You can easily grow or forage for dandelions, making them a budget-friendly addition to your meals. Harvest the greens during spring and early summer and use them in salads or juice them. In early fall, gather dandelion roots, chop and dry”XÐ	  Mass Extinction Looms as Marine Life Suffers on Pacific West Coast  The Pacific West Coast is in the grips of a devastating mass extinction event, as an alarming number of marine species continue to wash ashore. Disturbing reports of ailing seals, dead fish, and missing pelicans have left scientists perplexed as they grapple to understand the inexplicable demise of entire marine ecosystems. California, in particular, has witnessed a surge in marine casualties, with an unprecedented number of distressed baby sea lions washing ashore. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reveals that, for the second consecutive year, record numbers of baby sea lions are experiencing difficulties surviving after being abandoned by their mothers due to a scarcity of food. The Marine Mammal Center near San Francisco admitted a staggering 367 California sea lions between January and May, nearly five times the typical average. Southern California has also seen an alarming spike, with over 600 sea lions taken in this year, double the usual number. This follows the treatment of 1,600 sea lions in 2014.  Shawn Johnson, director of veterinary science at the Marine Mammal Center, warns that the sea lions' plight is indicative of a larger issue afflicting the ocean, as they rely on the same resources as humans do. Further north, orcas and beluga whales are experiencing similar declines. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) attributes the population decline of both species to widespread pollution resulting from oil and gas drilling over the past few decades. Meanwhile, along the Alaskan coast, more than 250 Alaskan ice seals have succumbed to a mysterious disease, often fatal. Experts speculate that toxic algal growth, a consequence of excessive sun exposure due to ongoing ozone depletion, may be to blame. The federal government has declared 38 "unusual mortality events" affecting marine mammal species since 2003, nearly double the number recorded from 1991 to 2002, when these animals enjoyed greater federal protection, as reported by Jim Carlton in WSJ.  On the opposite side of the country, Florida's Indian River Lagoon witnessed hundreds of stranded manatees and approximately 80 bottlenose dolphins between 2012 and 2013. In 2013, South Carolina experienced the death of as many as 40,000 six to eight-inch-long menhaden fish along its shores, just a week after a similar incident occurred on North Carolina's Masonboro Island. A year earlier, thousands of starfish washed up on the same”X•
  As the value of the American dollar continues to decline rapidly, individuals are increasingly seeking a secure place to safeguard their savings. In previous articles, I have emphasized the importance of allocating a portion of one's savings to gold and silver coins. The recommended percentage varies from 10% to 50%, depending on the source. These discussions caught the attention of Peter Ragnar, a notable author, speaker, and anti-aging expert affiliated with Roaring Lion Publishing.  Peter Ragnar, an enigmatic figure whose age remains unknown, operates at a level of self-mastery that few achieve. Engaging with him in person or over the phone reveals an extraordinary individual who transcends the typical human experience. Over the years, I have closely followed Peter's work, admiring his expertise in areas such as wild foods, anti-aging techniques, and physical strength. He imparts his knowledge through his books available on his website, Roaring Lion Publishing.  When I discovered that Peter had established a gold minting company, I was initially taken aback. However, upon reflection, it became clear that this venture aligned with his commitment to longevity. If one intends to live a long life, it is essential to surround oneself with valuable metals from Mother Earth, fostering a sense of abundance. This philosophy underpins Golden Lion Mint, the company Peter founded, which emphasizes abundance rather than fear.  Golden Lion Mint (www.GoldenLionMint.com) operates on a sound financial philosophy centered around safety. The company offers gold and silver bullion bars imprinted with symbols of abundance and protection personally selected by Peter. While the prices for these bars are approximately 14% to 15% higher than the market rate, there are compelling reasons to consider acquiring them through Golden Lion Mint.  Firstly, the gold and silver bars you purchase are physically yours to keep. Unlike buying a mere certificate of gold, you acquire genuine, pure commodities that rank among the highest quality available. The gold bars boast a purity level of four nines, while the silver ones have three nines.  Additionally, Golden Lion Mint ensures the confidentiality of your purchase. They do not request your social security number and refrain from storing your credit card details or any other private information. Your ownership and possession of these precious metals remain a secret, known to no one, not even the government. Furthermore, the company has recently introduced gold and silver rounds, which resemble coins but are not considered official U.S. currency. Consequently, they are exempt from confiscation, rendering them a safer alternative to official U.S.”Xu
  Video Compilation of Mock Mass Shooting Event Challenges Gun-Free Zones  A video compilation capturing the recent mock mass shooting event near the University of Texas-Austin campus, organized by Come and Take It Texas, a gun-rights group, has been released online. The purpose of the event was to shed light on the argument that "gun-free zones" only lead to more mass murders and make people less safe. The video, skillfully edited and accompanied by music, opens with an interview on Fox News featuring Matthew Short, one of the event's organizers, who explains the protest's objectives. Short emphasizes the need to end gun-free zones in America, asserting that "95 percent of mass shootings actually happen in gun-free zones." He argues that Americans have an inalienable right to bear arms in order to protect themselves, their property, and their families.  Produced by TalkNetwork.com, a new online talk radio network, the video captures the entire event, including footage of the antics of the counter-protestors, who were seen carrying dildos and using fart noisemakers. The video also highlights the fact that TalkNetwork scooped the mainstream media in covering the mock shooting event, as they were unable to locate it before it took place. This demonstrates that shootings can occur in unexpected or unanticipated locations due to the prevalence of gun-free zones. The media's focus on the antics of the counter-protestors caused them to miss much of the actual event.  Mike Adams, the Health Ranger and co-founder of TalkNetwork.com, emphasized the irony of the mainstream media's distraction during the event. He compared the media's easily-distracted reporters to terrorists and psychotic shooters who strike randomly, stating that the Don't Comply gun rights activists strategically organized the mock mass shooting several blocks away from the oblivious mainstream media. Adams reported that the media was preoccupied with interviewing "fart protesters" and leftist demonstrators waving dildos, dismissing the Don't Comply group's demonstration as "insensitive." Meanwhile, the mock shooters were able to carry out their crime and escape to another location to commit mass murder.  Short criticized the media's failure to focus on the actual event. He noted that the first "murder" occurred while the press was distracted, engrossed in conversations about feelings and opinions on gun-free zones. Short argues that the only way to prevent such incidents is by exercising Second Amendment rights and arming oneself. He pointed out that the police arrived after the crime had already been committed, despite there being witnesses present during the event.  The”Xð
  Honey, often referred to as "liquid gold," is a treasure trove of vitamins and minerals. It not only offers a natural and healthier alternative to sugar for sweetening purposes, but also possesses the ability to combat bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Moreover, honey has been found to lower cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation. However, in order to fully enjoy these benefits, it is crucial to purchase local and organic honey, sourced directly from bees rather than factories.  Startlingly, more than 75 percent of honey sold in American grocery stores is not authentic honey, as reported by Food Safety News. In an extensive investigation, they sent over 60 different jars of honey from 10 states and the District of Columbia to Vaughn Bryant, a distinguished melissopalynologist and professor at Texas A&M University. The findings revealed a distressing prevalence of counterfeit Indian or Chinese honey flooding the market, which is banned in Europe due to safety concerns. This imitation honey is often contaminated with antibiotics or heavy metals and lacks any trace of pollen. The FDA emphasizes that "any product that's been ultra-filtered and no longer contains pollen isn't honey." Yet, this issue persists, as processed honey devoid of beneficial properties continues to be sold in grocery stores throughout the United States.  In the conventional honey-making process, honey is filtered to remove unwanted impurities, such as bee parts and waxes. This filtration step is necessary and widely accepted, as consumers understandably do not wish to encounter such elements in their honey. However, ultra-filtration, a sophisticated technique developed by the Chinese, takes this process to an extreme. Through high-pressure filtration using fine filters, honey is heated and stripped of not only contaminants but also pollen, along with numerous vitamins, minerals, and enzymes that contribute to its health benefits. It is puzzling why companies invest in expensive filtration procedures that result in an inferior product stripped of its natural nutrients. "Removal of all pollen from honey 'makes no sense' and is completely contrary to marketing the highest quality product possible," Mark Jensen, the president of the American Honey Producers Association, told Food Safety News.  China, notorious for producing cheap honey diluted with inexpensive sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup, has faced numerous bans from countries due to frequent contamination with antibiotics and heavy metals. Following significant scandals, the United States levied higher taxes on Chinese honey, hoping to encourage domestic companies to purchase authentic honey produced within the country. Nevertheless, this has not deterred Chinese honey producers, as they now engage in honey laundering. By”X7	  In a recent study published in the prestigious journal Lancet, researchers from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have suggested that drugging individuals with "pre-diabetes" may be an effective way to prevent the onset of diabetes. The study, which aimed to compare the effectiveness of various treatment protocols in preventing diabetes, found that individuals with normal blood sugar levels were less likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to those with elevated blood sugar levels.  The study included 1,990 participants who were part of the larger Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study. Among this group, 736 participants were assigned to "intensive lifestyle intervention," 647 were given metformin, a blood glucose drug, and 607 received a placebo. In the end, those who successfully returned to normal glucose regulation from all groups were found to be 56 percent less likely to develop diabetes.  However, the study raises concerns about the effectiveness of "intensive lifestyle intervention" in preventing diabetes. The term is not clearly defined in the study, leaving uncertainty about the actual dietary and lifestyle changes made by participants. For example, it is unclear whether participants in the lifestyle change group avoided consuming high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which has been shown to aggravate diabetes. The study also fails to specify whether participants in this group followed a diet that included blood sugar-regulating foods like non-irradiated cinnamon and cayenne pepper, while avoiding refined grains, processed foods, and excess sugars.  These details are crucial in determining the effectiveness of any "intensive lifestyle intervention" as conventional approaches often conflict with real-life approaches that actually work. Without a clear definition of what this intervention entails, it is difficult to determine if drugs, such as metformin, are truly more effective in preventing diabetes than lifestyle and dietary changes.  While the study suggests that drugging individuals with pre-diabetes may be a viable option, it is important to consider the potential side effects and long-term implications of relying on medication rather than lifestyle changes. Further research is needed to better understand the optimal approach for preventing diabetes and whether drugs should be the preferred option.”X
  Infant formula has long been associated with an increased risk of severe childhood diseases, including potentially fatal conditions. This connection has been established through numerous epidemiological studies. But what is truly puzzling is the presence of chemicals such as Cupric sulfate â€“ a known pesticide, herbicide, and fungicide â€“ in baby and infant formulas (1,4,5,6,7).  Cupric sulfate is an inorganic salt that finds extensive use in various industries, agriculture, and veterinary medicine (2). It is employed in copperplating, dyeing, wet-cell batteries, pigments, and algicides (1). However, the presence of this chemical in baby formula raises serious concerns. It is clearly listed as an ingredient in several popular baby food formulas, including Enfamil, Similac, and Earth's Best Organic (3,4,5,6). It can even be found in widely consumed vitamins like Centrum and One-a-Day.  Research has linked cupric sulfate to a range of negative health conditions, including arsenic poisoning, DNA damage, heavy metal toxicity, and mercury poisoning. Interestingly, much of this research dates back to as early as 1991, begging the question of why companies continue to allow this chemical in consumer products, especially in baby formulas. The risks associated with cupric sulfate are concerning, as outlined in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS): it is hazardous upon skin contact (irritant), eye contact (irritant), ingestion, and inhalation. The substance may also be toxic to kidneys and liver, with repeated or prolonged exposure leading to organ damage (7).  Moreover, the precautions outlined in the MSDS suggest that cupric sulfate should not be ingested or inhaled, and protective clothing should be worn to avoid skin and eye contact (7). Drugs.com further emphasizes that cupric sulfate is exclusively intended for animal use and should be kept away from children (8). Additionally, acute doses of cupric sulfate have been found to reduce the gastric mucosal barrier capacity, independent of gastrointestinal symptoms (9). Studies have also shown that heavy metal accumulation and associated biochemical alterations are present in individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (10).  In light of these concerning findings, it is essential to consider breastfeeding as the best option for infant nutrition. Mother's colostrum, the first milk produced after giving birth, is rich in nutrients and contains antibodies that protect the nursing baby. Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of allergic and respiratory diseases (11). Breast milk is the optimal”XJ
  Beta radiation levels at monitoring sites across North America have reached unprecedented levels, according to recent reports. However, experts are attributing these spikes to various factors, excluding Fukushima. Data collected from tracking units in California, Arizona, Illinois, and other locations indicate radiation levels up to 50,000 percent higher than those observed at the same time last year and, in some cases, compared to levels seen this past summer. These impacted sites are not limited to the West Coast but are scattered throughout the country, as revealed by readings taken near Los Angeles, Chicago, Montgomery, Alabama, and Madison, Wisconsin.  The readings, reported by EnviroReporter.com, show total beta counts per minute (CPM) far exceeding the government's threshold of 1,000 CPM, which is considered problematic. For example, Tucson, Arizona recently recorded a reading of 460 CPM, more than 10 times higher than last year's reading on November 27. Similarly, Phoenix, Arizona's reading of 735 CPM was over 21 times higher than the previous year's reading. San Diego appears to have been hit the hardest, with a CPM reading of 650 as of October 1. This figure is 60 times higher than the same date last year, despite San Diego's typical background radiation rate hovering around 20 CPM.  According to EnviroReporter.com, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's RadNet radiation monitors have detected increased levels of dangerous beta radiation across the country. The website's most recent comprehensive assessment notes that over a dozen metropolitan test sites have recorded the highest levels in four months. One reader of EnviroReporter.com described these readings as "astronomically high" but dismissed Fukushima as a potential cause unless "something there has changed dramatically." Nevertheless, the detected radiation levels remain a significant cause for concern. The California Highway Patrol considers anything above 100 CPM to be a potential hazardous materials situation requiring hazmat protocols.  At a testing site near Chicago, located in St. Charles, Illinois, a recent peak reading of 7,298 CPM caught the attention of environmental activists, who criticized the media for not addressing the issue. This reading represents an almost 7,300 percent increase in radiation beyond the safety threshold set by the California Highway Patrol. The site experienced a series of massive radiation spikes lasting up to six hours, beginning around 1:00 am.  In California, officials in San Mateo County recorded radiation levels at a local beach that measured 100 micro-REM per hour, or 1 micro”X´	  Continuing our investigative report on hoodia gordonii, a natural appetite suppressant, we now delve into the complex issue of appetite control and its impact on weight loss. (For those who missed the first part, click here to catch up.) For most individuals, the true challenge of shedding pounds lies not in dieting, exercise, supplements, or calorie burn at the gym. Instead, it lies in mastering control over their insatiable hunger. Those striving to lose weight often face a shared obstacle: an inability to rein in their appetite. It's not a matter of laziness, slovenliness, or constant indulgence in junk food. Rather, it's an ongoing struggle to manage their desire for sustenance. This is where hoodia gordonii comes into play, potentially offering a solution to this seemingly insurmountable task. After all, conquering one's innate hunger drive can feel nearly impossible without a helping hand. Consider this: during your previous attempts to shed weight, what ultimately caused you to give in? I wager it was hunger. At some point, cravings overwhelmed you, and you found yourself giving in to food once again. Allow me to share a secret: you can't fight against Mother Nature. Your body was designed for survival. And to survive, your body requires ample calories. The more, the better. Remember, your body was built for an era when calories were scarce. Your body possessed an intrinsic motivation to seek out sustenance. In a time of food scarcity, those who consumed more calories fared better than those who didn't, passing down their genes to future generations. Centuries of this pattern led us to where we are today. We inhabit bodies that were crafted to scrounge for calories in the natural environment. Hunger served as the driving force behind this motivation. "Go find me some berries!" it cried. "Bring me some animal fat!" It's no coincidence that animal fat and sugar rank among the most sought-after comfort foods. They are rich in calories and convince your body that it has an ample food supply. It's no wonder that ice cream acts as a balm for the famished, composed primarily of milk fat and sugar â€“ precisely the elements that trigger a sense of consolation. Yet, in our modern society, we are surrounded by an excess of food. We encounter all-you-can-eat buffets, Costco-sized food packages, and supersized fast food options. Restaurants now serve individuals portions that would have once fed an entire family just a couple of generations ago.”X=
  The original article that was previously published on this platform has been removed due to a misalignment with our science-based investigative mission. In recent years, Mike Adams, also known as the Health Ranger and editor of this publication, has transitioned from being an outspoken activist to becoming an environmental scientist. He now oversees the selfnews Forensic Food Lab, where he conducts top-notch food science research and publishes scientific papers on food contaminants and nutritional analytics. Through rigorous scientific inquiry and the use of advanced analytical instruments typically found in universities, Adams has discovered that, like many others, he has been exposed to toxic elements in the food supply over the past few years. This exposure includes both conventional and organic foods, as well as so-called "superfoods." His findings, which include breakthrough discoveries about food toxicology, the protective qualities of certain nutrients, and the cognitive effects of food contaminants, are now being shared on selfnews.com.  Adams has found that exposure to toxic elements in foods has had a profound impact on his mindset, outlook on life, and overall happiness. He explains, "I now understand that my perception of the world was being negatively influenced by toxic elements present not only in everyday foods, but also in some superfoods and dietary supplements." In 2013, Adams dedicated a significant amount of time to meticulously testing his food intake for the presence of toxic elements and then took steps to rid his body of these toxins. After about six months of intensive detoxification, he experienced a sudden and involuntary shift in his worldview. Fear was replaced by a sense of tranquility, uncertainty gave way to inspiration, and he felt a newfound sense of awakening and optimism. This transformation led Adams to pursue scientific investigations and analytical chemistry. He spent six months immersing himself in university-level chemistry and learning about atomic spectroscopy, a technology used to quantitatively assess metals, minerals, toxic elements, and radioactive isotopes found in various substances, including foods, beverages, soils, and physical matter.  By the end of 2013, Adams had completed extensive training in laboratory instruments and advanced chemistry. He now operates an ICP-MS atomic spectroscopy instrument, which allows him to conduct cutting-edge research on foods, beverages, and personal care products, such as cosmetics. This instrument is capable of detecting toxic elements at concentrations as low as parts per trillion. Adams' current research not only focuses on toxic elements but also delves into the radioactive contamination of the food supply resulting from nearly seven decades of atomic bomb testing. He has undertaken extensive research on the radioactive contamination of”•Ë      X@
  Recent storms in California have wreaked havoc, causing flooding, mudslides, and even a tornado in Los Angeles. While the rainfall on December 10 broke records, it did little to alleviate the state's severe drought. A milder storm on December 12 added to the rainfall, but the combined amount of water left behind, 166 billion gallons, is only enough to sustain 2.5 million people for a year. With a population of over 38 million, it is clear that California's water problems are far from over.  According to the California Department of Water Resources, the state will need six more major winter storms with similar amounts of rain to finally bring an end to the drought. James Eklund, director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board, is not willing to wait and see if those storms come. He is already working on policies to address the water situation not just for now, but for decades to come.  The Colorado River plays a crucial role in water management for the western states. As the snow melts in the spring, about 4.6 trillion gallons of water flow downstream to Arizona, Nevada, Mexico, and California. The 1922 Colorado River Compact dictates that two-thirds of the snowmelt-generated water belongs to the Lower Basin states, while one-third belongs to the Upper Basin states. Eklund's focus is on ensuring that any excess water generated in Colorado remains in the state, without depriving the Lower Basin states of their share.  Looking ahead, Colorado's population is projected to grow from 5.5 million to around 9 million by 2050. This population increase will result in a 60 percent rise in water usage over the next 35 years. The state has already experienced drought in the past, which led to the development of a water management plan. However, the plan does not currently address the contentious issue of transporting 163 billion gallons of water from west of the Continental Divide to the more densely populated Front Range in the east. The new plan does call for considering conservation and recycling options before constructing additional pipelines, a topic that all states should be considering.  In California, agriculture accounts for 80 percent of water usage, despite contributing less than 2.5 percent to the state's income. These figures highlight the need for comprehensive water management strategies and alternative solutions to ensure the state's water resources are used efficiently.  As both California and Colorado grapple with ongoing water woes, it is clear that addressing these challenges requires proactive measures and long-term planning. The urgency to secure water resources and”X¡
  Prescription of Powerful Antipsychotic Drugs Surges Among Children with Behavioral Disorders  In a concerning trend, psychiatrists are increasingly prescribing potent and hazardous antipsychotic medications to children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral disorders. The use of these medications for "off-label" purposes poses severe risks, far outweighing the behavioral problems they are meant to address. These antipsychotics, known as "atypical" or second-generation drugs, have only been on the market since the 1990s and are typically prescribed to adults suffering from severe mental disorders like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Disturbingly, a recent study reveals that the number of children receiving antipsychotics has escalated seven-fold over an eight-year period. Moreover, adolescents are also experiencing a rise in antipsychotic prescriptions.  While the study indicates a general increase in antipsychotic usage across all age groups, it highlights particularly high rates among children and adolescents. Alarmingly, many of these prescriptions are not being written by specialized psychiatrists, but by general practitioners lacking specific training in behavioral, cognitive, or mental disorders. The reasons behind the skyrocketing numbers of antipsychotics prescribed for children with behavioral disorders are multifaceted. These drugs show significant improvement in mitigating hyperactivity, irritability, and defiance associated with ADHD. However, the apparent improvement stems from the fact that these atypical antipsychotics affect the frontal lobe of the brain, an area also targeted in lobotomies. Dr. Peter Breggin, a staunch critic of antipsychotic use in children, asserts, "We have a national catastrophe. This is a situation where we have ruined the brains of millions of children... These are lobotomizing drugs. Of course, they will reduce all behavior, including irritability."  The increased reliance on medication has supplanted potentially more effective treatments such as therapy and family counseling, as the study reveals that the children included did not receive either. The medical industry is favoring the expedient yet riskier solution for younger patients. Transforming children with disruptive behaviors into chemically lobotomized individuals is not the sole peril associated with these drugs. Atypical antipsychotics are notorious for their array of hazardous side effects, which children are especially vulnerable to. These include rapid weight gain, elevated blood pressure, metabolic abnormalities, and a range of troubling neurological effects. Notably, atypical antipsychotics have been linked to Tardive Dyskinesia, a”X
  In the United States, more than 8 billion chickens are raised for meat each year, a staggering figure that reflects the demand for affordable poultry. However, the methods employed by some chicken producers have come under scrutiny, as concerns about inhumane conditions in factory farms continue to mount. While certain companies claim to prioritize the welfare of their chickens by providing free-range and humane conditions, a recent investigation reveals that not all labels can be trusted.  Perdue, the third largest chicken producer in the country, prides itself on being one of the most ethical players in the industry. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Perdue's chickens are "humanely raised," a claim that is reinforced by the company's collaboration with the USDA to create verification programs. As a result, Perdue became the first poultry company to receive the USDA Process Verified Seal.  However, a whistleblower has shed light on a disturbing reality behind Perdue's claims of humane practices. Craig Watts, a contractor for Perdue farms, has revealed the true conditions in which the company's chickens are raised. Watts, a seasoned veteran in the industry, was appalled by the terrible treatment of the birds and decided to expose Perdue's practices. He reached out to Compassion in World Farming, a renowned farm animal welfare organization, to document the conditions.  What the video captured is truly disturbing. It reveals that Perdue's "humanely raised" birds are bred to grow unnaturally large and fast, to the point where they struggle to support their own weight in their final days. While traditional breeds take 80 to 120 days to reach market weight, Perdue's birds are forced to do so in just 42 days, resulting in severe physical distress. Additionally, these supposedly free-range animals are confined in overcrowded warehouses, devoid of natural light and fresh air. With more than 30,000 birds crammed together, the lack of space leads to weak legs and limited mobility. Many of the birds are unable to walk and suffer greatly as a result. Furthermore, they are forced to live in their own waste, as the litter is rarely changed between flocks. By the end of the market cycle, the birds are left panting and immobile, trapped in a bed of feces.  Perdue has attempted to shift blame onto Watts and its contractors for the inhumane conditions. However, this response has only further damaged the company's reputation. While Americans are already disapproving of factory-farmed chickens, they are even more outraged when a”XÅ	  Reishi mushrooms, also known as Ganoderma lucidum, have long been revered by Chinese and Japanese health practitioners as a powerful medicinal herb. In Eastern cultures, it has even been regarded as the key to immortality among royalty. While the Western world is just beginning to explore its true healing potential, researchers have already amassed a wealth of data demonstrating its ability to extend life.  Studies conducted on laboratory mice have shown that reishi can increase their lifespan by 9% to 20%, which is equivalent to about 7 to 16 human years. But reishi's benefits extend far beyond longevity. It has been found to rejuvenate brain neurons, eliminate cancer cells, and inhibit the growth of new fat cells in obese individuals. With dozens of natural bio-active compounds, reishi has the potential to treat a wide range of harmful conditions, including allergies, autoimmune diseases, asthma, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and liver diseases.  So what makes reishi so appealing for overall health? Unlike other treatments that target specific areas of the body, reishi has a much broader impact. Aging and disease are not caused by a single factor, but rather a combination of various factors. Therefore, in order to reverse these effects, a multi-targeted approach is necessary. Reishi's power lies in its hundreds of biologically active molecules working together in synergy.  Researchers have identified three main components of reishi that are essential for its anti-aging properties. Polysaccharides help boost the immune system and prevent cancer. Triterpenes protect the liver, lower cholesterol levels, and stabilize blood pressure. Ganoderma lucidum peptide acts as a powerful antioxidant. Together, these components provide optimal protection at the cellular and DNA level.  In a study involving human participants, doses of 1100 mg of reishi mushrooms were given to healthy individuals. The researchers observed a rapid increase in plasma antioxidant levels, peaking after approximately 90 minutes. After just 3 hours, urine antioxidant capacity had increased by 29%. Importantly, no toxicity or side effects were reported at the end of the study.  Reishi, or ganoderma lucidum, can be taken orally through supplements or even as a coffee product. However, it is crucial to ensure the quality and purity of the product before making a purchase. Reishi is truly a wonderful gift from life, offering a multitude of health benefits that can enhance overall well-being.”XL	  In his first campaign for president, former Senator Barack Obama promised a level of transparency in government that had never been seen before. After being elected to his first term, President Obama issued a memorandum to the federal bureaucracy emphasizing the importance of openness and public trust. However, despite his proclamations, it is clear that true government transparency is often achieved through external factors such as whistleblowers and the media.  While the media has frequently given President Obama a pass in key political battles, there have been instances where the Fourth Estate has attempted to hold his administration accountable. Unfortunately, the price for this has been high, as the Obama administration has been found to have spied on the media, confiscated phone records, and even attempted to prosecute members of the press. These actions paint a different picture from the one President Obama presented in his proclamation.  In fact, the Obama administration has a record of prosecuting whistleblowers more aggressively than any previous administration. As of 2011, the administration had already prosecuted more national security leakers than all previous presidencies combined, with a total of eight cases. This is a concerning trend, as historically, sentencing in media leak cases has been relatively light due to concerns about press freedom. However, under President Obama, the severity of sentencing has increased significantly. The administration has secured 526 months of prison time for national security leakers, compared to only 24 months for all other cases since the American Revolution.  It is worth noting that the majority of this prison time is attributed to the 35-year sentence handed down to Chelsea Manning. The list of pre-Obama national security prosecutions and sentences includes notable cases such as Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo, who were charged with leaking the Pentagon Papers in 1973. However, these charges were dropped amidst political scandal within the Nixon Administration.  The Obama administration's track record in terms of government transparency and handling of whistleblowers raises important questions about the reality of its commitment to openness. While President Obama's words may have promised an unprecedented level of transparency, the actions of his administration tell a different story.”XË
  Children More Likely to Choose Cereal with Cartoon Characters, Study Finds  A recent study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania has confirmed what many parents have already suspected: children are more likely to choose and enjoy eating cereal if there is a licensed cartoon character on the box. However, the study also revealed an interesting trend - when there are no cartoon characters on the box, kids are more likely to choose cereal that is labeled as healthy.  Keri Gans, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, commented on the findings, stating, "This tells us what we've probably already guessed: that young children are going to be more likely to enjoy their cereal if it has one of their favorite characters on it."  The researchers were surprised to discover that children in the study were more likely to avoid cereal with the word "sugar" in the title. Matt Lapierre, one of the authors of the study, suggests that this could be due to the negative association children have with sugar. In response, cereal manufacturers have started removing the word "sugar" from their labels and replacing it with words like "honey" or "golden," even though the sugar content remains the same as before.  The researchers provided two potential explanations for this finding. First, they believe that children are commonly taught from a young age that sugary foods are bad and should be avoided. As a result, children may be less enthusiastic about cereal with "sugar" in the name due to these negative associations. Secondly, the researchers noted that in their survey of cereals marketed to children, none of them included the word "sugar" in the title, despite many using names that imply a sweet taste.  While the children in the study initially seemed motivated to choose healthier cereal options, their preference was easily overridden when their favorite cartoon characters appeared on the box. Food manufacturers clearly capitalize on this preference to sell their products. This raises the question: what can parents do to combat this influence?  One suggestion is to educate children about how advertising can influence their decisions. While this may not always be effective, it plants a seed that can help children make more informed choices later in life. Additionally, keeping a variety of healthy, unprocessed foods available can ensure that children have other options besides sugary cereals. Children who consume balanced, whole foods are less likely to develop strong cravings for junk food.  In conclusion, the University of Pennsylvania study sheds light on the influence of cartoon characters on children's cereal choices. While children may initially be motivated to choose healthier options, the presence of their favorite”XÑ	  Most readers of selfnews are well aware of the numerous health benefits of vitamin D3, extending beyond its commonly known role in maintaining bone health. However, determining the appropriate amount of vitamin D3 intake remains a subject of controversy. Adding to the confusion is the concern about excessive vitamin D3 intake leading to toxicity. It is generally believed that vitamin D3 toxicity resulting from exposure to sunlight or UVB tanning beds is highly unlikely. The process by which UVB rays convert epidermal cholesterol into the precursor of vitamin D3, called cholicalciferol, is self-regulating. If too much vitamin D3 accumulates in the blood, this process slows down or stops. Cholicalciferol is then converted into the active hormone calcitriol through a two-stage process involving the liver and kidneys. Even large doses of vitamin D3 supplements rarely cause toxicity. However, due to the fat-soluble nature of these supplements, the toxic effects can persist for a longer duration compared to other toxic events. That being said, only three cases of vitamin D toxicity have been recorded, and they involved daily supplementation of over 40,000 IUs (international units). Most medical professionals and nutrition experts recommend getting 25(OH)D testing done to determine vitamin D3 blood levels while supplementing with 1000 to 5000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily. Vitamin D3 supplements typically contain cholicalciferol derived from sheep's wool lanolin after shearing. These supplements encapsulate the cholicalciferol that is normally produced when UVB rays interact with a form of cholesterol in our skin. The convenience of supplements bypasses the body's natural safeguard mechanism that limits the conversion of UVB rays to cholicalciferol, which is then used by the liver and kidneys to produce vitamin D3. However, it is worth noting that vitamin D toxicity is extremely rare. A recent study conducted by Washington University, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on May 1, 2012, by Dr. Ian de Boer, suggested a lower threshold for vitamin D3 blood levels than what is commonly recommended. The study analyzed stored blood samples from older adults who had participated in a nationwide cardiovascular health study between 1992 and 2006. The researchers followed up on major medical events experienced by these individuals and compared them to their vitamin D3 blood levels. The study, which involved 1,621 senior citizens, concluded that a blood serum level of 20 ng/ml (nano-”X	  New research published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology is adding to the mounting evidence that high doses of statins, the drugs commonly prescribed to treat high cholesterol, may lead to liver damage. The study analyzed data from 23 large clinical trials and found that high-dose statins were associated with 2.4 times as many cases of liver damage compared to low-dose statins. Specifically, for every 100,000 patients, there were 271 cases of liver damage linked to high-dose statins.  The researchers also examined the individual statin drugs and found that Zocor (simvastatin) was 1.6 times more dangerous in high doses than low doses, while Lipitor (atorvastatin) was a staggering 4.0 times more dangerous. These findings are consistent with previous studies, including one published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which reported a 5.5 higher risk of liver damage from maximum-dose Lipitor compared to a lower dose. Another study in the same journal revealed that maximum-dose Lipitor was 4.5 times more likely to cause liver damage than a placebo.  Although most cases of liver damage from statins are minor and reversible, some can be severe or potentially fatal. In fact, the studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that despite preventing heart attacks and strokes, maximum-dose Lipitor did not decrease mortality in patients taking it due to increased mortality from other causes, such as cancer.  Interestingly, the recent study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology also discovered that rates of cancer among statin users increased as both LDL and total cholesterol levels decreased. Additionally, the risk of cancer rose along with the dose of statins being taken. As a result, the researchers recommended that lower doses of statins should be prescribed over higher doses, unless there is a specific LDL cholesterol target that needs to be achieved.  "A higher dose of statin is associated with increased risk of toxicity, [so] it may be prudent not to use a statin dose beyond what is required to achieve the LDL target," the researchers wrote.  These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the dosage of statins prescribed to patients in order to minimize the potential risks associated with liver damage and cancer.”Xð  Valproate, a drug commonly used to treat epilepsy, carries a significantly higher risk of fetal death and birth defects compared to other epilepsy drugs, according to a study published in Neurology, the scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study, conducted in 2006, found that over 20 percent of pregnancies exposed to valproate resulted in death or birth defects, including deformities in the skull and limbs, as well as problems in the brain, heart, and lungs. In contrast, the risks were lower for the drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine.  These findings are consistent with several recent studies, underscoring the evidence that valproate carries a higher risk of birth defects compared to other commonly used epilepsy drugs. Dr. Kimford Meador, the study's author from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, and a fellow at the American Academy of Neurology, emphasized that many doctors and pregnant women are unaware of these risks.  The study examined 333 pairs of mother and child in both the United States and the United Kingdom. As a result of the study, Dr. Meador recommends that doctors discuss the risks associated with valproate when selecting an epilepsy drug for women of child-bearing age. Additionally, patients already taking valproate should be informed about the potential risks.  While valproate remains an important treatment option for women who cannot use other epilepsy drugs, Dr. Meador advises against using valproate as the first-choice drug for women of child-bearing potential. If valproate is used, its dosage should be limited whenever possible, according to the study.

The study, which aimed to develop a new drug for the treatment of leukemia and chronic inflammation, enlisted healthy individuals who were compensated for their participation. While two participants received harmless placebos, the remaining six were administered the experimental drug, which was in its initial phase of human testing.  Tragically, all six patients experienced severe side effects, with some even coming perilously close to death. The situation took a further grim turn when David Oakley, one of the volunteers, recently tested positive for early-stage cancer. Doctors confirmed the presence of abnormal cells in his blood tests, unequivocally indicating the disease. Fortunately, due to the early detection, medical professionals assert that the cancer is treatable. Oakley, despite the daunting battle ahead, remains determined to maintain a positive outlook, stating, "I can't dwell on it because if I dwell on it I'm just going to go down in a heap."  The repercussions of the drug study extend beyond the development of cancer, as other volunteers experienced alarming side effects that posed significant health risks. One patient's neck swelled to three times its normal size, while another saw their head grow to the size of their waist. Oakley firmly believes that the drug company Paraxel should be held accountable for their alleged misconduct. However, Paraxel vehemently denies any wrongdoing and insists that their practices were compliant with legal requirements. Nevertheless, investigations conducted by British regulatory agencies have revealed procedural lapses.  This distressing incident serves as a stark reminder of the substantial risks inherent in drug trials, even when conducted under rigorous protocols. The repercussions for both the volunteers involved and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole are far-reaching, with questions arising about the adequacy of oversight and the need for stricter regulations. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen how this disconcerting episode will impact the landscape of drug testing and the pursuit of medical breakthroughs.”Xï	  Fructose Consumption Linked to Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes Risk in Adolescents, Study Finds  Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Health Sciences University have recently published a study that provides evidence of the relationship between cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk and the consumption of fructose among adolescents. The study, which was published in the Journal of Nutrition, revealed that high dietary fructose consumption leads to lower levels of cardiovascular protectors, such as HDL cholesterol and adiponectin. The researchers also found that this risk is exacerbated by excess belly fat.   In the study, which analyzed 559 adolescents aged 14 to 18, the researchers examined various cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and blood inflammatory factors. They discovered that excess fat around the midsection contributed to the identified risk factors, while those with subcutaneous fat deposits did not show the same association.   The researchers emphasized the importance of eliminating fructose, in all its forms, from the diets of both adults and children to significantly reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease. They highlighted the need to address the high consumption of fructose among children and adolescents, which puts them at an increased risk for metabolic disorders and heart disease.   Fructose, also known as simple fruit sugar, is naturally present in fruits and vegetables, where it is bound with fiber and slowly released into the bloodstream. However, many processed food and drink manufacturers use high fructose corn syrup extract, which is metabolized differently than glucose or table sugar. Dr. Norman Pollock, one of the study authors, explained that fructose is processed primarily in the liver, leading to the production of harmful byproducts.   The study's findings have significant implications for parents and caregivers. They are advised to limit or eliminate fructose from children's diets by avoiding processed foods and sugary beverages. It is also important to monitor fruit consumption and natural fruit juices, as they can contribute to excessive fructose intake. Nutritional labels should be carefully read, as fructose and high fructose corn syrup can be found in many unexpected food sources.   Nutrition experts recommend limiting natural fructose consumption to no more than 25 grams per day from an early age to minimize the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life.”XÈ  The market for bottled water has experienced a surge in recent years as more people become aware of the potential dangers lurking in municipal water supplies. However, this growth has also given rise to a controversial practice in which major food and beverage corporations inadvertently sell tap water disguised as "pure" bottled water. This deceptive labeling has become the subject of a trade dispute in Europe.  According to a report by Occupy Monsanto, the Dasani water brand, owned by beverage giant Coca-Cola, is one such example of this counterfeit bottled water. Despite its fancy packaging, Dasani actually contains purified tap water. Many consumers mistakenly believe that bottled water is superior to tap water, which has led to Dasani being sold at a premium price. Although Dasani does remove most impurities and add minerals back in, it is important to note that the water it contains is not sourced from a natural spring, as many people assume.  A closer examination of water bottle labels reveals information about the water's source. However, this information often goes overlooked by consumers who believe they are purchasing a superior product. Independent beverage research company Canadean reports that at least two out of every five bottles of water sold globally, including Dasani, are "purified" waters rather than "source" waters derived from a spring. Supermarket own-label bottled waters, in particular, consist of treated tap water that undergoes similar treatments to source waters to meet public health requirements.  The significance of this distinction lies in the fact that water sourced from natural springs is generally considered superior to tap water. This is the foundation on which the bottled water industry was built. However, brands like Dasani, Aquafina (owned by PepsiCo), and Sparkletts have captured a significant market share by engaging in what some view as deceptive advertising.  In response to concerns over deceptive labeling, PepsiCo Inc. announced in 2007 that it would start including the words "Public Water Source" on its Aquafina labels to ensure transparency for customers. This move came after nationwide campaigns were launched to combat misleading practices in bottled water labeling.”XE  Early exposure to the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), commonly found in soup and other food can liners, as well as some plastics, has been linked to an increased risk of asthma in children, according to researchers at the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health at the Mailman School of Public Health. The findings, set to be published in the March edition of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, suggest that previously unknown environmental exposures may be contributing to the rising prevalence of asthma.  Lead author Kathleen Donohue, MD, an investigator at the Center for Children's Environmental Health and assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, stated, "Asthma prevalence has increased dramatically over the past 30 years, which suggests that some as-yet-undiscovered environmental exposures may be implicated. Our study indicates that one such exposure may be BPA."  The study measured BPA exposure by analyzing urine samples from expectant mothers during their third trimester, as well as from their children at ages three, five, and seven. Researchers looked at a BPA metabolite found in urine as an indicator of exposure. The results indicated that increased exposure to BPA during early childhood was associated with a higher risk of asthma and wheezing.  To reduce exposure to BPA, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) recommends avoiding plastic numbers three and seven, and many also include number six in the list of plastics to avoid. The NIEHS also suggests choosing glass, porcelain, or stainless steel containers over plastic, particularly when storing food in the freezer or when using them for hot foods or liquids.  An ABC News report from 2011 highlighted that "93 percent of Americans have BPA in their bodies," according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report suggested consuming fresh produce instead of frozen produce in plastic bags and opting to eat at home more often to avoid potential exposure from restaurant food preparation and defrosting practices.”X
  Toxic Substances in Food: Understanding Oxalates and Their Effects  In a world where contaminants have tainted the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we consume, the mere suggestion that our clean and nourishing meals may contain hidden "poisons" is disconcerting, to say the least. Yet, these substances do exist in the plant kingdom, serving a crucial purpose for the health of the plants themselves. The problem arises when our own physiology is compromised, rendering us unable to neutralize these toxins, leading to a myriad of health issues. So, what exactly are these poisons, where do they hide, who should be cautious, and how can we minimize their impact?  One such toxin is oxalate, a plant poison that naturally occurs in the roots, leaves, and stems of certain highly nutritious vegetables. Oxalates resemble minuscule shards of glass, armed with pointed edges that deter insects from feasting on the plants. Generally, these substances pose no harm to humans, as our intestinal microbiota consume them and efficiently eliminate them through our stools. Unfortunately, factors such as antibiotic use, chronic stress, and diets rich in sugar and fat can decimate the delicate bacteria responsible for processing oxalates, leaving our intestinal system ill-equipped to handle them safely and effectively.  Foods abundant in oxalates include:  - Spinach: This leafy green, often celebrated for its nutritional value, is also a significant source of oxalates. Consumption should be moderated for those with compromised intestinal health. - Beets: Known for their vibrant color and earthy taste, beets also contain high levels of oxalates. Individuals with conditions such as kidney stones may want to limit their intake. - Swiss chard: With its colorful stems and large, tender leaves, Swiss chard is a popular choice among health-conscious individuals. However, its oxalate content should be taken into account by those susceptible to oxalate-related health issues. - Rhubarb: Often used in desserts and jams, rhubarb possesses a tart flavor, but it also carries a significant load of oxalates. Consumption should be moderated, especially for individuals with kidney issues.  It is crucial to note that while oxalates can pose challenges for some individuals, they should not be demonized. For most people, a well-balanced diet that includes oxalate-rich foods is safe and healthy. However, those with compromised intestinal health or preexisting conditions should exercise caution and consult with healthcare professionals to determine the best approach”X   In a blog post from November 2010 on the National Vaccine Information Center's MedAlerts, computer scientist Steven M. Rubin, Ph.D., discusses the incidents of abortion and stillbirth events associated with the HPV4 vaccine Gardasil. Dr. Rubin, who manages the online searchable VAERS database voluntarily and independently, explains that he wanted to investigate claims that the H1N1 Flu vaccine causes miscarriages using VAERS data.  Dr. Rubin describes how VAERS uses the MedDRA symptom classification to determine whether an event resulted in a miscarriage. He states that the second-level term "Abortions and stillbirth" is a valid way to identify miscarriages. He also notes that vaccines that have been administered for a longer period of time would likely have more reported symptoms.  Contrary to his initial expectations, Dr. Rubin finds that the H1N1 Flu vaccine appears in miscarriage events more often than almost any other vaccine. However, the vaccine that appears most frequently in the VAERS records associated with miscarriage is Gardasil, with 297 mentions. This is surprising considering that Gardasil has only been available for four years.  Dr. Rubin advises pregnant women to read the product manufacturers' insert for the vaccine they are considering and consult with healthcare professionals before making a decision about vaccination during pregnancy. He also cites a recently released study titled "New Adjuvanted Vaccines in Pregnancy: What is Known About Their Safety?" which highlights the limited knowledge on the side effects of adjuvants during pregnancy.  Overall, Dr. Rubin's findings and the lack of research on vaccine safety during pregnancy raise concerns and emphasize the need for further investigation and careful consideration when it comes to vaccinating pregnant women.”X²
  Enzymes: Crucial Catalysts for a Healthy Body  Enzymes, the molecules that serve as catalysts for all chemical reactions in the body, are essential for sustaining life. They can be divided into two basic categories: digestive enzymes, which break down food particles in the stomach before their nutrients can be absorbed, and metabolic enzymes, which work in the bloodstream to digest foreign debris and perform other functions in bodily tissues. A chronic deficiency of enzymes can weaken the immune system, contribute to illness, and even promote diseases like cancer.  While the body produces both types of enzymes, they can also be found in raw foods and can be obtained through oral supplementation. To achieve and maintain optimal health, it is crucial to have an adequate supply of both forms. The body produces twenty-two different types of enzymes, primarily from the pancreas, but this production diminishes as we age.  The three main digestive enzymes are amylase, lipase, and protease, which break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, respectively. Other enzymes, such as cellulose and lactose, break down fiber and dairy. These enzymes work in the stomach during the pre-digestion process. However, when food is cooked or processed, its naturally occurring enzymes are destroyed. Consuming denatured food puts a burden on the body as it depletes its diminishing enzyme supply in an attempt to complete the pre-digestion process. Insufficient pre-digestion leads to an excess production of stomach acid, causing acid reflux, heartburn, gas, bloating, and malnutrition, even in overweight individuals, due to incomplete digestion. Partially digested proteins in the intestines can create toxic substances that enter the bloodstream and weaken the immune system, contributing to various serious health conditions.  To counter the negative effects of enzyme deficiency, it is recommended to consume raw food, reduce the consumption of cooked and processed foods, chew food thoroughly to activate enzymes in saliva, and regularly supplement meals with digestive enzymes. Enzyme-rich foods ensure complete digestion and leave the body's enzyme supply available for other processes.  Complementing the work of digestive enzymes are metabolic enzymes, which facilitate almost every chemical reaction and cellular function in the body. These enzymes cleanse the blood, reduce inflammation, and perform other vital bodily processes. When metabolic enzymes are diverted for digestion requirements, a deficiency can occur. A weakened immune system resulting from an enzyme deficiency allows for the accumulation of disease-causing agents and cancer-causing substances, hindering the body's ability to suppress or contain the growth of”XR
  MarketWatch recently revealed some eye-opening information about the soda pop industry in an article titled "10 things the soda business won't tell you." Unfortunately, most of the news is not favorable for soda drinkers. For many, soda is an acquired taste, much like beer. It takes time for people to get used to the flavor because, surprisingly, our bodies initially reject it. Parents have even witnessed their children complaining of pain while drinking soda, but reassuringly tell them, "don't worry, you'll get used to it." However, there is a glimmer of hope in the MarketWatch report. Studies show that more people are choosing to consume water over soda. While perhaps less exciting, many are opting for water from plastic bottles owned by major soda companies such as Coca-Cola (Dasani), PepsiCo (Aquafina), and Dr Pepper Snapple (Deja Blue).  Now, let's delve into the not-so-good news about soda:  1) Increased consumption of sugary beverages like soda has been a major contributor to the obesity epidemic and a rise in diabetes cases. A 2012 report published by the Institute of Medicine highlighted the connection between rising soda consumption and obesity.  2) Just because a beverage claims to be "diet," studies suggest that it may not be as healthy as people believe. Recent research by French scientists, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found a strong correlation between diet drinks and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.  3) Energy drinks, and consequently caffeine intake, are on the rise. The FDA sets limits on the amount of caffeine allowed in soft drinks, but no such restrictions exist for energy drinks. Major soda companies have their own lines of energy drinks. It is also worth noting that mixing high amounts of caffeine with alcohol can create a dangerous concoction that has led many individuals to end up in the emergency room after a night of drinking. Tom Sugarman, an emergency physician and spokesperson for the American College of Emergency Physicians, warns, "We're seeing more and more people coming in with these issues, especially young people who are mixing their energy drinks with alcohol."  4) A study conducted by the Center for Science in the Public Interest revealed that doctors and dentists are receiving money from soda companies. Additionally, the Food Research and Action Center and Feeding America have received donations from beverage companies. These two organizations are opposed to restrictions on the SNAP program (formerly known as food stamps) that aim to prevent the use of these benefits to purchase soda.  So, what should we be drinking instead?”X¿
  Federal Agency Cancels Oil and Gas Lease, Preserving Sacred Land in Montana  In a rare triumph for the people against an overreaching federal agency, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was recently compelled to revoke an oil and gas lease in the Badger-Two Medicine region of northwestern Montana. This decision ensures the preservation of land that holds deep cultural and traditional significance to members of the Blackfoot Nation.  John Murray, the Blackfeet Nation's Historic Preservation Officer, hailed the cancellation as a historic day for his tribe. The Interior Secretary, Sally Jewell, concurred, stating that the action was in the best interest of the tribe and its future generations. Jewell further emphasized the importance of safeguarding the rich cultural and natural resources of the Badger-Two Medicine region from the irreparable harm that would result from oil and gas development.  According to Indian Country Today, the 130,000-acre Badger-Two Medicine region resides within the Lewis and Clark National Forest, nestled between Glacier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness, and the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. This area holds immense historical, cultural, and spiritual significance for the Blackfeet Tribe, and is recognized as a Traditional Cultural District. In recognition of its importance, Congress withdrew the region from mineral development in 2006.  The BLM had initially granted a 6,200-acre oil and gas lease to Solenex, a Louisiana-based company, under the tenure of former Interior Secretary James Watt in 1982. However, operations remained in limbo since 1985. The BLM ultimately determined that the lease had been improperly issued, as it violated the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historical Preservation Act.  Secretary Jewell's decision followed a thorough examination of the records and consultations with the U.S. Forest Service, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the Blackfeet tribe, the lease-holding company, and other concerned parties. Numerous ethnographic and archaeological studies have been conducted on the land, further justifying the cancellation of the lease.  This BLM decision effectively concludes the legal battles initiated by the Mountain States Legal Foundation, which had been representing Solenex in challenging the Interior Department's initial decision to cancel the lease. All of the originally issued leases in the region, which were granted over three decades ago, have faced extensive administrative, legal, and legislative scrutiny due to the unique significance of the Badger-Two Medicine region and concerns surrounding the processes leading to the lease issuance.  Indian Country Today reported that approximately two-thirds of the”XS
  New research unveiled today at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology's Annual Meeting suggests that older Americans can enhance their memory through lifestyle adjustments such as memory exercises, physical fitness, healthy eating, and stress reduction. This study, conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and funded by the Fran and Ray Stark Foundation Fund for Alzheimer's Disease Research, the Judith Olenick Elgart Fund for Research on Brain Aging, and the Parlow-Solomon Professorship on Aging, sheds light on the crucial role of mental health in healthy aging.  Lead investigator Gary Small, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, explains, "We've known for years that diet and exercise can help people maintain their physical health, which is a key component of healthy aging. But maintaining mental health is just as important. Now we have evidence which suggests that people can preserve their memory by adding memory exercises and stress reduction to this routine."  This groundbreaking study is the first to examine the effects of combining memory exercises and stress reduction with a healthy diet and exercise on memory improvement. Over a span of 14 days, the researchers randomly assigned individuals with normal baseline memory performance scores to two groups, with a sample size of 17 participants. The test group followed a memory improvement plan that included various memory exercises and stress reduction techniques, while the control group made no behavior modifications.  The memory improvement plan involved performing memory training brainteasers, crossword puzzles, and memory exercises throughout the day to stimulate the brain. Additionally, participants adhered to a healthy diet consisting of five meals daily, featuring a balanced mix of omega-3 fats, low-glycemic index carbohydrates (like whole grains), and antioxidants. This dietary approach aimed to prevent fluctuations in blood glucose levels, as glucose serves as the primary energy source for the brain. Furthermore, the plan incorporated physical fitness through brisk daily walks and stretching exercises, known to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's Disease. Lastly, stress reduction techniques such as stretching and relaxation exercises were employed to manage stress levels, as stress can release cortisol, impairing memory and shrinking memory centers in the brain.  Before and after the 14-day study, researchers conducted positron emission tomography (PET) scans to measure brain activity in each participant. The results revealed that individuals following the memory improvement plan experienced a 5% decrease in brain metabolism in the dorsal lateral prefrontal region, which is closely associated with working memory and other cognitive functions. This suggests that these participants were utilizing their”X0	  Title: U.S. Intelligence Officials Concerned Over Missing Commercial Airliners Potentially Used for Terrorist Attacks  In an article published on March 24, I discussed the possibility of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 being involved in a government cover-up, suggesting that the aircraft might have been delivered to a rogue nation for transformation into a weapon. Today, U.S. intelligence officials have echoed my concerns, warning that 11 commercial airliners that have gone missing in Tripoli could be weaponized for terrorist attacks on U.S. cities.  According to Bill Gertz of the Free Beacon, Western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that these jets could be used for terrorism across North Africa. Furthermore, the reports even mentioned the potential for an attack on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. This warning bears a striking resemblance to my story from five months ago, mirroring the exact sequence and names of the cities involved.  Initially, my story was met with criticism for its perceived wild conspiracy theories. However, as selfnews readers have come to realize, many of the topics I cover here tend to be ahead of their time, proving to be credible and even prophetic. This recent warning from U.S. intelligence officials reaffirms the validity of my concerns.  The missing commercial airliners from Tripoli are a cause for serious counterterrorism concern, particularly due to the proximity of the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. The potential for these aircraft to be outfitted with weapons and launched against major U.S. cities is a pressing issue that needs immediate attention and precautionary measures.  Though I cannot disclose specific details for security reasons, as a qualified aircraft pilot and a high-IQ laboratory director, I can identify at least five airborne threat tactics that the U.S. should be prepared to defend against.  As the situation unfolds, it is crucial that the necessary steps are taken to ensure the safety of U.S. cities and prevent any potential terrorist attacks. The concerns raised by U.S. intelligence officials highlight the urgency of this matter, reinforcing the importance of vigilance and preparedness.”X¢
  Unsweetened, raw cocoa powder, the key ingredient behind the luscious taste of chocolate, offers a plethora of health benefits that often go unnoticed due to its incorporation into overly sweetened confections like candy bars. However, this raw powder, surprisingly low in calories and high in fiber, boasts a variety of potent antioxidants. When combined with heated skim organic milk and a hint of stevia sweetener, it becomes a delectable, low-fat treat packed with antioxidants.  One of the primary reasons cocoa is considered a healthful food is due to its high flavonoid content. Flavonoids, derived from plants, are compounds that neutralize harmful free radicals. These radicals are responsible for cell death and mutation, making flavonoids a powerful weapon against cancer. Most plants contain varying concentrations of flavonoids, as these compounds aid in wound healing and repelling invasive pests. Consequently, they play a similar role in the human body's defense mechanisms. Cocoa, ounce for ounce, is rich in these valuable compounds, making it an incredibly healthy food choice. Additionally, cocoa flavonoids are believed to inhibit the oxidation of detrimental cholesterol, potentially reducing the risk of artery plaque build-up and promoting more efficient circulation. Regular consumption of cocoa powder may help prevent coronary disease, stroke, and various types of cancer.  Cocoa is also abundant in theobromine, a member of the alkaloid family of phytochemicals. This chemical, responsible for the toxicity of chocolate to animals such as cats and dogs, holds therapeutic value for humans. Theobromine aids in lowering blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels and facilitating unobstructed blood flow. Its stimulant effects are similar to caffeine, but unlike caffeine, it does not stimulate the central nervous system. Consequently, cocoa's theobromine content not only contributes to circulation improvement but also offers potential health benefits.  Furthermore, cocoa's high antioxidant content may not only benefit internal organs but also serve as an effective anti-aging tool for the skin. A study discovered that individuals who consumed dark chocolate with a 70 percent cocoa content daily for several weeks developed a higher tolerance to UV exposure. After exposure to UV lamps, these participants exhibited less skin reddening and appeared to have less cellular damage compared to those who did not consume chocolate or consumed varieties with lower cocoa levels. The conclusion drawn from this study suggests that a cocoa-rich diet enhances the skin's ability to protect itself against UV damage.  Lastly, cocoa contains phenylethylamine, a chemical also found in the human brain.”X+
  Global Dairy Forum Created to Counter Anti-Dairy Movement  In response to the growing anti-dairy movement that has criticized the health effects of milk products, the dairy industry has formed the Global Dairy Forum. Comprised of major dairy firms including Arla Foods, Campina, Fonterra, and Dairy Farmers of America, the forum aims to coordinate dairy research and improve the image of milk products. Leading the forum is Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, which has pledged to support a campaign to educate British consumers about the health benefits of drinking milk.  The need for such a forum became apparent at the recent International Dairy Federation summit, where it was noted that milk sales have been declining due to anti-dairy campaigns linking the beverage to various diseases and disorders. To counter this negative perception, the Global Dairy Forum plans to launch campaigns targeting schools to increase the consumption of milk and dairy products among students. Additionally, the forum aims to encourage women to drink more milk to boost their calcium intake.  According to Alain Guilpain, senior dairy buyer at Tesco, there is a lack of awareness among consumers regarding the fat content of milk. More than 90 percent of consumers are unaware of this information, and a recent study by the Milk Development Council found that half of the participants overestimated the fat content by more than six times. Guilpain believes that by providing accurate information, the forum can dispel misconceptions and educate consumers about the unique health properties of milk.  Critics of the dairy industry, however, argue that the Global Dairy Forum will only serve to spread misleading information about milk and potentially exacerbate health problems for consumers. Consumer advocate Mike Adams points out that milk consumption has been linked to constipation, sinusitis, digestive disorders, and heart disease. Adams believes that the dairy industry is attempting to convince adults that a beverage meant for baby cows should be a regular part of their diet. He claims that this requires extensive marketing and propaganda.  The dairy industry, on the other hand, emphasizes that milk is an important source of dietary calcium, which is crucial for preventing brittle bones. A survey conducted last year revealed that a significant percentage of British children aged 11 to 18 consumed less than their recommended daily intake of calcium.  In an effort to combat the negative perception of milk, the Global Dairy Forum aims to provide accurate information and promote the health benefits of consuming milk and dairy products. However, critics argue that this could potentially lead to further misinformation and health issues. The debate surrounding the dairy industry's campaign continues as the forum launches its initiatives to boost”XÙ
  In recent years, American cities have begun to resemble war zones, as the number of people killed by gunfire continues to rise. Memorial Day weekend served as a stark reminder of this disturbing trend, as Baltimore experienced its deadliest month in 15 years, with nine people killed and many more injured. Similarly, Chicago witnessed 12 deaths and 43 injuries from shootings, including the tragic death of a four-year-old girl. Even in New York City, where crime rates had significantly dropped under previous administrations, residents of Manhattan are now 45 percent more likely to be killed during the current administration of Mayor Bill DeBlasio.  The New York Post reported on May 26 that the number of killings in the borough has increased by about 45 percent compared to the same period last year. Shootings have also surged, with 50 incidents recorded since January 1, a 38 percent increase from last year. The number of shooting victims nearly doubled, from 33 to 61.  What factors contribute to these alarming statistics? Some may question whether there are enough police officers patrolling the streets or if a culture of violence exists among inner-city youth. Others may attribute the rise in violence to liberal public policies that hinder self-reliance and discourage two-parent families. While these factors may hold some truth, one crucial point must be made: the cities experiencing the most violence are those with stringent gun control laws that effectively prevent residents from adequately defending themselves.  Critics may argue that introducing more firearms into cities already plagued by gun violence is a reckless idea. However, this perspective fails to acknowledge the reality that gun control laws are clearly ineffective, as efforts to keep guns out of the hands of those who are not legally permitted to possess them have proven fruitless. As a result, law-abiding citizens are left vulnerable for no good reason.  Cities labeled as murder capitals do not earn that reputation by chance. Rather, they are the product of a combination of factors, including public policies, political ideologies, and socioeconomic conditions. The cases of Baltimore, Chicago, and New York City perfectly exemplify this point. Baltimore's surge in violence followed an incident in which local police officers were publicly condemned for their alleged involvement in the death of Freddie Gray, a crime suspect.  It is time to break the cycle of repeating the same ineffective strategies. The evidence is clear: strict gun control laws are not working, and law-abiding citizens are paying the price. To truly address the issue of violence in American cities, a comprehensive examination of public policy, political ideology, and socioeconomic factors is required”X™  Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, the couple who carried out the deadly attack at a holiday party in San Bernardino, had planned to cause further chaos by targeting crowded Southern California freeways, according to officials investigating the case. Farook, along with his childhood friend Enrique Marquez, had allegedly been plotting a large-scale terrorist attack on the congested 91 Freeway in California. The two had meticulously planned to use guns, pipe bombs, and other weapons to harm innocent Americans. Officials claim that Farook and Marquez had studied the 91 Freeway extensively, identifying areas of congestion where they believed they could cause the most damage. In 2011, the duo had amassed a collection of weapons and explosives for the attack, which they ultimately abandoned in 2012. A criminal complaint filed in federal court accuses Marquez and Farook of identifying areas of the 91 Freeway without exits, where they intended to stand on nearby hills and throw pipe bombs into oncoming traffic. This would have caused an immediate disruption, allowing them to shoot at motorists. Marquez is also facing accusations of plotting another terrorist attack at Riverside City College, which is close to the site of the San Bernardino attacks. The alleged plot has drawn comparisons to war tactics used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The timing of the attack, during the holiday season, has raised suspicions about the government's motives. Some believe that the government is using the fear generated by these attacks to justify increased military involvement in Syria and to gain greater control over the American public. The revelation that the attackers had also planned to target a beloved American activity, driving, has only intensified these fears. It is well-known that fear can lead people to sacrifice their freedoms in exchange for a sense of security. Terrorists often seek to target both symbolic events and everyday routines, where civilians are most vulnerable. While transportation targets are not uncommon for terrorists, they typically involve mass transit, aircraft, or bridges, according to Brian Levin, a professor at California State University in San Bernardino.”X¨
  In a world where traditional offices consist of cramped cubicles with artificial lighting, the concept of a workplace that promotes fitness and weight loss seems like a distant dream. However, some companies are challenging this norm and creating environments that encourage physical movement and exercise. Sprint, for example, has developed a new campus in Overland Park, Kansas, that aims to help its employees shed pounds. By encouraging individuals to walk from the parking lot to their buildings and incorporating frequent strolls throughout the 200-acre campus, Sprint is part of a larger trend where employers recognize the benefits of prioritizing their employees' health.  This movement is gaining momentum and is expected to yield positive outcomes not only for employee well-being and productivity but also for employers themselves. The link between physical and mental health cannot be ignored, particularly in a work setting. Individuals with physical health issues often experience a decline in mental performance. While some may argue against this notion, a wealth of evidence highlights the inseparable connection between the body and mind when it comes to overall health. Consuming nutritious foods, engaging in physical exercise, and avoiding certain ingredients have been shown to enhance brain function. Therefore, when employers actively promote healthier habits among their workforce, they can expect a boost in productivity and more capable employees. The ultimate reward, however, is for the employees themselves, as improved health leads to increased self-esteem and job satisfaction.  Unfortunately, many workplaces across the United States and the world contribute to the deterioration of human health. Recirculated air, artificial fluorescent lighting, and flawed layouts stifle creativity and suppress employee performance. As the CEO of Arial Software, I have made it a priority to provide my employees with full-spectrum lighting and ample natural light in our office suite. Regrettably, most companies prioritize cost-cutting over providing healthy options and natural light for their employees. The use of natural light, however, can have a profound impact on employee productivity and attendance. By incorporating natural sunlight, companies can help prevent clinical depression, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and prostate cancer among their workforce. Natural sunlight is a powerful healer and should be considered an essential nutrient for human health.  In a world where physical and mental health are increasingly recognized as intertwined, forward-thinking companies like Sprint are leading the way in creating work environments that prioritize employee well-being. By promoting fitness and incorporating natural light, these companies are not only investing in the health and productivity of their workforce but also reaping the benefits of a more engaged and capable team. It is my belief that this trend will continue to gain momentum, as more”Xƒ  In a surprising revelation, a former supervisor at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), known only as "Rob," has come forward in an interview with the Alex Jones Show, claiming that the agency has been deliberately hiring individuals with criminal records and psychopathic behavior. This shocking information raises concerns about the safety and professionalism of TSA staff.  Rob's job at the TSA involved filing reports on screeners who failed to follow agency procedures. He expressed alarm at the agency's decision to hire individuals with violent tendencies and a history of criminal behavior, referring to them as "psychopaths." He revealed that the agency had a program in Rhode Island that recruited prisoners with non-violent drug offenses, essentially sociopaths, and trained them to be TSA screeners.  According to Rob, individuals who presented themselves professionally were often overlooked in favor of those with a criminal background. He also claimed that the agency encouraged the hiring of veterans from the Iraq war who had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.  Furthermore, Rob stated that the TSA instructed screeners to act arrogantly and intimidate the public, as part of a larger effort to condition people for a "police state." These revelations about the TSA's behavior and hiring practices are beginning to gain attention.  U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee recently released a report highlighting the criminal behavior of TSA agents, which she attributed to the agency's hiring practices and inadequate background checks. Blackburn expressed concern over cases where TSA agents, some of whom were pedophiles and child pornographers, not only conducted pat-downs but also stole valuables from travelers' bags. She called for accountability from TSA Administrator John Pistole.  These troubling revelations raise questions about the TSA's recruitment policy and its ability to fulfill its mission as an "intelligent risk-based organization." With increasing awareness of these issues, it is hoped that necessary steps will be taken to address the problem and ensure the safety of air travel for all Americans.”X]	  Widespread consumer demand for plastic products that are free of the hormone-disrupting chemical bisphenol-A (BPA) has led to some significant positive changes in the way that food, beverage and water containers are manufactured. But a new study out of Germany has found that thousands of other potentially harmful chemicals are still leeching from plastic products into food and beverages, including an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) known as di(2-ethylhexyl) fumarate, or DEHF, that is completely unregulated.  The study, conducted by Martin Wagner and his colleague, Jorg Oehlmann, from the Goethe University Frankfurt, in conjunction with a team of researchers from the German Federal Institute of Hydrology, tested 18 different bottled water products to look for the presence of EDCs. Using advanced bioassay work and high-resolution mass spectrometry, the team identified approximately 24,520 different chemicals present in the water samples. Of major concern was DEHF, a plasticizer chemical used to make plastic bottles more flexible, which was identified as the most consistent and obvious culprit causing anti-estrogenic activity.   According to the study's published abstract, 13 of the 18 bottled water products tested showed "significant" anti-estrogenic activity, and 16 of the 18 samples inhibited the body's androgen receptors by 90 percent. The other 24,520 chemical traces besides DEHF were also found to exhibit antagonistic activity, indicating their detrimental effects on the body's hormonal system.   While DEHF was found to be anti-estrogenic, the team was unable to identify it as specifically anti-androgenic. This suggests that there may be other chemicals or chemical combinations leaching into bottled water that interfere with the body's chemical signaling system responsible for hormone production and use. The researchers concluded that additional, yet unidentified EDCs contribute to the antagonistic effect observed in bottled water.  These findings regarding DEHF are significant, but further research is needed to determine the types and extent of chemicals leaching from plastic into our food and water. Unfortunately, government agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are unlikely to conduct this research. Therefore, independent scientific studies will have to take up the charge.”•K     Xº
  Conventional medical doctors worldwide, with support from pharmaceutical companies, advocate for the universal vaccination of children against a wide range of diseases, including measles, mumps, HPV, chickenpox, and many others. This effort to eradicate diseases globally through vaccination is backed by influential figures like Bill Gates. While this goal appears noble, a closer examination reveals an underlying assumption that may not hold up to scrutiny. The assumption is that intervening in the immune system through vaccines produces better long-term results than allowing the body to naturally conquer infections. At first glance, it may seem obvious that avoiding infections is preferable, and most doctors subscribe to this belief without much consideration. They consider immune system intervention to be unequivocally superior to immune system adaptation and dismiss anyone who challenges this view. However, from a scientific perspective, is this assumption truly valid? Do mass vaccinations for non-fatal diseases genuinely enhance the health and well-being of recipients?   Critically evaluating vaccines It may seem unusual to apply the principles of scientific reasoning to the subject of vaccinations. After all, vaccines are typically accepted unquestioningly by both medical professionals and the public, right? Questioning vaccines is often equated to challenging established scientific concepts, such as Darwinism, in the minds of many. Yet, this reveals a fundamental flaw in the pro-vaccine camp: their fear of being questioned. They are so apprehensive about scientific scrutiny that they reframe the debate as one between "doctors vs. quacks," avoiding a discussion based on scientific evidence (which they lack) versus quackery (which they claim opponents possess). This defensive strategy is characteristic of intellectual desperation. If vaccines undeniably improve children's health, doctors should welcome inquiries and open debates about the merits of vaccination programs. However, the current climate surrounding vaccines is one of unwavering devotion, which rejects scrutiny and solid scientific inquiry. Vaccines are considered good simply because they are deemed so, not because of any concrete scientific evidence. This raises doubts about the application of the scientific method in the field of medicine.  The potential benefits of mild infections Meanwhile, emerging research suggests that exposing the human body to full-strength pathogens and infections that trigger an adaptive response actually leads to improved health. For instance, researchers at Nottingham University in the United Kingdom are investigating whether deliberately infecting patients with microscopic parasites like hookworms can enhance their body's ability to combat conditions like multiple sclerosis. This line of research challenges the prevailing notion that vaccinations are the sole means of bolstering immune responses.  In conclusion, the widespread push for vaccinations rests”X<
  Residents in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, have raised concerns about a state program that involves spreading sewage sludge on public lands near their homes. The program, aimed at enriching the soil and promoting vegetation growth on a former strip mine turned state game reserve, has faced backlash from locals due to potential health risks. A waste management company from New York has obtained a permit to dispose of biosolids, or treated sewage sludge, on 50 acres of Pennsylvania state land without any disposal fees. Brian Gould, a resident who recently built a house near the game lands, expressed worry about the health effects of spreading treated sewage in close proximity to their homes. Gould highlighted the issue of strong winds carrying the odor and fog caused by the spreading process throughout the valley. He described the smell as "if you took 40 Porta-Johns and kicked them over in July." Gould's wife, Allison, shared her experience of being hospitalized with bronchial spasms, which were potentially triggered by airborne pollutants from the sludge. The concern among residents was evident during a recent town meeting where approximately 100 people confronted officials from the Pennsylvania Game Commission, the entity responsible for the program. Bell Township Supervisor Dave Kauffman demanded the permits to be revoked, emphasizing that the community does not support the program. Despite reassurances from the state Department of Environmental Protection that the biosolids site has been thoroughly inspected without any violations, residents reported suffering from chronic headaches and nausea. Ryan Smith, a 32-year-old resident, commented on the unpleasant odor, comparing it to the smell of dead animals and expressing concerns about its impact on their health. Many residents, including the Goulds, are taking proactive measures by testing their water to establish a baseline for future contamination. Mahaffey Fire Chief Dan Wright declared at the meeting that he would refuse to send firefighters to any fires in close proximity to the sludge, citing uncertainties about its safety. While the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permits the application of treated sewage sludge as fertilizer, environmental groups like the Sierra Club caution against potential pollutants and disease-causing contaminants that can harm humans, animals, and the environment. The concern is that these contaminants could leach into nearby wells and groundwater. Tom Richard, director of Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment, stated that "biosolids is a euphemism for sewage sludge."”Xk
  Sleep Deprivation Declared a Public Health Crisis by CDC  New studies have shown that lack of sleep is not only linked to industrial disasters, medical errors, and motor vehicle accidents but also to chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and even cancer. Recent research supports the urgent need for better sleep habits, as shocking statistics reveal the increasing prevalence of unhealthy sleep behaviors and self-reported sleep difficulties across the country.  According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey, 35% of the nearly 75,000 adults who responded reported receiving less than seven hours of sleep per night. Additionally, 38% of respondents admitted to unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once in the preceding month, and a concerning 4.7% reported nodding off while driving. Drowsy driving alone accounts for 1550 fatalities and 40,000 traffic accident injuries annually.  The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Sleep Disorders Questionnaire reveals that adults between the ages of 40-59 are most likely to get less than eight hours of sleep, with 40.3% falling into this category. Adults between the ages of 20-39 closely follow at 37%. Moreover, those who reported receiving less than seven hours of sleep per night also experienced difficulties performing daily tasks.  The National Institutes of Health recommends a minimum of 10 hours of sleep per day for school-age children, around nine hours for teenagers, and at least seven hours for adults. Unfortunately, the National Health Interview Survey found that nearly 30% of adults get less than six hours of sleep per night on average. Only 31% of high school students receive a recommended eight hours of sleep on an average school night.  To improve sleep habits, also known as sleep hygiene, both adults and children can try going to bed at the same time each day and setting an alarm to ensure consistent wake-up times. Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before bed can also help in falling asleep and improving sleep quality. It is best to avoid eating large meals before bedtime, though a small snack is acceptable.  However, simply practicing good sleep hygiene may not be sufficient for those with active minds. Research suggests that the brain's Default Mode Network (DMN) may be the cause of the mental commotion that prevents a peaceful night's sleep. The March 2010 issue of Scientific American Magazine delves into this fascinating topic.  With the CDC declaring lack of sleep as a public health epidemic, it is crucial for individuals to prioritize their sleep habits and seek ways to quiet their busy minds”X
  In the pursuit of better health and well-being, humans have long sought methods to enhance their circulatory systems. Throughout history, various cultures have utilized vibration exercise as a means to heal ailments and improve overall quality of life. By replicating the subtle vibrations that occur with each heartbeat, this practice is believed to amplify the effects of these vibrations, leading to improved blood flow and circulation.  The key to the benefits of vibration exercise lies in its ability to promote uninterrupted blood flow, allowing vital substances like oxygen to circulate freely. Additionally, this form of exercise stimulates the lymphatic system, which acts as a network of pipes that eliminate toxins from the body. Muscle contractions, such as those produced by the heart, are necessary to move fluids throughout the body. The vibrations generated by vibration exercise machines create small muscular contractions, efficiently and gently propelling fluids in a way that effectively eliminates toxins and potentially harmful build-up.  Regular lymphatic drainage is crucial for maintaining good health, as individuals who are unable to rid their bodies of toxins are more susceptible to illness and do not experience optimal well-being. While exercise is a common method to achieve lymphatic drainage, not everyone has the capacity or opportunity to engage in extensive physical activity. Therefore, whole body vibration is a valuable alternative, facilitated by machines that aid in combating the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle and eliminating accumulated toxins.  In addition to promoting lymphatic drainage, vibration exercise machines also stimulate the activity of lymph nodes, crucial components of the immune system. This dual action allows individuals to cleanse their bodies of existing toxins while also protecting against potential illnesses. Furthermore, many people find that vibration exercise aids in weight loss. While the results may not be dramatic, this form of exercise helps the lymphatic system eliminate stored fats, resulting in a healthier and leaner physique. Additionally, vibration exercise contributes to a decrease in cortisol, a hormone associated with belly fat, while increasing serotonin levels.  The benefits of vibration exercise, particularly in terms of lymphatic system health, have been recognized and enjoyed by individuals across various cultures for thousands of years. By harnessing the power of subtle vibrations, this practice offers a promising avenue for improving overall health and well-being.”X 
  In an article published on January 17, 1995, Beatrice Dexter extolled the virtues of a combination that may have gone unnoticed by many: honey and cinnamon powder. While the mainstream media has largely neglected to explore this topic, it is worth noting that cinnamon is 26 percent sulfur based and honey is 33 percent sulfur based. When combined, these two ingredients create a powerful 59 percent sulfur-based concoction, which could explain its effectiveness.  One intriguing characteristic of honey is its ability to withstand the test of time. Unlike other foods, honey does not spoil or rot. While it may crystalize if stored in a cool dark place for an extended period, it is important to recognize that this process does not involve the transformation of honey into sugar. To restore honey to its original state, simply loosen the lid and allow the jar to sit in boiled water, as this will naturally re-liquefy the honey. However, it is crucial to avoid subjecting the honey jar to boiling water or microwaves while it is still being heated, as this could kill the enzymes present in the honey.  Unfortunately, the mainstream media has failed to shed light on these remarkable properties of honey. It is widely believed that their allegiance to BigPharma, driven by profit motives, has hindered the dissemination of information regarding the efficacy of sulfur-based remedies. Yet, current scientific knowledge suggests that honey, when consumed in appropriate dosages as a "medicine," poses no harm, even to individuals with diabetes.  Now, let us delve into the healing qualities of the sulfur-based cinnamon and honey combination, a subject that has been explored by Western scientists who, incidentally, remain unaware of the sulfur's effectiveness and the sulfur-based nature of cinnamon and honey.  HEART DISEASE: For a heart-healthy breakfast, consider replacing jelly and jam with a paste made from honey and cinnamon powder spread on bread. This dietary adjustment has been shown to reduce cholesterol in the arteries and potentially prevent heart attacks. Moreover, individuals who have already experienced a heart attack may find solace in the fact that consuming this combination could prevent subsequent occurrences. By regularly incorporating this mixture into one's diet, individuals may also experience improved breathing and a strengthened heartbeat. Notably, nursing homes in America and Canada have successfully treated patients using the cinnamon and honey combination, which has been found to revitalize the flexibility of aging arteries and veins.  ARTHRITIS: For those suffering from arthritis, a regimen of drinking a cup of hot water mixed with two tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon”X*
  In a meticulously researched blog post, Washington's Blog alleges that high-ranking officials from the Bush administration, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney, may have exploited the 9/11 attacks as a false pretext to attack Iraq under Saddam Hussein's regime. The entry begins by quoting Rumsfeld, who, just hours after the devastating attacks that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans and left the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in ruins, expressed his desire to target Saddam Hussein. This statement was attributed to Rumsfeld by NBC's chief Pentagon correspondent, Jim Miklaszewski, who claimed to have obtained it from a source within the White House Situation Room.  The blog post then references a CBS News report, which revealed that Rumsfeld's aides had documented his instructions to develop a plan to strike Iraq, despite the absence of any evidence linking Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. The notes taken by these aides quoted Rumsfeld as saying, "best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit S.H. at same time. Not only UBL," referring to Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, respectively. The notes also quoted Rumsfeld as saying, "Go massive. Sweep it all up. Things related and not."  According to the blog post, in the days following the attacks, President George W. Bush was informed during a highly classified meeting that the U.S. intelligence community had no substantial evidence connecting the 9/11 attacks to Saddam or Iraq. Furthermore, there was little proof of any association between Saddam's regime and al Qaeda in general. However, the Defense Department disputed this claim, stating that Hussein's government had not cooperated with al Qaeda prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq. CBS News later reported in 2009 that a declassified Pentagon report confirmed that the Saddam government and the terrorist organization had not collaborated before the invasion. The 9/11 Commission's report in 2004 also concluded that there was no evidence linking Saddam to al Qaeda.  The New York Times, in 2005, reported that the Bush administration had relied on intelligence from an Al Qaeda operative who was later determined to be a fabricator. This operative, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, was identified as unreliable months before the administration began using his statements to support their claim that Iraq had trained Al Qaeda members in the use of weapons of mass destruction, according to declassified portions of a Defense Intelligence Agency document from February 2002.  These allegations and findings raise significant questions about”X»	  New Bill Criminalizes Americans Discussing or Engaging in Legal Activities Abroad  In a shocking development, the US House Judiciary Committee recently passed a bill that would make it a felony crime for Americans to discuss or engage in activities that are legal in other countries. The Drug Trafficking Safe Harbor Elimination Act of 2011, sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), extends the reach of the US "War on Drugs" worldwide, punishing individuals for behavior that is perfectly legal in their host countries.  Under this bill, even a casual conversation about using marijuana or other drugs in a country where such activity is legal could lead to prosecution. Bill Piper, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, a group advocating for drug law reform, highlighted the absurdity of the legislation: "If a young couple plans a wedding in Amsterdam and intends to buy marijuana as part of the celebration, they would be subject to prosecution. The purchase and consumption of marijuana while in Amsterdam would not be illegal, but planning the wedding from the US would be a federal crime."  The language of the bill is so broad that it even encompasses US doctors who work abroad with therapies that may be considered illegal in the United States. For example, US doctors involved in medical projects in Portugal, where all drugs have been decriminalized, could face severe prosecution under this law. This legislation also targets non-Americans who engage in activities that are legal in their home countries but illegal in the US, even during a layover in an American airport.  Furthermore, Americans living overseas and producing natural medicine that is prohibited in the US could also be targeted. This has already happened to herbalist Greg Caton, who faced legal consequences for his anti-cancer salves.  Harvey Silvergate, an attorney and author, voiced his outrage at the bill's implications: "Just when you think you can't get any more cynical, a bill like this comes along. There's no logical reason for an American to believe that planning a legal activity in another country would have any impact on the US. This is an act of shameless cultural and legal imperialism, and it is simply outrageous."  The passage of this bill raises serious concerns about the extent of American jurisdiction over activities taking place outside its borders. It remains to be seen whether this legislation will face opposition or further scrutiny in the coming months.”X
  Title: Expert Warns of Inevitable Flu Pandemic and Urges Preparedness  Byline: By [Author]  In a recent town hall meeting in Illinois, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, delivered a stark warning about the likelihood of an impending flu pandemic. Osterholm, a renowned expert who has appeared on prominent television shows such as "The Oprah Winfrey Show" and CNN's "Nightline," emphasized that it is not a matter of if a pandemic will occur, but rather when it will strike.  Since the H5N1 outbreaks in 2003, experts have been cautioning that if the disease becomes easily transmissible between humans, a devastating pandemic could claim millions of lives. Osterholm stressed the importance of not underestimating the severity of the situation, stating, "The worst thing we can do is not prepare and think it will not happen," while also highlighting the numerous measures that can be taken to mitigate its impact.  Drawing upon historical patterns, Osterholm pointed out that a new pandemic emerges approximately every 50 years. The most recent example was the Hong Kong flu, or H3N2, which claimed around 700,000 lives worldwide, with 40,000 deaths in the United States alone. Experts predict that the H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has already caused 141 fatalities globally but has not yet mutated into a human-to-human transmissible form, is likely to be the next devastating pandemic.  When this pandemic does occur, Osterholm warned that the consequences will be dire, estimating a death toll ranging from 2.7 million to a staggering 360 million. He emphasized that individuals will need to take care of themselves, as the sheer scale of the devastation will overwhelm state and federal emergency management plans. Osterholm urged communities to proactively prepare by establishing their own leadership networks and planning for relief efforts and healthcare provisions. He stressed the significance of early action, stating, "Nobody in Washington or even Springfield is going to be here to help you, so you need to start thinking about this now."  Osterholm encouraged communities to view any investment made in preparedness as invaluable, emphasizing that every effort made will have a lasting impact. He highlighted the importance of maintaining hope, underscoring that throughout history, every population that endured a pandemic has ultimately survived. "We just have to keep telling ourselves that," he concluded.  In conclusion, Osterholm's warning serves as a wake-up”XÚ  Canines possess a unique ability to detect cancer in the breath of individuals with the disease, according to a pilot study conducted in Austria. The study, recently published in a scientific journal, revealed that dogs had a remarkable success rate in sniffing out lung cancer in patients. Using 120 breath samples, European researchers found that the dogs were able to detect 70 percent of cancers, surpassing many modern detection methods. Peter Errhalt, head of the pulmonology department at Krems Hospital and author of the study, stated that dogs have no trouble identifying tumor patients. This investigation builds upon earlier research that suggested dogs can detect various diseases by simply being near people who have them. In 2011, a study found that dogs could detect early-stage bowel cancer, which is difficult to detect using medical technologies. The specific compounds in the cancer scent remain unknown, but researchers in Austria are hopeful that further research will uncover the mechanism behind dogs' remarkable olfactory abilities. By understanding how dogs can detect cancer and identifying the specific compounds they smell, scientists may be able to develop new tools for cancer detection. The Austrian team plans to conduct a two-year study, which will be ten times larger than the previous trial, in order to validate their findings. Ultimately, the goal is to develop an "electronic nose" that can detect cancer in a clinical setting without the need for actual dogs.”Xo
  Drinking Coffee May Offer Protection Against Melanoma, Study Finds  Melanoma, the leading cause of skin-cancer death in the United States, may be prevented by a common habit shared by millions of Americans: drinking coffee. A recent study conducted by researchers from Yale University and the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that coffee consumption could potentially offer protection against this devastating illness.   To conduct the study, the experts analyzed data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, which involved nearly 450,000 cancer-free patients. Over a span of more than 10 years, the researchers reviewed their food intake, including coffee consumption, as well as their incidence of melanoma. It was discovered that individuals who drank more coffee daily were less likely to develop melanoma during follow-up periods. For example, those who consumed four cups of coffee daily had a 20 percent lower risk of melanoma.   Coffee contains "bioactive compounds" that may reduce the risk of melanoma, which is good news considering the widespread love for coffee in America. More than half of Americans are said to enjoy an average of over three cups per day. However, it is essential to note that this does not mean people should engage in unhealthy skin behaviors because they have their favorite coffee by their side. Erikka Loftfield, a graduate student at the Yale School of Public Health, stressed the importance of reducing sun and ultraviolet light exposure as the most crucial step in reducing melanoma risk.  The study, titled "Coffee Drinking and Cutaneous Melanoma Risk in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study," was published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. It highlights that melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the United States and that modifiable risk factors, except for exposure to ultraviolet radiation, are not well understood. The study concludes that higher coffee intake was associated with a modest decrease in the risk of melanoma in this large US cohort study, suggesting the need for further investigations of coffee intake and its constituents, particularly caffeine, with melanoma.   While this study calls for additional research, other findings outside of this study support the health benefits of drinking coffee. For instance, coffee consumption has been linked to a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer, with up to a 50 percent decrease in risk for those who drank three cups daily. Drinking coffee has also been associated with a lower risk of oral cancer, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer.  According to the Mayo Clinic”Xê	  In the weeks leading up to the implementation of budgetary sequestration, President Barack Obama issued a public warning about the severe consequences that would ensue if the planned cuts were allowed to take effect. In a speech on Feb. 19 at a shipyard in Newport News, Va., he expressed concern that politics in Washington could jeopardize important work and hundreds of thousands of jobs. He referred to the impending cuts as the sequester, describing them as wrong, unfair, and potentially damaging.  Obama went on to predict a series of dire outcomes should the sequester go into effect. He warned that over 2,000 college students would lose their financial aid, federal prosecutors would have to close cases, leading to potential releases of criminals, and cutbacks in air traffic controllers and airport security could cause delays across the country. He also highlighted the possibility of furloughs for 800,000 federal defense workers and layoffs for local first responders, police, and firefighters. It is worth noting that these individuals are paid with local funds, a fact that is often overlooked.  However, after the March 1 deadline passed and the sequester became mandatory, Obama dialed back his dire warnings. In a meeting with lawmakers on March 1, he admitted that the cuts would not be as devastating as he initially claimed. He reassured the public, saying, "We will get through this. This is not going to be an apocalypse, I think as some people have said." It is important to note that he was one of the individuals who had described the sequester in apocalyptic terms.  Recent government emails, publicized by the Washington Times, suggest that the Obama administration may have contributed to making its initial claims about the sequester's impact a self-fulfilling prophecy. In an email sent by Charles Brown, an official with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service office in Raleigh, N.C., he asked if there was any flexibility in spreading the sequester cuts to lessen the impact on fish inspections. The response from the White House was a firm "no." According to the email, the administration felt obligated to follow through on its promise that the cuts would be devastating.  In conclusion, President Obama initially warned Americans about the dire consequences of the sequester, but later downplayed its impact. Government emails suggest that the administration felt obligated to follow through on its promises, even if it meant causing harm. The true effects of the sequester remain to be seen.”X[
  In a recent investigation, the question of the pressure-cooker bomb remains unanswered. The lack of visible holes in the cooker raises concerns about the presence of shrapnel, which should have been propelled outwards upon detonation. Additionally, there is no noticeable evidence of shrapnel adhering to the cooker's walls. Furthermore, a lid from one of the cookers was found on a rooftop, allegedly blown there by the bomb. However, photos reveal no holes or shrapnel on the lid. These discrepancies raise doubt about the official narrative surrounding the Marathon bombings.  Mike Adams, a writer at selfnews, has been delving into the presence of the Craft private security team at the Marathon finish line. One member of the team was reportedly equipped with a radiation detector, which raises questions about their purpose and who hired them. Surprisingly, mainstream media has largely avoided discussing this topic.  Alastair Stevenson, a college track coach present at the Marathon, heard police announcements about a drill taking place. However, Boston police have refused to acknowledge this report. The Boston Globe tweeted about a bomb squad preparing to detonate a device near the JFK Library, but no follow-up information was provided. Instead, it was revealed to be a small fire, contradicting the initial claims. These inconsistencies and lack of transparency from authorities are concerning.  Abdul Rhaman Ali Alharbi, a Saudi national, was initially declared a suspect in the bombing but was later downgraded to a "person of interest." He was reported to be severely burned but now appears to have recovered. Furthermore, his travel visa has been revoked, and he is being deported to Saudi Arabia. Curiously, this decision came following an unscheduled meeting between President Obama and the Saudi foreign minister at the White House. These developments raise suspicions about the government's handling of the case.  The cumulative evidence suggests that lying is a prerequisite for being a government official. This notion aligns with the concept of a cult mentality, as discussed on Mike Bundrant's radio show "Mental Health Exposed." The pervasiveness of cult mentality extends beyond mental health and applies to government institutions. These organizations, such as the FBI, ATF, FDA, CIA, NIH, and CDC, often start with high aspirations and noble missions. However, as time progresses, their integrity deteriorates, following a pattern of cult development.

The survey, which focused on adults between the ages of 18 and 24, revealed that the average woman walked only 12 minutes per day, while the average man walked only 8 minutes. These figures fall far short of the British Heart Foundation's recommendation of a minimum of 30 minutes of walking per day.  The study, conducted on 2,000 British adults, also found that 15 percent of adults decided to walk somewhere but gave up partway through, opting to switch to public transportation at least once a week. Parents aged 42 to 54 largely attributed their children's lack of activity to new technology, such as smartphones and social media, and claimed that they themselves had walked more when they were the same age. However, the young adults themselves had different explanations. The most common excuse given for not walking was "I don't have anyone to walk with." Women typically cited poor weather or fatigue as reasons for not walking, while men typically blamed lack of time or a busy schedule. Among adults in general, the most common excuses were weather, lack of time, lack of fitness, not feeling safe, and feeling too tired.  The findings of this study are particularly concerning given the risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle on one hand, and the fact that walking is such an easy form of exercise on the other. "Walking can usually fit easily into your daily routine and something as simple as choosing to walk even part of the way to work instead of taking the car or bus can have a huge impact on your health," said Bupa's UK Medical Director, Paula Franklin. Adding just 20 minutes of walking to one's daily routine can dramatically reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which includes heart disease and strokes.  In addition to obesity and heart disease, a sedentary lifestyle has also been linked to an increased risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and spinal problems. Doctors are now seeing these diseases in a younger demographic as people become less active. "We are finding more young people aged between 25-30 years getting diabetes as compared to the earlier trend of adults aged between 45-50 developing the illness," said physician Rejesh Naik, a member of the Indian Medical Association. Another Indian doctor, Preeti Doshi, who runs the pain clinic at Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai, also blamed a sedent”X/
  Fluoridation Battle Brews in Sonoma County  Residents of Sonoma County, known for its picturesque towns and sprawling farmland, find themselves embroiled in a fierce debate over the fluoridation of their public water supply. As petitions circulate to maintain the county's currently un-fluoridated water, proponents of fluoridation within the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) are making headway, using selective data and anecdotal evidence in an effort to demonstrate the benefits of adding artificial fluoride to the water.  But why the fight to keep Sonoma County water pure? According to Dr. Paul Connett, director of the Fluoride Alert Network, fluoride is the only chemical added to water solely for the purpose of treating people. Interestingly, Japan and 97 percent of Western European countries do not consume fluoridated water, while approximately 70 percent of public water supplies in the United States are fluoridated.  Contrary to the claims made by pro-fluoridation advocates, data from the World Health Organization reveals that tooth decay rates have significantly decreased in all Western countries, regardless of whether water fluoridation has been implemented. In fact, most Western countries do not fluoridate their water, yet their tooth decay rates have declined at the same pace as fluoridated countries like the United States.  Sonoma County now finds itself at a crossroads, with many residents opposing the addition of fluoride to their water, much like the recent rejection of water fluoridation in Wichita, KS. With a population of around 484,000 people, Sonoma County has a significant number of individuals who are against fluoride. However, protecting their rights and educating the public while challenging influential figures within the SCWA will require a concerted effort.  Proponents of water fluoridation in Sonoma County have adopted a "life is better with teeth" public relations campaign, citing the high cost of treating cavities in children as a reason to implement fluoride. This approach attempts to address the issue of tooth decay caused by sugary foods with the introduction of artificially fluoridated water. Critics argue that this strategy is fundamentally flawed and equates to committing more "crimes against wisdom" to rectify a previous mistake.  Although the scientific support for solving dental hygiene issues through water fluoridation is questionable, it is crucial that the voices of those who value nature, health, and sanity find more support. Sonoma County has thrived without fluoride for over 163 years, but if the proposal to fluoridate the”X	
  The American Heart Association (AHA), long an opponent of vitamins and nutritional supplements, has now recommended that individuals abandon these supplements in favor of cholesterol-lowering prescription drugs like statins. The basis for this change in stance is a review of previous studies that utilized synthetic forms of vitamin E, which concluded that these supplements do not provide significant protection against heart disease. This has led the AHA to cast doubt on all vitamins, resulting in headlines claiming their worthlessness for heart health. However, it is important to recognize that this perspective is unfounded and merely represents another instance of the AHAâ€™s anti-vitamin agenda, aimed at bolstering the sales of prescription drugs.  To fully understand the intent behind these studies and the AHAâ€™s motivation for issuing such harmful advice, it is crucial to consider several key factors. Firstly, it is worth noting that almost all of these studies employed a synthetic form of vitamin E that does not exist naturally. By utilizing this chemical compound and asserting its equivalence to natural vitamin E, researchers can discredit all forms of vitamin E. However, it is important to recognize that these synthetic compounds are fundamentally different from natural vitamin E on a molecular level. Had the studies used natural vitamin E, the outcomes would likely have been far more positive. In fact, it appears that many of these vitamin studies are intentionally designed to undermine the credibility of vitamins, deliberately opting for artificial, synthetic vitamin E instead of its natural counterpart.  Furthermore, the study in question focused solely on isolated antioxidants, neglecting the fact that antioxidants function synergistically. When individuals consume whole foods or organic vitamins derived from whole foods, they benefit from a broad range of antioxidants and phytonutrients that support cardiovascular health and combat heart disease. Those seeking to maintain a healthy cardiovascular system should prioritize obtaining their nutrition from whole foods and superfoods, such as chlorella, broccoli sprouts, sea vegetables, and healthy oils. However, the studies in question did not incorporate these full spectrum superfoods or whole foods. Instead, they isolated specific chemical compounds, which inevitably diminishes their effectiveness in promoting human health. It is likely that these researchers are aware of this fact and deliberately select isolated compounds to study the impact of nutritional supplements. This approach is prevalent within western medicine and reflects the belief system of researchers and doctors who maintain that the health benefits of any food, if they exist, can typically be attributed to one or two so-called 'active ingredients.'”XP
  Obesity has been identified as an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression after radiotherapy treatment, according to researchers at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. In a study published in the Aug. 1 issue of the journal Cancer, the researchers discovered that moderately and severely obese patients had a 99 percent higher risk of developing biochemical failure, which is an early marker of cancer progression, compared to non-obese patients. Additionally, obese patients had a 66 percent increased risk of tumor recurrence or metastasis. These findings align with a previous study conducted by M. D. Anderson researchers, reported last year in Clinical Cancer Research, which revealed that weight gain or obesity at the time of diagnosis can also contribute to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer after surgery.  Sara Strom, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology and the lead researcher of both studies, emphasized that a man's body mass index (BMI) plays a significant role in the outcomes of standard prostate cancer treatments. She explained that the association between obesity and poorer outcomes is not solely due to differences in treatment but rather to disparities in tumor behavior between obese and non-obese men. Strom suggests that obese prostate cancer patients should receive closer monitoring after treatment. When there is uncertainty about the need for further therapy, she recommends considering a patient's weight in the decision-making process.  This study is the first to investigate the relationship between obesity and prostate cancer progression after primary therapy with external beam radiotherapy, a commonly used treatment option. The researchers examined the medical records of 873 patients with locally confined prostate cancer who received radiotherapy at M. D. Anderson between 1988 and 2001. Among these patients, 18 percent were mildly obese and 5 percent were moderately to severely obese. The study found that obese patients tended to be diagnosed with prostate cancer at an earlier age than non-obese patients, and African-American men had the highest obesity rates. After an average follow-up period of 96 months, 295 patients experienced biochemical failure, and cancer recurred in 127 of these patients. After adjusting for clinical and treatment variables, the researchers determined that BMI significantly predicted both rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and the return of prostate cancer.  In conclusion, these findings highlight the crucial role of obesity in prostate cancer progression after radiotherapy treatment. The results suggest that obese patients should receive closer monitoring and that weight should be considered when making decisions about further therapy. With further research and attention to these factors, medical professionals can improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients.”X"
  The modern-day consumer is bombarded with and besieged by a multitude of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, yet there is a startling lack of awareness surrounding this issue. The consequences of these chemicals on the human race as a whole remain largely unknown. In an effort to combat this ignorance, expert health officials from the French government are urging the European Union to define these endocrine-disrupting chemicals and help raise awareness of the havoc they wreak on the delicate balance of the human body's homeostasis.   Endocrine disrupters pose numerous hidden risks to the human body, essentially stifling its potential to think, reproduce, and fight off illness. These chemicals throw the endocrine system out of equilibrium, disrupting vital glandular functions. Unfortunately, medical doctors are only equipped to send bewildered patients through a battery of tests, diagnose their issues, and prescribe drugs that seldom address the root cause.   One of the primary culprits behind the health problems plaguing society today is the invisible war being waged within the endocrine system - a war on the hormone glands. This silent hormone war emanates from various sources, including the pesticide industry, the plastic industry, and the mainstream perfume and body care industries, all of which unleash endocrine-disrupting chemicals into people and the environment. Regrettably, consumers seldom grasp how these chemicals disrupt their body's delicate equilibrium. This poses a significant challenge since many individuals use these endocrine-disrupting products on a daily basis, oblivious to the invisible dangers of chemical accumulation in the body and the subsequent restriction of certain hormone production.   One glaring example of endocrine disruption can be seen in the prevalence of hysterectomies. Oftentimes, these procedures are the medical system's response to women whose ovary glands struggle to maintain a balanced production of progesterone and estrogen. In men, hormone imbalances can manifest in the failure of muscles and male body characteristics to develop after puberty. Unbalanced androgen and testosterone hormone levels have the ability to completely impede the natural progression of gender development.   The European Union is currently facing mounting pressure from the French government to take action on endocrine-disrupting chemicals. French health officials assert that these chemicals pose a significant threat to public health and have highlighted the escalating financial costs burdening the healthcare sector due to the lack of action taken to limit or eradicate these harmful substances. In response, the committee has committed to implementing new measures, as outlined in a December 2013 statement. The commission aims to publish a comprehensive strategy to address endocrine disrupters”Xø	  Hillary Clintonâ€™s health came into question after a lengthy coughing fit interrupted her speech in Iowa. Approximately 150 individuals had gathered at the Jewish Federation of Greater Des Moines to hear the former secretary of state speak about Israel. As she discussed the Iran nuclear deal, the 68-year-old Clinton had to pause her speech to consume a lozenge cough drop. Jewish Federation president David Adelman had to take over the stage while Clinton continued to cough and sought a glass of water to regain control of her voice. In between coughs, she attributed the fit to her busy campaign schedule, stating, "You do talk a lot in this campaign." This was the first of four public events in her race against Sen. Bernie Sanders to secure the support of Iowa voters.   Watch the video here: [insert link]  This coughing spell is not the first for Clinton. Ever since her initial public coughing fit before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on October 22, 2015, speculation about her health has swirled. The fact that she carries cough drops in her pockets suggests that these fits are not isolated incidents.   In 2015, Clinton's presidential campaign released a health statement confirming that she has hypothyroidism and allergies. Her physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, stated that she regularly takes the thyroid hormone Armour Thyroid and the anticoagulant drug Coumadin to prevent blood clots. She also takes an antihistamine for seasonal pollen allergies and vitamin B12. Clinton does not smoke and only consumes alcohol occasionally. Armour Thyroid is commonly prescribed for patients with an underactive thyroid, thyroid enlargement, or thyroid cancer. After suffering a fall in her home in December 2012, she began taking blood thinners as a precautionary measure against blood clots and continues to take them. While her doctor maintains that she is in excellent health and fit to serve as president, her coughing episodes continue to raise concerns.  During a campaign event in Burlington, Iowa, a woman questioned Clinton about her health, referencing a FOX News statement suggesting that the Democratic presidential candidate was unfit for the White House due to illness. Clinton responded by rolling her eyes and stating, "Oh my. Well, you know, they say nearly anything about me. I've got to tell you, there are several themes they keep beating the drums on. I'll match my endurance against anybody." She received loud applause when she added, "And last spring, my doctor put out a letter and you know, said what great health."”X
  In a recent piece published by Reuters, USA Today, and other mainstream media outlets, a false narrative is being pushed, attempting to dismiss the existence of "medical conspiracy theories." According to this narrative, drug companies, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. government have never engaged in unethical experiments, lied to the public, covered up natural remedies, or colluded with the pharmaceutical industry. The notion that GMOs were created with the environment in mind is also being propagated.  By labeling these concerns as "conspiracy theories," authors of questionable scientific studies and journalists who prioritize corporate interests aim to belittle the documented history of criminal activities by Big Pharma, the medical experiments conducted on children, the government's involvement in illicit medical trials on prisoners, and the harm inflicted on the American people by the medical industrial complex. The mainstream media's coverage of these events can only be described as Orwellian, as it attempts to rewrite history and erase the instances where drug companies, the NIH, and the U.S. government were directly responsible for the deaths of prisoners, African Americans, infants, and soldiers under the guise of "scientific medicine."  I refuse to overlook the true history of medical conspiracies and the countless lives lost due to the relentless pursuit of profit at the expense of human dignity. To counter the mainstream media's deluded attempt to whitewash these real medical conspiracies, we have compiled a list of the top ten verifiable instances, accompanied by credible sources. It is crucial to educate ourselves and acknowledge the genuine history that the mainstream media is attempting to erase.  Here are the top ten TRUE medical conspiracies:  1) Pfizer's illegal medical experiments on Nigerian children - In 2009 and subsequent years, we reported on the case where Pfizer was ordered to compensate Nigerian families after conducting illicit medical experiments that resulted in the deaths and injuries of numerous children. Pfizer sought approval for its new antibiotic Trovan and took advantage of a meningitis, cholera, and measles outbreak in Kano, Nigeria. Without informing the parents of the children, Pfizer enrolled 200 of them in an unlicensed drug trial, disregarding the fact that proven medications were readily available. Eleven children died, and others suffered brain damage, organ failure, and severe side effects, all of which were not disclosed to the parents.  In conclusion, it is essential to scrutinize the mainstream media's attempts to dismiss legitimate concerns as mere "conspiracy theories." The documented history of medical crimes committed by pharmaceutical companies, the NIH, and the U.S. government cannot be ignored”XŸ  This interview is an excerpt from Kevin Gianni's Renegade Water Secrets, a book that explores the topic of water and its various uses. David Wolfe, the author of Amazing Grace and Eating for Beauty, shares his insights on bottled water and using water to make other drinks. When asked about the best bottled waters, Wolfe suggests that while they may not compare to the spectrum of options discussed in the book, they are still a viable choice when traveling or on a plane. He emphasizes the importance of choosing glass bottled water over plastic due to its recyclable nature and lack of toxic chemicals. Wolfe recommends brands such as Volvic Water, Voss Water, and Evian as his top picks. For those seeking the best glass bottled water available online, he directs them to Grander Water from Austria, which not only offers high-quality water but also magnetically treated glass to keep the water charged. Shifting the conversation to tea, Wolfe explains that it is a great way to add extra nutrients and herbal tinctures to one's diet. He shares his personal preference of creating teas using herbs from his own forest, as drinking plain water can become monotonous after a while.”Xk
  Vitamin D has long been suspected to play a role in reducing the risk of prostate cancer. Researchers from the University of Colorado Cancer Center have now conducted a study that sheds light on how exactly vitamin D acts on a gene that lowers inflammation, potentially reducing the risk of prostate cancer. The study, published in the journal Prostate, builds upon previous research that has linked vitamin D deficiency to prostate cancer risk factors such as older age, living at a northern latitude, and African descent.  The researchers also found that prostate cancers diagnosed in the summer or autumn, when vitamin D levels are highest, tend to be less deadly than those diagnosed in the winter or spring. This observation is consistent with studies showing that prostate cancer levels are low in Japan, where people consume high levels of soy and fatty fish rich in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s help stabilize vitamin D in the body, while soy helps it remain active for longer.  Recent studies have suggested that vitamin D supplementation may slow the progression of prostate cancer and that prostate cancer cells often contain receptors for vitamin D. To better understand how vitamin D affects prostate cancer cells, the researchers aimed to identify the specific genes that vitamin D turns on or off in prostate cancer.  They found that when vitamin D is applied to prostate cancer cells, it inhibits their growth. However, it has not been proven as an anti-cancer agent. The researchers focused on a gene called GDF-15, which prior research had shown to be increased by vitamin D. Surprisingly, they discovered that GDF-15 expression did not correlate with either normal or cancerous prostate tissue.  However, when the researchers considered the variable of inflammation, they discovered a significant relationship. The levels of GDF-15 were found to be lowest in prostate cells with the highest levels of inflammation. Inflammation is believed to drive many cancers, including prostate, gastric, and colon cancer. The researchers suggest that GDF-15 may help keep prostate tissue healthy by suppressing inflammation, which is a potential driver of prostate cancer.  The study also revealed that GDF-15 expression inhibits another gene called NFkB, which has been shown in previous studies to increase inflammation and contribute to tumor formation and growth. Despite efforts to dampen the activity of NFkB with drug treatments, no successful results have been achieved thus far.  This study provides valuable insights into the role of vitamin D in prostate cancer and suggests potential targets for future research and drug development.”Xö  In anticipation of the extensive military training known as Jade Helm 15, set to take place in the American Southwest, the mainstream media has come under scrutiny for its handling of concerns surrounding the exercises. While it is true that a few individuals have propagated unfounded theories online, such as the idea that closed Walmart stores are involved in a sinister plot to detain dissidents, the media has unfairly used these claims to attack all those expressing apprehension about the drills. By doing so, they have revealed themselves to be a propaganda machine.  It is not surprising that many Americans are wary of Jade Helm 15. Polls indicate that over two-thirds of the population believes the federal government is a threat to liberty and is "out of control." The remaining third appears to be less informed. Furthermore, the publicly available information about the military exercise is enough to raise concerns. Special Forces troops will roam the streets of American towns with military weaponry, dressed in civilian clothes and driving civilian vehicles, all while attempting to blend in with the local community without being detected. The labeling of certain conservative states as "hostile" in the exercise, despite claims that it is meant to simulate overseas operations, is also peculiar.  When combined with recent events, such as federal reports identifying conservatives and Christians as extremists or potential terrorists, President Obama's controversial background, and the White House's questionable track record on honesty, it is understandable that legitimate concerns have arisen across America, particularly in Texas. These concerns have been voiced by outraged citizens in town hall meetings and online, prompting Texas Governor Greg Abbott to order the Texas State Guard to monitor the exercise. Abbott emphasized the importance of protecting Texans' safety, constitutional rights, private property rights, and civil liberties during the training operation.  It is clear that the mainstream media's portrayal of the concerns surrounding Jade Helm 15 has been misleading and has only served to further divide public opinion. The article in question, by Alex Newman and republished from TheNewAmerican.com, provides a more balanced perspective on the issue.”X#
  Foods that promote the growth of Candida, a type of yeast that can cause inflammation, have been found to have inflammatory properties in other ways as well. While some foods, such as omega-6 fats, naturally possess anti-inflammatory properties that aid in the healing process, they are not inherently harmful. The negative effects of sugar on inflammation are well-known, but this extends beyond white sugar. Sugars, including fruit juices, honey, agave, brown rice syrup, and other sweeteners, feed Candida and other infectious microbes while also causing inflammation. The excessive consumption of sugar is prevalent in most diets, making it crucial to eliminate sweet foods when healing the gut, with the exception of stevia.  Refined foods, which have had their fiber and minerals removed, contribute to acidity in the body and lack beneficial fats. Therefore, it is essential to avoid refined carbohydrates like table sugar, salt, white rice, pasta, and processed starches. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and conventionally grown foods containing pesticides and herbicides also harm the gut microbiome. The toxic nature of these foods creates an inhospitable environment for beneficial flora, allowing Candida and other infectious microbes to thrive. Factory farmed animal products, raised on genetically modified grains, are particularly inflammatory due to the lack of a diverse natural diet. Corn, wheat, oats, hay, and certain grasses in these animals' diets contribute to inflammation.  Gluten, specifically a new type of gluten molecule found in wheat today due to hybridization, is more inflammatory than previous versions. Although not the sole gluten molecule in bread, it is prominent and absent from ancient wheat strains. Contrary to popular belief, fats such as coconut and avocado possess healing properties and do not naturally lead to obesity. The harmful fats are commercial, highly processed, rancid, trans, and other unnatural fats. These fats contribute to inflammation and are associated with autoimmune diseases.  Toxic ingredients like soy lecithin, casein, and protein isolates, which are high in omega-6 fats, contribute to acidity. Excitotoxins, including MSG, aspartate, and glutamates, overexcite nerves and damage the nervous system. Inflammation occurs when there is an excessive presence of free radicals, which are produced during daily bodily functions. While free radicals play essential roles in eliminating weak cells, an excess can impede healing. Additionally, specific nutrient deficiencies can lead to inflammation through various mechanisms.”X±  DEET, the popular insect repellent used by millions of Americans to ward off mosquito bites, may be losing its effectiveness. A recent study published in the journal PLoS One reveals that mosquitoes are becoming less responsive to DEET and are even learning to shut off their senses when exposed to it.  Dr. James Logan and his team from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine conducted the research, focusing on the Aedes aegypti mosquito type known for biting during the day and spreading diseases like yellow fever and dengue fever. The researchers exposed the mosquitoes to small amounts of DEET and monitored their behavior over several hours.  The study found that after three hours of exposure, many of the mosquitoes were no longer repelled by DEET as they were initially. Even minimal exposure to the chemical resulted in the mosquitoes developing immunity to it, rendering it ineffective beyond three hours.  Dr. Logan explains that the mosquitoes are habituating to the repellent, similar to how humans develop a tolerance to certain smells over time. The effects of DEET exposure last up to three hours, after which the mosquitoes are no longer affected by it. It is believed that the sensory receptors of the mosquitoes gradually shut down after exposure, preventing them from smelling or sensing DEET.  As a result, DEET-exposed mosquitoes are likely to land on human skin that has been sprayed with DEET and attempt to feed on it, as if it had never been sprayed in the first place.  These findings build upon earlier research by Dr. Logan, who hypothesized a genetic factor that could explain why some mosquitoes do not respond to DEET. In 2010, Nature reported that certain mosquito types have evolved to overcome the effects of DEET due to a dominant gene that can be passed down through mosquito families.  The discovery of a gene that causes DEET resistance in mosquitoes was described by Leslie Vosshall of Rockefeller University as the most surprising result of the earlier study.  The diminishing effectiveness of DEET raises concerns about the future of mosquito bite prevention. As mosquitoes adapt to the chemical, new strategies will be needed to combat the spread of diseases they carry.”X§
  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to as Obamacare, is once again making headlines due to its failure to address the shortage of qualified physicians to treat the newly insured and the millions more who will follow. The architects of the ACA neglected to properly consider this critical issue when formulating the law. In a recent article by the Associated Press on December 7, Olivia Papa, a 61-year-old woman who signed up for insurance through the ACA exchange, shared her struggles to find a primary care physician. Despite being relatively healthy, Papa and her husband needed to see separate specialists. However, when she contacted the doctor assigned to her, she discovered that the doctor was not on her plan. A different doctor was assigned, but the outcome was the same; her attempts to schedule an appointment went unanswered.  The shortage of physicians has long been recognized as a looming problem by various healthcare organizations, predating the implementation of Obamacare. Numerous studies have highlighted the anticipated shortages in primary care physicians, as well as in the fields of geriatrics, pediatrics, and general surgery. Rather than developing a comprehensive plan to address this issue, Obamacare merely served as a temporary solution to a much larger problem. This issue was underscored in a 2012 report by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The report clearly identified the legislative issues that Obamacare failed to address, including the training of physicians. The AAMC report emphasized that physician training is closely linked to patient care, and historically, Medicare has covered the costs of training and the advanced medical services provided by teaching hospitals. However, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established a cap on Medicare-funded Graduate Medical Education (GME) at 1996 levels for most teaching hospitals, hindering their ability to expand or establish new programs. While the ACA did not eliminate the cap, it did allow for the training of approximately 300 additional physicians per year. However, this falls far short of the 10,000 additional physicians needed annually to address the overall physician shortage.  Approximately 6.7 million individuals signed up for health insurance through the ACA exchange in 2014, and estimates project that a total of 26 to 32 million people will enroll through the exchange in the coming years. These numbers exacerbate the projected physician shortages, which pose a potential healthcare disaster, particularly for the baby boomer generation. According to the AAMC, the projected shortage of physicians through 2020 is 91,500, with 45,400 of those being primary care”X.
  In George Orwell's prophetic novel, 1984, he envisioned a future where society lived under constant surveillance by the government through advanced technology. Little did he know that his predictions would become a reality far beyond his imagination. Today, surveillance cameras are ubiquitous, and law enforcement agencies possess technology capable of penetrating walls and invading private homes. Federal intelligence agencies like the NSA routinely intercept and monitor internet and wireless communications. Now, it seems that even our household appliances can spy on us.  According to a report by Britain's Daily Mail, Samsung has issued a warning to owners of its internet-connected "smart TVs" that their conversations near the device could be overheard. These popular televisions are voice activated, allowing users to switch channels or receive suggestions by giving verbal commands. However, this technology comes with an alarming consequence - it records all other sounds in the vicinity of the television.  Samsung's privacy policy states that if personal or sensitive information is spoken near the TV, it will be captured and transmitted to a third party. This means that family arguments or confidential discussions in corporate boardrooms equipped with these smart TVs could be recorded and potentially shared. Privacy advocates are understandably upset and concerned about the abuse of this technology by government agencies and the violation of personal privacy.  Renate Samson, from the campaign group Big Brother Watch, aptly named after Orwell's dystopian state, expressed her worry about the invasion of privacy. She stated, "This thing is going to be in your house, listening in on you. Samsung claims to provide a service, but the only service we need from a television is to watch programmes." The Mail noted that more than half of all smart TVs sold in Britain are manufactured by Samsung.  The issue lies in the technology that was marketed as a convenience. These TVs listen for simple commands like changing channels or adjusting the volume, but they also have the capability to process more complex commands by recording users' speech and sending it to a third-party company called Nuance, located in the United States. Nuance then sends the voice data to a computer server, where it is translated into text and a response is generated.  Orwell's warnings about a surveillance society have proven to be eerily accurate. The prevalence of surveillance cameras, advanced listening devices, and the interception of digital communications by intelligence agencies are just the tip of the iceberg. Now, even our household appliances are capable of spying on us, blurring the line between convenience and invasion of privacy. As technology continues to advance, society must grapple with the consequences and question the extent to which”•É®      XÁ  Helicopter pilot Steve Irwin was left awe-struck when he witnessed an extraordinary sight from above: tens of thousands of sharks congregating just south of Palm Beach, Florida. While it is not uncommon for sharks to migrate to warmer waters during this time of year, Irwin's observation was anything but ordinary. He described countless sharks circling in waters devoid of visible bait-fish, a spectacle that left him astounded.  "This was truly an amazing sight," Irwin shared with reporters from the U.K. Daily Mail. With two decades of fishing experience and regular kayaking trips, he was familiar with sharks twisting and turning in the air. However, what astonished him this time was the sheer number of sharks present. As the owner and operator of Island Marine Services in Fort Pierce, Florida, Irwin estimates that around 100,000 sharks densely populated the shallow waters about 100 yards off the coastline, stretching for at least 20 miles.  What confuses experts is the lack of a specific reason why the sharks decided to linger in the area for such an extended period. "It's common to see large predatory sharks come in and feed on schools of bait-fish," Irwin explained. "The odd thing was I didn't see any bait-fish at all!"  This unusual shark phenomenon raises questions about potential connections to other perplexing animal events, including unexplained fish and bird deaths in recent months. However, it remains challenging to determine if there is any correlation between these incidents. The increase in shark numbers and the absence of bait-fish could merely be a mere coincidence.  For now, the mysterious gathering of sharks off the coast of Florida continues to puzzle both experts and witnesses alike.”Xö
  Tragic Death of Actress Brittany Murphy Raises Concerns Over Prescription Drug Use  It is not an ordinary occurrence for a person to suffer a fatal heart attack at the young age of 32. Typically, such a tragedy is associated with the use of chemical substances, whether recreational or prescription drugs. Reports indicate that actress Brittany Murphy, who passed away this past weekend, had been taking prescription drugs to alleviate flu symptoms, not to treat the flu itself. She was discovered collapsed in her shower after her heart failed. If prescription drugs are indeed to blame, this would mark another instance of a celebrity death caused by pharmaceuticals. Recent examples include Heath Ledger, Patrick Swayze, Bernie Mac, Michael Jackson, and Farrah Fawcett. Additionally, figures from the realms of politics and media, like Tony Snow, Tim Russert, and Peter Jennings, have also succumbed to the dangers of pharmaceuticals.  When accounting for both celebrities and non-celebrities affected by the pharmaceutical industry, the death toll caused by these medications is alarmingly high. It surpasses the harm inflicted by even the most notorious terrorists. The current state of the pharmaceutical industry is marred by scientific fraud, doctor bribery, misleading advertising, and corrupt regulatory agencies such as the FDA. In reality, most prescription medications fail to offer substantial benefits to most individuals. They merely mask symptoms while disregarding the root causes of diseases. The prevailing falsehood propagated by drug manufacturers is that their products will enhance one's well-being. This is why drug advertisements often depict cheerful, healthy individuals seemingly reaping the benefits of their pills, albeit without explicitly showing the act of ingestion. Instead, they portray people engaging in activities like yoga or hiking, creating an illusion of good health.  Regrettably, I struggle to identify a single pharmaceutical that genuinely improves one's health. Almost universally, these medications inflict long-term damage to vital organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and nervous system. As time passes, they deteriorate overall health, hasten the appearance of aging, and contribute to the development of chronic degenerative diseases. Unlike nutrients, which can enhance well-being and prevent illnesses, pharmaceuticals lack such capabilities. This is because the human body was not designed to process patented chemicals. Rather, it evolved to digest natural foods and nutrients provided by Mother Nature, as we learn in high school health class.  Though seductive, the notion that a pill can rectify all health problems is deceiving. Many individuals are enticed by this idea, including the late Brittany Murphy. She mistakenly believed that”XÍ   Viagra, the popular anti-impotence drug, has been found to reduce men's fertility by hindering the ability of sperm to fertilize an egg, according to a recent study conducted by researchers at Queen's University Belfast. Published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, the study involved two experiments to investigate the impact of Viagra on sperm cells.  In the first experiment, researchers exposed human sperm samples to weak solutions of Viagra, aiming to replicate the blood concentration obtained from a single 100-milligram pill. The results showed that while the Viagra-exposed sperm became more active, they also suffered damage to their acrosomes - the structures at their heads that contain enzymes facilitating the breakdown of the egg's membrane for penetration.  To assess the actual effect of this cell damage on fertility rates, the researchers compared two groups of male mice - one given Viagra and the other not given any drugs. Astonishingly, the mice in the Viagra group produced 40 percent fewer fertilized embryos than their drug-free counterparts.  David Glenn, one of the researchers involved, expressed concerns about fertility clinics that prescribe Viagra to increase sperm counts, potentially unknowingly exacerbating fertility issues. "Couples that go there for treatment are, by definition, already having problems getting pregnant. Giving male partners something that could make the problem worse is scarcely the right approach," Glenn noted.  Moreover, Glenn expressed worries about the long-term consequences of recreational Viagra use on fertility. With the drug increasingly used recreationally and even mixed with substances like cocaine, Glenn warned about the possibility of cumulative effects that could lead to significant fertility problems later in life.  This study raises important questions about the potential negative impact of Viagra on male fertility and highlights the need for further research to fully understand the consequences of its use.”XÑ
  In a move that highlights the growing concern over genetically modified organisms (GMOs), Russia has announced a complete ban on the cultivation of GMO crops. According to RT.com, a senior Russian government member stated that the cabinet had decided to exclude any genetically modified organisms or parts thereof from all food production in the country. Over the past decade, the share of GMOs in the Russian food industry has decreased from 12 percent to just 0.01 percent. Currently, there are only 57 registered food products containing GMOs in Russia. Furthermore, a law mandating the state registration of GMO products that may come into contact with the environment will take effect in mid-2017. This decision places Russia in a position to produce nearly 100 percent non-GMO foods for both domestic consumption and export.  This ban aligns with the preferences of consumers worldwide, as most individuals, given a choice, opt for non-GMO foods. However, in the United States, the Grocery Manufacturers of America, a controversial food industry group, is vehemently opposing GMO food labeling in an attempt to keep consumers uninformed about the contents of their food. The mainstream media, largely influenced by the biotech industry, has also failed to provide comprehensive coverage on the topic. As a result, independent platforms like GMO.news are gaining popularity among critical thinkers.  Hungary is following suit by striving to produce GMO-free food products for its own citizens. The country's Ministry of Agriculture considers maintaining a GMO-free agricultural industry as a matter of utmost strategic importance. The Hungarian Constitution even explicitly states the need to promote an agriculture free of genetically modified organisms. Hungary's efforts to reject America's Monsanto imperialism by producing GMO-free food for Europe are commendable.  Monsanto, widely regarded as one of the world's most malevolent corporations, has allegedly infiltrated numerous institutions in the United States, including academia, media, and government. By offering grants disguised as monetary bribes, the company has recruited a network of academics, creating a GMO experiment on a massive scale. The University of Florida's Dr. Kevin Folta, a prominent agricultural scientist, was recently exposed for financial collusion with Monsanto. This revelation gained attention even from the New York Times. The leaked emails between Folta and Monsanto shed light on the extent of their collaboration.  The use of Monsanto's genetically modified seeds not only poses a risk of genetic pollution and the potential collapse of food crops but also raises concerns over the widespread use of glyphosate, a cancer-causing herbicide commonly associated with GM crops.”XÂ
  Yelp Faces Lawsuit Over Allegations of Extortion  In the cutthroat world of business, finding innovative ways to enhance a product's value and boost sales is a constant pursuit. However, when these tactics fail, some companies resort to more aggressive measures - such as extortion. Recently, several small businesses filed a lawsuit against local business review start-up Yelp, Inc., claiming that the company's sales representatives offered to remove negative reviews in exchange for advertising purchases.   According to The Wall Street Journal, the owner of Chicago's Bleeding Heart Bakery alleged that Yelp suggested pushing any unfavorable reviews to the bottom of the bakery's listings on their website in exchange for a paid sponsorship. The owner further claimed that a Yelp sales representative offered to personally remove reviews deemed as "bogus." The lawsuit, filed by the original plaintiff and nine additional businesses, accuses Yelp of engaging in extortionate practices that disproportionately harm small businesses vulnerable to negative reviews.  Jared H. Beck, co-managing partner of Beck & Lee, the law firm representing the plaintiffs, highlighted the damaging effects of Yelp's practices on small businesses. "Yelp's practices are extortionate and especially harmful to small businesses, such as our clients, who are particularly vulnerable to reviews posted on the site," Beck told The Wall Street Journal.   Unsurprisingly, Yelp officials vehemently deny the allegations, dismissing the lawsuit as baseless. Vince Sollitto, Yelp's vice president of communications, attributed the accusations to a misunderstanding of the company's review filter, which aims to protect consumers from fake reviews and businesses from malicious attacks by competitors.   However, these complaints are not new. Last year, the East Bay Express newspaper published an article detailing similar allegations made by businesses claiming that Yelp sales representatives had offered to manipulate negative reviews in exchange for advertising sales. According to the report, a Yelp representative proposed "moving" a local restaurateur's negative reviews for a monthly fee of $299. The restaurateur also expressed concern that the negative reviews, which constituted the minority of his restaurant's feedback, seemed suspiciously prominent. "When you do get a call from Yelp, and you go to the site, it looks like they have been moved," said the owner, John. "You don't know if they happen to be at the top legitimately or if the rep moved them to the top. You don't even know if this is someone who legitimately doesn't like your restaurant. Almost all the time when they call you, the bad ones will be at the top."  Ultimately, the courts will determine”XÝ   Breast-feeding has been proven to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women, even if they have their first child later in life, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Los Angeles. The study analyzed data from the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study, which was published in 2003. Researchers specifically looked at data for women over the age of 54, with 995 of them having breast cancer and 1,498 without. By comparing their risk of breast cancer with their breast-feeding history and age at first birth, researchers found that breast-feeding decreased the risk of both hormone receptor-positive and receptor-negative cancers, regardless of the age at which the women had their first child.   Breast cancer is a prevalent issue in the United States, with 200,000 new cases reported each year. It is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the country. There are two main types of breast tumors: those that contain hormone receptors and those that do not. Previous research has shown that having a first child after the age of 25 increases the risk of acquiring hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, among women who have their first child before the age of 25, those who have multiple children have an even lower risk of breast cancer.   The findings of this study add to the growing evidence that breast-feeding provides protection against breast cancer, regardless of a woman's age at first birth. "As more women may choose to delay pregnancy until after 25, it is important to note that breastfeeding provides protection against both estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and negative tumors," said Giske Ursin, an associate professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. Ursin also highlighted that breastfeeding may have a protective effect that counteracts the increased risk of breast cancer associated with late pregnancies.”X
  Homemade shampoos have emerged as a promising solution to combat hair loss and foster hair growth. As individuals age, hair loss becomes an inevitable part of the process, but the utilization of healing herbs in homemade shampoos has proven to restore healthy hair. By facilitating the direct absorption of herbs into the hair and scalp, these natural herbal shampoos effectively encourage hair growth. Moreover, homemade shampoos offer an additional advantage by preventing the application of damaging chemical agents present in many commercial shampoos that can harm the hair.   Crafting homemade shampoos not only promotes hair growth but is also an affordable option. Opt for a mild soap base that effectively cleanses the hair without causing damage. Castile soap, known for its gentleness, is an excellent choice as it successfully removes oils from the scalp and hair shaft. Maintaining scalp cleanliness serves as a catalyst for hair growth. To stimulate hair growth, steer clear of soaps containing petroleum products as a base or chemicals listed on the label, as these ingredients impede hair growth and harm the hair shaft. Among the chemicals to avoid are paraben, methylparaben, propylene glycol, cetearyl alcohol, propylparaben, glycol, Polyoxyethylene, or distearate.   Essential oils and herbal tinctures are two effective methods for incorporating natural herbal remedies into homemade shampoos. To include essential oils, select alcohol-free variants and add one teaspoon to the soap base. Alternatively, herbal tinctures can be prepared at home using a process similar to making tea. This method involves using more tea and less water to create a concentrated solution. Add three teaspoons of herbs to six ounces of water, allow the mixture to steep for 15 minutes, and then strain out the herbs. Finally, add two ounces of the tincture to four ounces of soap base.   Nettles have shown remarkable potential in stimulating hair growth. These native plants can be harvested in the spring or summer and used either fresh or dried. In the absence of fresh nettles, dried herbal nettles can be purchased. Both varieties can be transformed into a tincture and added to the homemade shampoo. Similarly, rosemary, an age-old hair tonic in folk medicine, possesses stimulating properties that promote hair growth. By adding rosemary to a homemade shampoo, individuals can stimulate hair follicles, where hair growth initiates, and foster the growth and regrowth of hair. Rosemary blooms throughout the summer and can be harvested fresh for immediate use or dried”Xµ	  In a rush to conform to societal expectations, major retailers such as Amazon.com have announced bans on the sale of Confederate flags. This decision, driven by a desire to appease the masses and maintain social conformity, is not only foolish but also riddled with contradictions. Walmart, Amazon, Sears, and eBay have all made public statements about discontinuing the sale of Confederate flag merchandise, according to Yahoo News. EBay's ban was swiftly followed by Amazon's, which occurred just two hours later.  The growing public outcry against the Confederate flag has prompted online giants Amazon and eBay to join forces in banning the sale of flag-related merchandise, as confirmed by Breitbart News. This move comes on the heels of an article published by Breitbart News, which calls for the removal of the "fascist, Anti-Christian Gay-Pride flag" from government buildings. It appears that the collapse of tolerance and the rise of a dictatorial thought police have influenced these decisions.  The Confederate flag has been deemed "highly inappropriate" by these retailers, with the media playing a significant role in associating it with racism. This is reminiscent of the mass hysteria created by the mainstream media in the past, such as the baseless arsenic-in-wine scare or the measles outbreak at Disneyland. In a society where genuine tolerance has vanished, the demand for absolute cognitive conformity is now pervasive.  Amazon, in an effort to comply with the thought police, has hastily removed all Confederate flag listings from its website. Although a search for the flag may yield a few results, clicking on them reveals that Amazon has deleted the pages. One cannot help but wonder if Amazon will go as far as removing Dixie cups from its listings or pulling the first season of "Dukes of Hazzard" due to its depiction of a southern girl on the General Lee car, which sports a Confederate flag on its roof. To what extent will Amazon erase history, enforce popular revisionism, and cater to the hysterical masses?  In this society consumed by political correctness, it is worth questioning what Amazon deems appropriate for sale on its platform. It seems that simulated rape tools for the abuse of women are still acceptable, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.  Overall, the current state of society, characterized by extreme political correctness, prompts us to reflect on what is still deemed acceptable for companies like Amazon to sell online.”XÂ  Regular exercise and physical fitness have proven to be beneficial not only for physical health but also for cognitive health. A study published in the prestigious journal Brain Research in 2010 discovered that physically fit children aged 9 and 10 had significantly larger hippocampi, a region of the brain responsible for memory and learning. These children also outperformed their less-fit peers on memory tests. Furthermore, a research review released in the Cochrane Library in 2008 found that older adults who engaged in aerobic exercise on a regular basis scored significantly higher on tests measuring cognitive processing, visual and auditory attention, and even motor function compared to their counterparts who did not exercise as frequently. These findings strongly indicate that physical activity is crucial for optimal brain function. Neglecting to utilize our bodies not only affects our heart and lungs but also our brain and cognitive abilities.”Xl  North Carolina is facing backlash for its attempt to restrict free speech regarding health and nutrition. The state's Board of Dietetics/Nutrition has introduced House Bill 796, also known as the 'Modernize Dietetics/Nutrition Practice Act,' which criminalizes sharing health advice or food strategies with non-family members suffering from health conditions. The bill, which has already passed its first reading in the state Senate, prohibits unlicensed individuals from offering 'medical nutrition therapy.' This means that recommending dietary advice to a friend or teaching people how to overcome diseases through diet and supplementation would be illegal. The bill has been met with criticism, with Robb Wolf, author of The Paleo Solution, stating that it prevents anyone from communicating dietary advice to non-family members with medical conditions. North Carolina has a history of attempting to control its residents' lives, from banning raw milk to attempting to pass strict vaccination laws. This latest legislation is seen as an overreach of state authorities and an attempt to maintain the outdated healthcare paradigm.”Xß
  Superstorm Sandy, the devastating natural disaster that wreaked havoc on the East Coast, has left behind a trail of destruction, causing billions of dollars in damage. New York City, in particular, has been severely affected, with flooding, transportation shutdowns, and over ten million people left without power. However, as the storm subsides, a new threat emerges - the danger of looting.  With the sun setting and darkness enveloping the city, the combination of ongoing power outages, overwhelmed emergency services, and the cover of night provide the perfect opportunity for looters and violent criminals to strike homes and businesses. In a disturbing development, would-be looters are even recruiting "looting gangs" on Twitter, hoping to find accomplices to commit felony crimes while looting valuable items such as computers and televisions, potentially resorting to violence against homeowners.  While looters typically do not venture outside during a hurricane, the aftermath of the storm presents a real test of law and order, which could last for several nights. As long as the power grid remains down, looters have a window of opportunity to break into properties and steal belongings. Unfortunately, many areas will experience prolonged power outages due to continued high winds and severe flooding that has damaged electrical equipment.  Con Edison, the city's power company, was forced to turn off the electricity in much of lower Manhattan to protect the infrastructure. However, when power is eventually restored, it is expected that numerous electronics will be damaged beyond repair due to the flooding and explosions that occurred during the storm. The process of replacing the destroyed transformers alone will take weeks, further prolonging the power outage.  In response to the escalating threat of looting, the National Guard has been activated, and their presence may become more visible on the streets in the coming days, especially if looting becomes a significant problem. Another lesson learned from this disaster is the importance of bicycles as a means of transportation. With roads obstructed by stalled vehicles, fallen trees, and debris, bicycles have proven to be the most reliable mode of travel. If looters adopt this method, they could potentially evade law enforcement more easily.  The situation remains dire, especially for those served by the Con Edison substation that was destroyed in a series of explosions. The rebuild time for this critical infrastructure remains uncertain, leaving residents and businesses in the area without power for an extended period. During this time, the risk of looting and vandalism is significantly heightened. Local news sources estimate that it will take 7 to 10 days to restore power to many customers”X
  Mexico's Riviera Maya, a region known for its stunning natural beauty and popular tourist attractions, is facing a serious environmental crisis. The area, which stretches along the Yucatan Peninsula and includes the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, is being threatened by pollution that is seeping into the giant aquifer beneath it.  This pollution is coming from a variety of sources, including prescription and street drugs, chemicals from everyday products like shampoo and toothpaste, pesticides, and chemical run-off from highways. The contamination has infiltrated the vast network of water-filled caves in the area, eventually flowing out into the Caribbean Sea.  Scientists are concerned about the impact this pollution is having on the coral reefs off the coast of the Riviera Maya. Over the past two decades, about half of the corals in the region have been lost, likely due to a combination of pollution, overfishing, coral diseases, and climate change.  A recent study published in the journal Environmental Pollution sheds light on the extent of the pollution problem. Researchers from institutions including the Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health, Northwestern University, and Canada's Trent University found traces of drugs and chemicals from personal care products in the groundwater. These pollutants were primarily originating from domestic sewage, meaning that people are unknowingly flushing chemicals into the groundwater.  The study also identified other major pollutants, such as cocaine and its metabolite, triclosan (an antibacterial agent), synthetic musks (used in perfumes and deodorants), and common pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Additionally, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) pollution, likely originating from runoff from highways and solid surfaces, was found in the groundwater. Water samples near a golf course were also contaminated with pesticides.  While the drinking water in the Riviera Maya is currently treated with reverse osmosis systems, the study warns that this technology may not remove all micro-contaminants. Although the current levels of pollution are not considered harmful to human health, the study's authors emphasize the need for prevention and mitigation measures to protect both the marine environment and the region's tourism-based economy.  As the Mexican government plans to establish several medium-sized cities in the area over the next two decades, it is crucial to address these environmental concerns to ensure the continued beauty and viability of the Riviera Maya.”XB
  Breakfast cereal manufacturers have long been accused of misleading consumers through deceptive product labeling and marketing tactics that use the term "natural." Many consumers are under the false impression that this term guarantees that the product is free from genetically engineered ingredients and pesticide chemicals. However, a groundbreaking investigation conducted by the Cornucopia Institute is set to expose the truth behind these so-called "natural" brands. The Cornucopia Institute, known for its previous revelation of the use of hexane solvents in soy protein, is partnering with selfnews to bring this story to light. Exclusive articles and email alerts will be sent out to hundreds of thousands of subscribers, while the story will also be shared on Facebook and Twitter, as well as featured on the selfnews Radio Network and the Alex Jones Show.  Before delving into the explosive test results from the Cornucopia Institute, it is crucial to understand three key facts about genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Firstly, it is important to note that GE contamination exists in almost everything, including "non-GMO" food products, which often contain trace levels of GMOs ranging from 0.01% to 0.5%. Merely testing for the presence of GMOs is not sufficient; the crucial factor is the level of GMOs present in a particular food item. Shockingly, some of the "natural" items tested by the Cornucopia Institute revealed GMO contamination levels ranging from 28% to 100%, indicating that the key ingredients in these cereals are undoubtedly genetically engineered.  Secondly, it is essential to understand that GMO tests provide a fleeting snapshot that can change over time. Foods that currently test GMO-free may contain higher levels of GMOs in the future due to various factors such as supply line errors, contamination, and changes in supply sources. Conversely, foods that currently exhibit high levels of GMOs may test at lower levels in the future or even for different batches from the same manufacturer. Some manufacturers are misled by their suppliers, while others adopt a "don't ask don't tell" approach, avoiding GMO testing altogether.  Lastly, it is worth noting that products can be "enrolled" in the Non-GMO Project and still contain GMOs before they are officially "verified." The Non-GMO Project offers two designations for products: "enrolled" and "verified." The former indicates that the product is on its way to becoming GMO-free but has not yet achieved that status. Consequently, it is true that products enrolled in the Non-GMO Project may still contain significant levels of GMOs”XÆ	  In Australia, where it is currently winter, the flu season is in full swing. As is customary, health authorities have been strongly urging parents to vaccinate their children against the flu, assuring them that the vaccines are both safe and effective. However, many Australian parents have recently discovered the hard way that they have been deceived. After receiving flu vaccine injections, their children began experiencing convulsions, vomiting, and dangerously high fevers. Shockingly, one child even slipped into a coma and faces an uncertain recovery. According to a report in WA Today, a Perth mother named Bea Flint recounted how her 11-month-old son suffered a seizure shortly after receiving the first dose of the two-dose flu vaccination. Mrs. Flint described her horror as her baby became limp and unable to move, calling it one of the worst experiences of her life. Disturbingly, it was revealed that five children with similar symptoms were admitted to the hospital on the same day as Avery. This indicates that such occurrences were not isolated incidents. Numerous vaccinated children were experiencing severe convulsions, leading to overcrowding in emergency rooms across the country. What makes this situation even more alarming is that Australian health authorities disregarded the initial reports of convulsions two weeks ago, insisting that the vaccine was safe. Consequently, more children were injected with the vaccine, only for the convulsions to persist. It was only after several more weeks and numerous convulsing children that Commonwealth chief health officer Professor Jim Bishop finally announced the ban on the vaccine. It is important to remember that health authorities in Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have consistently asserted that flu vaccines are completely safe and devoid of harmful effects. In fact, the very same flu vaccine that is causing harm to children in Australia has been approved by the FDA in the United States, with the CDC insisting that all children in the country, regardless of age, should receive the vaccine. This raises the question of how many convulsing infants it will require in the United States for parents to realize the truth about flu vaccines. As you read this, you may be wondering what could possibly cause such convulsions in children. The answer is more terrifying than you may anticipate, as it turns out that the vaccines do not contain weakened flu viruses, as manufacturers claim.”X
  Newly released documents obtained by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) have revealed that the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been developing plans to implement a new wave of mobile surveillance technologies in public spaces such as train stations, stadiums, and streets. These technologies include eye-tracking, facial recognition, X-ray scanning, and whole-body infrared imaging. The most concerning aspect is that many of these technologies are designed to be concealed, enabling the government to conduct covert inspections of individuals in motion. For instance, individuals could be unknowingly subjected to X-rays from the DHS while walking down a hallway at a sports stadium as operators covertly scan them for weapons.   One particular project, as reported by Forbes.com, involves the use of backscatter X-ray scanners and video cameras mounted on roving vans, alongside other cameras on buildings and utility poles, to monitor pedestrians, assess their belongings, and even track their eye movements. Another project aims to develop long-range X-ray scanning to identify metal objects on an individual's body from a distance of up to thirty feet. It is already known that the US government has acquired 500 vans equipped with covert backscatter technology to discreetly scan individuals on the streets. These vans, known as "Z Backscatter Vans" (ZBVs), are part of the government's increased surveillance efforts, treating all Americans as potential terrorists and subjecting them to radiation scanning without their knowledge or consent.   Furthermore, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is currently testing full-power, deep-penetrating X-ray machines, similar to those used for chest X-rays in hospitals, to check for internalized explosives. This means that Janet Napolitano's administration now seeks to conduct colon inspections on individuals without their consent. These efforts extend beyond backscatter technology, and the government is willing to X-ray individuals without their approval in order to achieve their goals.   For those who find it difficult to believe that the US government is deploying covert scanning vans equipped with police state surveillance technology on American streets, the documents are publicly available on the EPIC website, totaling 173 pages. EPIC refers to these vans as "mobile strip search devices" due to their ability to see beneath an individual's clothing without their consent or probable cause, thus violating the Fourth Amendment rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.”Xt
  Taco Bell, in a bold attempt to lure customers back, has devised a plan to introduce alcohol at its new urban locations. The fast food chain intends to offer a range of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and "mixed alcohol freezes." The inaugural Taco Bell bar will debut at a carefully chosen site in Chicago this summer, promising a fresh approach to fast food. This innovative restaurant design has already been successfully introduced in South Korea, Japan, and the United Kingdom. As millennials have grown disenchanted with the brand's reputation for cheap fast food, Taco Bell, owned by Yum Brands Inc., is diligently striving to win them over. Marketers contend that millennials now favor restaurants with an authentic flair, eschewing the ordinary nature of Taco Bell. In an effort to shed its image as a run-of-the-mill establishment, the new urban Taco Bell will showcase a line of lime green stools and a bar that faces the kitchen, along with a brick wall serving as a platform for local artists to display their creative endeavors. By incorporating the work of local artists, Taco Bell aims to reestablish a sense of familiarity and community. The initial Taco Bell to offer alcohol and feature local artwork will be in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood. While the corporate headquarters of Taco Bell does not intend to transform its other franchises into bars, it does plan to remove contentious additives from its menu offerings. In a recent endeavor to revitalize its business, Taco Bell has announced its commitment to eliminating artificial colors and flavors from its food, as well as added trans fats and high fructose corn syrup. Although this represents a step in the right direction, Taco Bell fare is far from being considered healthy. In fact, partaking in Taco Bell food often necessitates a level of intoxication. Regardless of the restaurant's redesign, Taco Bell is still seen by many as epitomizing the depths of American fast food. Overindulging in this fare on a weekend may lead to Monday morning discomfort on the toilet, as these empty-calorie food items offer little nutritional value. Furthermore, doubts persist regarding the authenticity of Taco Bell's taco meat. Were the cows raised on genetically modified grains, antibiotics, and growth-stimulant drugs? Although some individuals may be able to tolerate this type of food occasionally, someone consuming Taco Bell once or twice a week would likely need to be under the influence of some substance to view it as satisfactory for their digestive system. The menu fails to offer anything resembling real food, let alone authentic Mexican cuisine. Perhaps this is why Taco Bell”Xµ  In a surprising turn of events, a respected doctor has brought attention to the flaws in mainstream medical practices that are intended to improve health but ultimately prove to be ineffective. Dr. Dwight Lundell, a heart surgeon and former Chief of Staff and Chief of Surgery at Banner Heart Hospital in Mesa, Arizona, has fearlessly spoken out against the inefficacy of pharmaceuticals and the need to challenge commonly held medical beliefs. Specifically, he has highlighted the detrimental effects of statins, drugs commonly prescribed to lower cholesterol. Dr. Lundell's comments are significant considering his extensive experience and training alongside other influential physicians who were considered "opinion makers" in the medical field.  Dr. Lundellâ€™s statements hold weight in confirming the suspicions of many individuals who have long believed that the conventional medical system is flawed. However, the industry continues to thrive due to its connections with influential entities and undisclosed business motives. Profits are made from the business of sickness. For instance, statin drugs have recently faced heightened scrutiny after researchers at Tulane University revealed that they have negative impacts on the aging process, hinder essential cell functions, and can lead to liver dysfunction, memory loss, cataracts, and diabetes.  The inadequacies surrounding heart health and pharmaceuticals are not the only medical issues causing concern. Dishonest practices in the field of cancer treatment are also coming under fire. There are unfortunate instances where doctors exploit the vulnerability of healthy individuals by falsely diagnosing them with cancer and administering unnecessary treatments. One such case is that of Dr. Farid Fata, an oncologist from Michigan who pleaded guilty to healthcare fraud and misdiagnosing patients. He manipulated patients into believing they required chemotherapy when they did not.  These revelations challenge long-standing medical practices and call into question the integrity of the healthcare system. As society becomes more aware of these issues, there is growing momentum for change in the medical field to prioritize the well-being of patients over profit.”Xz	  Toxic Compound Found in Everyday Consumer Goods Raises Health Concerns  A commonly used chemical called triclosan has been found to pose a potential health risk, as it has been linked to the promotion of cancer. What is even more alarming is that triclosan is present in a wide range of everyday items, including antibacterial soaps, deodorants, body washes, creams, lotions, cosmetics, cleaning supplies, detergents, dishwashing liquids, mouthwash, and toothpaste. Yes, toothpaste.  While toothpaste is typically used to clean teeth, a recent discovery reveals that it may actually be doing more harm than good. When toothpaste comes into contact with tap water, the triclosan reacts with the chlorine in the water, forming chloroform, a chlorinated aromatic compound similar to the dioxins found in Agent Orange. This chemical reaction takes place right in your mouth as you brush your teeth. Even after rinsing, research suggests that triclosan can remain in the mouth for up to 12 hours and easily be absorbed into the body through the tongue and mucus. This poses a particular risk for children, who tend to swallow toothpaste more frequently while brushing their teeth.  According to the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides (NCAMP), manufacturers of triclosan-containing toothpaste and soap products claim that the active ingredient continues to work for up to 12 hours after use. This means that consumers are exposed to triclosan for a much longer period than the 20 seconds it takes to wash hands or brush teeth.  "The amount of gas formed is very low, but I think the key thing is that we just don't know what the effects are," said Giles Watson, a toxicology expert. Watson advises consumers to avoid products containing triclosan if they have concerns, as manufacturers are required to list it as an ingredient.  Triclosan has been officially classified as a probable human carcinogen by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Union.
